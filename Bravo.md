## First Datepocalypse

```
4 - 10 players.

Each player takes a turn vocally progressing the story and outlining their actions.

Each phase listed below consists of two player turns. Turns are taken by each player in a clockwise direction.

INTRODUCTIONS
Each player introduces their own fictional character. The player that has last gone on a date introduces their character as the first lover. They always go to pick up their date from the home of the second player character. 

Both players decide on the date location and time. 

The third player should be in attendance of the date location, such as an employee, and so should every other player thereafter except the last player. They will always introduce themselves as the antagonist. Example: a jealous ex-girlfriend.

CONFLICT
There should be a creative and surprising stand-off between everyone in the game.

CONCLUSION
Each player rolls 1 six sided die for their character. If a 6 is rolled their character is uninjured. If any other number is rolled the next player describes how the previous player character has died.

Whoever is alive after the last round are more than likely drenched in blood and psychologically scarred. Wrap up their actions in one sentence.

## The ArrrPG

```
Ye be a pirate. Come up wit’ a name and pick four of Agility, Brawling, Cunning, Folklore, Luck, Magic, Marksmanship, Roguery, Seafaring, Streetwise, Survival, or Swordplay t’ be good at.
When th’ Cap’n thinks somethin’ has risk t’ it, roll 1d10 (+2 if ye be good at it.) Total of 8+ means ye do it. If ye be good at Luck ye can reroll thrice per session.
If ye be wantin’ a fight, th’ Cap’n will have ye roll 1d10. Startin’ with 10, he’ll count down t’ zero; when yer number comes up, declare what ye do. If ye be makin' an attack, ye both make yer rolls. If yer roll meets or beats yer target’s, he loses Life equal t’ yer weapon’s rating plus how much ye beat him.
Fists, Pepperbox: 0
Dagger, Harpoon, Handaxe, Pistol: 1
Cutlass, Musket: 2
Saber, Blunderbuss: 3
Cannon: 8
Ye’ve got 10 Life. When ye run out, to th’ depths with ye!
Yer ships has 40 Hull; Life fer ships.
Ye get 1 Booty fer succeedin’ on a roll; at port, spend 10 t’ recover yer Life, fix yer ship, learn a new skill, or buy weapons, shot, or healing elixirs.

## Advent

```
Over the next five weeks, an outlandish, distressing event will turn your little community upside down. The exact nature of the “Advent” is to be discovered in play, if at all.
Each week, the event will unfold and generate new trials as well as new opportunities for you, the heroes, to explore. 
At the start of the week, one player interprets what challenge the event brings from the weekly thematic statements below. Another describes a personal opportunity arising from the event: something about greed, power, faith, love or second chances. The remaining player(s) play out how their character seeks help, resources or solutions to overcome the challenge and decide if they seize the opportunity.
The players then switch roles around the following week.
The consequences of the Advent can be evaded, limited or fought, but can neither be stopped nor reversed.

Timeline
Week 1   A breach in the ordinary appears

Week 2   A terrifying growth

Week 3   Friends turn into foes

Week 4   Roots of the community are threatened

Week 5 	 The outside world has stopped responding

Epilogue The Advent is part of the new normal. Discuss how your community        
                 has changed as a consequence, if it’s still standing.

## Eternal Rivals

```
Two samurai meet under a blossoming cherry tree to settle a life-long feud. 
Hands on the hilts of their katanas, they wait for a moment of clarity to strike.


Setup:
Each samurai takes 10 six-sided dice and hides them behind a folded piece of paper. 


Play:
One samurai narrates a way in which the other was insulting in the past.
This can be anything: from having eaten with the wrong-coloured chopsticks to having slept with the Daimyo’s daughter.

The other samurai must defend his conduct.

Each one then secretly takes a number of dice to hold in his hand (from 0 to 10). 

Both players roll them simultaneously. 

Each 4-5-6 is a winning die: 
The player who has the most winning dice has won the argument and sets the winning dice apart in their victory pile. Ties go to the insulted samurai. 
All the other dice are discarded in shame.

The narrating role is exchanged until all dice are in victory piles or discarded.
 

End:
Both samurai take their victory dice and roll them one final time.
The one with the most winning dice kills the opponent. 
A tie means that both samurai kill each other.

Honor must be avenged!

## Reuinited And It Feels...

```
It's been too long, or maybe not long enough, since you saw one another. But here you are. Just the two of you. In public, but alone, together. You have business to sort out, and maybe a relationship to rebuild, or maybe to bury. But you have to get through the silence to do it.

Meet in a public place; a coffee shop, an airport, a bar. Somewhere you can hear people talking. Sit together in silence, listening to the voices in the air.

When you hear a joke, or laughter, remember and reminisce on the connection you used to have. When you hear silence, or sadness, remember and emphasize what drove you apart. When you hear anger, lash out in fear, or else they might first and then you've lost the fight (wait, was this a FIGHT?). When you get caught up in a story, get lost in your memories; ignore the other player. When you hear the nondescript buzz but no emotion, focus on what brought you here, and try to get it over with.

When you've said all you can say, decide if it's worth rebuilding your relationship. Hopefully it is. It's okay if it isn't.

## There Is No Way Out Of This Arena

```
This is a game about gladiatorial combat, for 2 core players, and, optionally, any number of observers.

One person plays The Gladiator, and one person plays The Arena. The Gladiator describes what they're fighting for (glory, God, survival, the thrill) and why they're in the arena, and rolls 1d100 to determine their health at the start of the game. Each round, The Arena rolls 1d20 to determine the damage they inflict on The Gladiator. They then describe what challenges The Gladiator faces, and The Gladiator describes how they defeat them, if they still have health left, or how they are defeated, if they don't.

If there are any observers, they play The Audience. They describe who is watching the battle and how the audience feels about it/The Gladiator themselves. In their Mercy, The Audience can, once per game give an extra d20 to The Gladiator, to put off the end for a little longer. Or, should they so choose, they can give their extra d20 to The Arena, which can be a Mercy, too.

The game continues until The Gladiator is out of health, but can easily be started again.

The Arena is always ready for another Gladiator.

## EPYC

```
​Everyone needs a long sheet of paper and a pen. 

Understanding the past is tricky. ​Somewhere amid the myriad accounts, legends, songs, and artworks might hide a truth. This is a world building game. We're not looking for the truth; we're creating fragments.

In the top fifth or so of your paper write the name of a long-lost people and describe where and when they lived.

Pass your paper to the right.

On your new paper, create some art (e.g., drawing, lines of a song) from that people. Copy their name on your panel and fold the paper so only your art is visible.

Pass right.

On your new paper, describe some lore (e.g., myth, folk cure, urban legend) from that people. Copy their name on your panel and fold so only your lore is visible.

Pass right.

On your new paper, write a first person account of some major upheaval or cultural event the people experienced or celebrated. Copy their name on your panel and fold so only your account is visible.

Pass right.

Repeat: Art, Lore, Account

When you’ve no more room, reclaim your paper. Try writing a short textbook entry about the people you named.

## The Last Summer

```
You are teenage students in a hostile town. In one tragic summer, each of you will lose your lives. But your story will be told. It won’t be forgotten.

You are not: white, male, straight, cisgendered, or considered normal. This is why you die, and in many cases, helps explain why life was hard. After picking one or more of those traits, flesh out your characters.

Games of blackjack decide the result of encounters. If you beat the Dealer, you win the encounter, but revenge will follow. If you bust or fail to beat the Dealer, you lose. A character must play blackjack at least once a month.

The game starts in June. School’s out. Trouble is afoot. The Dealer must play blackjack with everyone at once.

July. Revenge approaches. The Dealer only plays blackjack against pairs or trios.

August. Death follows. The Dealer plays blackjack with only one character at a time.

September. The story ends for everyone. Contemplate every encounter. Tell the stories of how you died, either by homicide or suicide. After you do so, speculate on how the world changes for the better, even if you don’t get to see it.

Take a deep breath.

## Alien Zookeepers Go!

```
Requires: Two+ players. Some way to share short videos and pictures you’ve drawn on. 

You are alien naturalists, disguised as humans, capturing/documenting unseen fourth-dimensional animals that populate this planet.

What’re your names? What alien institution do you work for?

Mostly, blend into Earth society. But sometimes, discover a new specimen. Send a short video describing how, then a picture of the animal. You’ll have to draw; Earth cameras can’t capture the fourth dimension. Don’t forget a name!

Other players ask two questions each. Examples: What sound does it make? How’s it useful? How’s it cared for?

Amplify your magnificent discoveries. Downplay the significance of others’. Always tell the truth.

The other players write a report describing their impressions of your find. Homeworld’s watching, be honest. Include name, summary and rating (1-10), based on uniqueness and importance/usefulness of the animal.

Occasionally, ask for an update on a previous specimen. Check the rating. Five or less: they share a picture/video describing an unexpected talent/feature + a charming anecdote of bonding. Six or above: describe a complication/danger + the unfortunate way it was discovered.

Play until you’ve captured all the interesting creatures here. Destroy the planet as you leave.

## The Perfect Moment is Now

```
Required: Deck of Cards

Something is always messing with the time stream.  If it’s not scientists in strange contraptions, it’s teenage wizards with wyrd watches.

You are Time Wardens.  Devoted to maintaining the "correct" order of History. It’s your job to untangle time paradoxes.

Situation: Someone has interfered with History. 

Objective: Resolve the temporal interference.

Character creation: Assign 3, 5, 7, 9 uniquely to each attribute:

Hearts: Social.

Diamonds: Mind. 

Clubs: Strength.

Spades: Speed. 

Session start: Deal 5 cards face-up. This represents the next 5 Actions that should occur.

If a character wants to attempt an action that might fail, they must spend a face up card. If it can’t fail they succeed without spending a card.

After spending a card, discard and replace it.

Players must spend cards from left to right. Players can spend a card out of order, if they discard all face up cards.

The action fully succeeds if
the spent card’s suit matches the appropriate attribute 
and the number on the card is less than the skill rating. 
Partial success if only the first is true.

There is no turn order.

When the deck runs out the GM narrates whether History was maintained.


```
<hr> 

## SuperKid - a game for one adult and one child

```
You create a story about SuperKid, who saves a person/a city/the world from a villain/disaster/impending doom (decide each time you play). An adult is the GM, a child is the Player.

Together, write down at least 5 characters from your favourite movies, books or comic books. They will be SuperKid’s allies or otherwise relevant to the story. You can use them anytime you feel appropriate. 

Player chooses one SuperKid’s superpower.

GM narrates the story and creates Challenges, player declares SuperKid’s actions, how would she overcome Challenges, and asks questions about the situation. The GM then gives the Player a Task. If she completes the Task, SuperKid succeeds. If she fails, she may try again or you can help her.

Example Tasks: do 10 jumping jacks, spot 10 red cars, 7x8=?, capital of France, spell a word.

Example Challenges: enemies, monster, someone needs help, fire, water, earthquake, villain escapes, betrayal, unexpected obstacle.

After SuperKid completes her mission, Player can choose one new superpower.

Play to have fun. You are on SuperKid’s team, you both want her to succeed and overcome even the most difficult Challenges. Make the Tasks fun and engaging, but not too hard to complete.

## Heliophage

```
One night you have a dream in which you eat the Sun.
When you wake up, you discover you are now the most powerful being on Earth.
You are yourself. 
You can fly.
You can lift impossible weights.
You can move at supersonic speeds.
You are invulnerable.

What will you do? 

Set a goal.

2 - 5 players.
1 player is the Heliophage, everyone else is the World.
1dF per World player.

Heliophage says what they do. 
Nothing can stop them or harm them.

The World presents complications.
This is not a comic book world, this is the real world.
Real physics. 
Real politics. 
Real people. 

Real consequences.

Heliophage rolls the dice, assigns one to each complication.
“+” means positive outcome. Heliophage narrates.
“-” means negative outcome. World narrates.
“  “ means delayed outcome. World narrates. Next roll includes the delayed complication as well. No additional dice. Complications with no dice assigned have negative outcomes.

No other metahumans. 
No aliens.
No mad science.
No magic.

Just you, with the power to do what thou wilt, and a world powerless to stop you.

Play until the Heliophage attains their goal or gives up on it.

Heliophage narrates their epilogue.
The World narrates the aftermath.

The end.

## Tripping Over Yourself

```
The players function together as a single, very clumsy adventurer.

Pregame
Each player picks one or more of the following to control
8HP
  Left Arm
  Right Arm
10HP
  Left Leg
  Right Leg
15HP
  Head & Neck
20HP
  Torso & Center of Gravity
∞HP
  Mouth

Conflict Resolution (CR)
•Players want to do something
•GM and players argue over which limbs are involved
•Each involved limb rolls 2d6 individually
      ◦10+	resounding success
      ◦7-9	success
      ◦4-6	failure, Can Be Saved (CBS)
      ◦2-3	failure
•If CBS, another uninvolved (or minimally involved) limb can, within reason, roll to recover from failure, such as an arm grabbing a chair if the legs fail
•Player controlling multiple limbs? Roll for each
•In combat roll to succeed, then...
      Each limb that participates in attack / defense rolls 1d6 +weapon / +shield added together for final damage / defense
      Subtract defense from enemy damage for actual damage
      Any held object can give +weapon / +shield, it’s up to the GM

Every physical action, including walking, talking, opening doors, and grabbing objects, requires CR.

Limb HP
1+	Perfectly fine
0	Useless
-10	Chopped off

GM Combat
•Choose HP for enemy
•Roll 2d6 for success (>=6 is failure)
•Roll nd6 damage / defense, “n” depends on the enemy

## Racer

```
Racer is a game about fast cars, tight cloths & family.
You’re a racer in a family. Families pull heists and protect their turf.

Racers have three stats: Racin, Talkin & Family
To start split 13 points between your stats. Stats never exceed 10.

In Racer, everyone describes what they’re doing until you’re not sure who wins. 
When this happens roll a d10.  If the result is under your stat you succeed. The difference between your roll and your stat is your style. Style can be negative.

We talkin’ or we racin’?
Can’t tell if you’re talkin or racin? If your mouth is movin you’re talkin.
If your family has your back you may roll Family.

If the roll is opposed. Participants roll their stat. 
Results under the stat are successful, you don’t crash or embarrass yourself.
Highest Style wins. lowest roll breaks ties. Still tied? It’s a draw.
The winner raises or lowers one opponent's stat by one. Opponents aren’t always enemies.

Racers live fast knowing death lurks in every corner. The only way to hurt a racer is to hurt his family. If your Family reaches 0 you become an NPC.

End of game: Racers increase one stat by one.
```
<hr> 

## Playing Cards RPG

```
You are the Dealer. You can forge worlds, people, and timelines using nothing but a deck of cards (no jokers).

Forge Champions
Start by taking all of the face cards out of the deck. (You’ll shuffle them back in after chargen.)
Deal three cards to each player and have them assign each to one of the three attributes: Physique, Expertise, and Personality.

Each character beings with 1/2Physique+3 health points (round up). If hp<1 that character is dying. Resting restores 1hp.
Each character has skills/items equal to their Expertise.
Each character knows NPCs equal to their Personality.

Forge Adversaries
People, places, and paraphernalia will impede the characters. They have a difficulty of Easy (+2), Medium (+5), Hard (+9), and Impossible (+14), and 0-8hp.

Forge Trials
When characters act they test one ability. Reveal a card off the top of the deck. Add Difficulty. Subtract Ability. Their character succeeds if the result is ≤5. If the character fails by 5+, he takes 1 damage.

Beware Anomalies
Anomalies are events paradoxical to the universe. You know these as face cards. When you reveal one an Anomaly occurs.
The nature of anomalies, and any other rules, is up to you.

```
<hr> 

## Squamous

```
You are each eldritch abominations, taking human form for nefarious purposes.  Your human vessels are… weak.  Disgusting. Meat. Always sweating, defecating, desiring. How do humans tolerate this?


Each abomination has a secret eldritch Goal.  Write down a noun and a verb.  Give the noun to your left-hand player and the verb to your right-hand player.  Combine the noun and verb you receive for your Goal. Take 15 d6s. You succeed at your Goal when you have no dice.

Describe your human appearance and identity.


Each player has authority over a human Need. Things like hunger, hygiene, sexual desire, romance, social acceptance. Name yours.


Take turns framing scenes where you perform tasks to achieve your Goal. Other players roleplay NPCs, describe scenery, etc.  

When they describe how their Need complicates your task, they offer 2-5 dice.  Roll one die. 

If you roll higher than the number of offered dice, the Need causes problems. Take the offered dice.  

If you roll lower, you resist the urge. That player takes back their dice and the die you rolled.  

If you roll equal, then you succeed at your task even while still succumbing to the Need. Discard all rolled and offered dice.
```
<hr> 

## A walk in the park

```
Pick a breed of dog to enjoy a day out in the park all walked by the same dogwalker.

One person plays the dogwalker (GM) everyone else is a dog.

Each dog has three traits (rated 1-6) size, derp and speed. 
Max trait is 5. Size + Speed has a maximum of 6.
All traits have a base of 1. Players have six extra points to spend on traits.
Derp indicates the general adoring, but stupid, nature of a dog. It's the opposite of wisdom.
Each dog picks two secret goals (Eg get muddy, chase ducks) The Dogwalker approves them.

Tests are rolled against a d6, if the roll is lower than the trait it's a success. Task difficulty may give bonus/penalty. 

The Dogwalker starts by passing a stick to the player to their left and describing the scene that the dogs see.
That dog has the stick and describes what they try to do until they fail a test or complete a goal (getting a point). Other dogs wait their turn.
The stick is then passed to the next dog for their turn.

Once the stick has gone around four times total the points to decide who has won.

## Cryptozoo

```
People have become bored of lions and tigers. Zebras? Whatever. Gorillas? Pfft. The future of zoology is with weird creatures: Sasquatches, Death Worms, Chupacabra, Mothmen. Take your limited budget, track down the leads, and bag your zoo a headliner!

Cryptozoo requires four+ players, each with pencils and paper. You begin with $1000 each. The first player, selected randomly, writes down the name of a Cryptid. Other players [the Hunters] write down an environment and type of bait; these are their conjectures.

As a Hunter, you may Research, which costs money. To Research, you must first agree to a dollar amount with the Cryptid player, and then show them one of your conjectures. They react as they see fit. You can then alter your conjecture if you want. Continue until all Hunters are satisfied.

Reveal the Cryptid. Hunters debate the merits of their conjectures, and decide who most logically catches the Cryptid.

The Cryptid player and the successful Hunter split any money spent on Research.

The successful Hunter then picks a new Cryptid and play continues.

Go until your zoos are full, or your wallets are empty!﻿

## Blaze of Glory

```
Once, you were the greatest spy in the world. 

Now, you have been poisoned by your former employers, and you are about to die.

It’s time to get your revenge. It’s time to go out in a Blaze of Glory.

Agent and Employer each take one standard deck of playing cards. Aces low. 

Employer takes a card from their deck, looks at it, and plays it face down, narrating a challenge based on the suit (challenge type) and number (difficulty). 

Hearts: Social
Diamonds: Security
Spades: Environmental
Clubs: Combat

Agent takes three cards from their deck as their Hand. Each suit represents an Approach to the challenge. 

Hearts: Suave
Diamonds: Gadget
Spades: Stealthy
Clubs: Violent

Agent plays one card and narrates how they tackle the problem based on their Approach. 

Flip the challenge card. If Agent’s card is higher, they succeed, taking out one or more of their betrayers. If Agent’s card is lower, they succeed with difficulty and discard a number of cards from their deck equal to the difference between their card and the challenge. 

Employer continues by playing the next card.

After Agent plays their last card, they die in action, going out in a Blaze of Glory.

## The stars going out, one by one

```
As a group, decide the premise:

Everything is finished.  The Great Work was [completed]/[thwarted]/[abandoned] [long ago]/[during your lifetime]/[just now], and the Final Threat was [defeated]/[victorious]/[postponed].  You didn’t play a big role.  Now, all that’s left is your [solar system]/[space station]/[ship], and a rapidly shrinking light horizon.  The universe has [several generations]/[one generation]/[less than your natural lifespan] left.  Escape [is now]/[was always] impossible.

All characters/factions/places have an:

Attitude towards the end:  [denial]/[anger]/[bargaining]/[depression]/[acceptance]. Players can’t choose Acceptance.
Attachment:  [technology]/[cultural symbol]/[ordinary household item].  This Attachment is the last of its kind and irreplaceable.  There are no duplicates or sources of new Attachments except for other characters/factions/places.
Advantage or Disadvantage.

To resolve disputes:

Roll 1d6 vs the gm’s target number or an opposing character’s roll.  Everyone loses ties.
Relevant Advantage(s), another character helping, minor use of Attachment: +1d6, drop the lowest.
Relevant Disadvantages(s): +1d6, drop the highest.
Full use of attachment - reroll retroactively, or roll d10s.  Give up the Attachment forever.

Combat:
3 successful attacks makes a character helpless.
You cannot take an Attachment unless every Character defending it is helpless.

## The Dreaming Giant

```

A girl in a village is told by her grandmother a legend about how their whole world is actually the dream of a great giant, represented by a mountain silhouette in the distance. After the story is done, an earthquake takes place and some of the villagers disappear. She figures that it’s because the giant is waking up, effectively killing the dream. 
This prompts out protagonist to travel the world and collect stories from its inhabitants to go tell the sleeping giant to keep him from waking up. As she travels she encounters an array of characters, some who believe the legend, some who don’t.
 Collected stories can be used to solve puzzles and open doors along the way. 
As a final test, she finds the King of the land trying to wake up the giant for good, thinking it’s better like that than to live in someone else’s dream. The girl then has a choice, to help him wake the giant up or to stop him and let things stay as they are.

## Heisters

```
Four players are committing a heist.  Backstabbing is expected.

Equipment:
	* ~40 blank cards
	* Pens
	* d6

On four cards, write:
	* From who?
	* Steal what?
	* Where?
	* When?

Shuffle and deal. Clockwise, players write their answer. Arrange cards in the centre, face up.	

On separate cards, write:
	* 1st
	* 2nd
	* 3rd
	* 4th

Shuffle and deal.  Players describe an obstacle guarding the loot.  Arrange cards in the centre, in order, face up.  Repeat for 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, obstacles preventing escape, but arrange face down.

On two cards each, players name a beneficial skill.  No duplicates.  Shuffle and deal face up.  Equipment automatically accompanies skills.	

Each player writes two secret plans: an obstacle imposed upon one other player (they roll to avoid); or thematically prevent being incapacited (you roll to escape.)  Reveal at any time.

The team encounters obstacles in order.  Any player describes how they overcome the obstacle for the team, rolling d6.  To succeed, roll 3+ if skilled, or 5+ if unskilled.

The obstacle is overcome even if failed, but describe how you're incapacitated.  You can't act.  Create an obstacle someone else must overcome to save you.  Saving you is optional.	

Divide 60 points equally between players who escape.  Highest ongoing score wins.
```

## Diceless Deeds

```
Required: 1+ players, 1 GM. Pen and paper recommended.

Pick a name, four skill proficiencies and a handicap (suggestions are listed below).
Pick one of your skills to be your expertise.

## The Ark

```
The Ark is old and adrift in a sea of stars. The would-be settlers have long forgotten the destination; now only know as the Promised Land. The Ark is feeble, life support systems are barely hanging on. The Ark is famished, clean water is life and food is used as currency. The Ark is broken, massive areas are now cold wastelands, toxic sludge seas or exposed to vacuum. The Ark is a maze, equipped with pipes and plastic shields, many adventurers have been lost searching for the Promised Land in the lower levels. The Ark is dangerous, the lower one goes the more dangerous and cold it gets. Malfunctioning maintenance robots, automated garbage furnaces, toxic sewage rivers, feral animals, sudden exposure to vacuum and sludge men, are some of the many dangers in the Ark. The Ark is populous, there are many communities scattered throughout. Some are able to trade with each other but most were isolated during the “accident”, they now have their own language and culture. The Ark is rich, some communities mine the ice shield that surrounds the Ark. But doing so let’s cosmic radiation in and can cause horrible mutations. The Ark is Home.

## Groove Crusaders

```
In a dystopian future the world has been deprived of all fun by the army of evil magicians know as the Haters. Banning all music and fun from the world, they overtake it in the name of boredom and general badness. But four legendary warriors have come together to combat the haters with four legendary instruments of the elements. Now they must travel the land to save the world from lethargy.

The game will be an RPG that mixes the menu combat of JRPGs with the funky grooves of rhythm games. Each party member will have their own instrument that has a dedicated face button, which they have to time with the music to perform an attack. Each attack increases the player’s score, wherein they need to reach a certain threshold to win the battle. When they win a battle they gain experience to level up which will increase the player’s score multiplier that make it easier to win harder battles with strict scores. It will also allow them to buy alternate weapons. These weapons act as modifiers that alter their score. These include changing note speed for increased scores, or pressing one button for any note that decreases score.
```
<hr> 

## Unanimous

```
Unanimous is played with 4 or more people. One person is The Overseer, and everyone else is a Survivor.

At the start of the game The Overseer describes The Situation, taking suggestions as desired. Pick something that is perilous but survivable.
Next is the Survivors’ turn. One at a time each Survivor flips a coin. Heads is hope, tails is tragedy.
Hope: describe how you find something important and how it helps.
Tragedy: describe another aspect of The Situation and how you try to fix it.

After they describe their contribution to The Situation the others vote. If they think the contribution was helpful to surviving they raise their hand. The Overseer may also vote.
Voting Survivors are unanimous: Success
Votes at least equal to voting Survivors: Success
Votes less than voting Survivors: Fail

After all Survivors have taken a challenge The Overseer continues to describe The Situation, and the challenges begin again.

If a Survivor fails three challenges they are dead and they are longer counted while voting, though their actions while alive still affect the group

To survive The Situation the group must have a number of successes equal to twice the number of living Survivors.

## Giant Monster Mayhem

```
Players each pick a role. Two must be a Kaiju and a Hero, use more roles for more players. More player than roles? Use multiple bystanders. Each role has a goal:

Kaiju - destruction and mayhem.
Army – slow down Kaiju
Bystanders – survive
Scientist – discover Kaiju’s weakness
Hero – defeat the Kaiju

To play: each round is a contest between the Kaiju and one other role. The Kaiju describes what they are doing and the other player narrates how they react.  A duel is held.  If the good guys win, the contest moves to the next role in the order listed above. If the Kaiju wins the process starts over from the top. The only way for the players to defeat the Kaiju is to win the final duel between the Hero and the Kaiju. The Kaiju wins if the other players give up.

To Duel – players simultaneously hold out 1-4 fingers. Total the count:
Odd total – Kaiju wins. Go back to the top of the conflict chain.
Even Total – Citizens win. If you are the Hero describe how the Kaiju is defeated. If you are not the Hero, play moves to the next contest.

## Of Light

```
The God of Light has weakened and Darkness surrounds you. Only you and a handful of believers can save Light from extinguishing.


Sit in a dark place.

Light a candle of any length. This flame is Light’s existence. If the flame goes out, Light perishes and you are consumed by Darkness.

Take turns proclaiming your feats in the name of Light by saying this phrase:

“By the [POWER] of Light, I [ACTION]”.

Replace the word [POWER] with words such as magnificence, glory, love or anything that shows your respect and devotion to Light. Once a word is used, write it down. No one can use a word already used before.

Replace the word [ACTION] with any feat you’d do for Light, such as “attacked the shadows of Darkness”, or “sang of Light's promise”.

After proclaiming your phrase, throw a die. The number you get is how many points of belief Light got from your phrase. Write it down.



Keep doing this until all of you collectively gather 100 belief points. At this point, Light is revitalized and will award the believer with the most points.

## Endless Descent: a game of Secrets and Hope

```
“Bring a guide,” cautioned the innkeep, but you knew better. A one-way door, a bad choice – and you became trapped in this endless dungeon, staggering onwards as you hope to escape. Has it been months? Years? Who even built this? With every room you’ll face monsters, traps, long-kept secrets, and your desperate dwindling hope.

SETUP
Describe your adventurer to the group: your capabilities, appearance, personality, needs, and flaws.

As a group, name and describe one party member who has died. Why did they matter?

Determine one secret about yourself and one about the adventurer on your right. Write them down, keep them secret.

PLAY
Take turns. Choose to reveal a secret or have a secret revealed about you; then jump forwards or backwards in time to describe a new dungeon room to explore. Describe combat, traps, temptations, supplies, or clues, but focus on party dynamics. End each scene after the secret is revealed and its ramifications roleplayed. What changed?

The game lasts 2 scenes per player.

ENDGAME
Reveal the final secret to end your explorations – whether through death, rescue, escape, or something else. If appropriate, go around the table one final time to describe your hero’s epilogue. 
```
<hr> 

## Asylum

```
You are a patient in Helgrim’s Home for the Criminally Insane. Your goal is to escape before Dr. Helgrim and his eight-legged orderlies can feed on you.
Your Sanity starts at 10. To interact with the Supernatural, such as casting a spell or banishing the demon Nurse Lilith back to her nest on the sixth floor, Overcome your Sanity by rolling above it on a 20 sided die. If you succeed, reduce your Sanity by 1.
To interact with the Mundane, such as picking the lock to your cell or convincing a fellow patient to give you his map, Test your Sanity by rolling below it. If you succeed, increase your Sanity by 1.
If you fail a roll, something happens to complicate your escape. Dr. Helgrim and his orderlies are after you!
The game ends if you escape the asylum or:
If your Sanity reaches 20: You’re “cured.” You can no longer interact with the Supernatural, but you'll never forget the things you saw.
If your Sanity reaches 1: You become enlightened. You can no longer interact with the Mundane, but you'll never forget where you came from.

<hr> 

## TROLLS

```
You are a troll: an under-the-bridge, ugly-as-sin, billy-goats-gruff troll.
 
Fortunately, you chose a bridge with a good wifi connection.
 
Make up an internet handle and write it down for everyone to see.
 
In secret, write down three physical aspects about which you, the troll, are extremely insecure. DO NOT draw on you, the player’s, insecurities.
 
The last troll to finish their list starts by stating their opinion on a topic, real or imaginary.
 
SPEAK ONLY IN TROLLSPEAK.
 
CALL CHARACTERS ONLY BY THEIR HANDLE.
 
IT IS YOUR JOB TO PURIFY THE INTERNET OF WRONGNESS.
 
DO THIS BY INSULTING OTHERS' LOOKS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE.
 
WHENEVER SOMEONE MENTIONS ONE OF YOUR ASPECTS, EVEN IF NOT AT YOU, YOU MUST RESPOND IMMEDIATELY.
 
NO PHYSICAL CONTACT WHATSOEVER.
 
If any troll thinks they have figured out someone else’s aspects, they can yell "BLOG POST", at which all other trolls must fall silent while the first enumerates those aspects.
 
If right, the attacked troll cannot blog post anymore. If wrong, the same happens to the attacker.
 
Play continues until only one troll can still blog.
 
End with a group pact "by the name of [winner's handle]" never to speak or write as you have just done.
```
<hr> 

## Symbiosis

```
You are all organs in a strange alien’s body. You’ll need at least three players. List an organ name, one feature, one purpose and two processes to achieve it. On squares of paper, devise at least two common problems an unusual alien might face in day-to-day life. Place these, folded up, in a bowl.

One at a time, draw a piece of paper and explain how you the organ will overcome this obstacle to the best of your abilities. If other organs agree with your methods, they will describe how they’ll help. If they don’t agree, antagonistic organs can interfere. The initial organ’s solution counts for 2 points, a helpful organ’s assistance counts for 1 point and a hindering organ’s obstruction counts for -1 point. If the organ scores more than zero, the process goes ahead and the body continues. 

If the organ’s solution is not suitable, an interfering organ may suggest a new solution and the other organs agree or disagree once more. The game continues until all problems are solved or the organs refuse to work together leading to total systemic failure.

## Magical Elemental Girls Excel!

```
The characters are magical girls, whose powers are based on chemical elements.
In their late teens, they form the state sponsored team for their home city.
Their college is next door to their HQ.
When not on duty or at college, public relations activities occur.

Character Generation
Write down three things about the character’s backstory.
Select their element and a signature item that relates to the element.
Choose the highlight colour of their uniform.
For each category below spread seven dots.
The signature item has one dot.

Attributes
Body, Mind and Soul

Skills
Four things the character is good at.  These are not powers.

Elemental Powers
Three magical powers granted by the element.

Mechanics
To act, combine one Attribute with one Skill and/or one Elemental Power. Add the Signature Item if it’s relevant. Dots become d6s rolled. 6s are successes. More successes add benefits. 1s add complications.
If the signature item rolls a 6, keep the success and roll again.

If the target of an action has more successes than the actor, then these count as 1s when determining the result. During danger, dots equal to the degree of success are lost as damage. The signature item is impervious.

## Trash Pandas

```
A heist game starring raccoons.

The Gear:
4 humans
20D6s + 1D6 (for Glitter)
A high-sided box

The Cast:
Ringo; clever - Shake the box after seeing the results.
Mittens; crafty - Your roll succeeds on 3+.
Porkbutt; big ‘un - Pick 2 numbers.
Glitter; wild - Roll for your number, that die counts. Keep it.

Start with Ringo and The Approach.

The Turn:
Put the dice in the box and SHAKE, but don’t peek. Pick a number from 1 to 6. Peek! Pull out matching dice. (If none match, tell your raccoon’s zany misadventure. Pass the Turn, but not the Phase.) Pass dice clockwise, giving 1 to each person until gone. Each rolls, on 4+, add a successful detail and return the die to the box. On a 3-, introduce a goofy complication and discard the die. 

Pass the box to any player. They start the next Phase. Continue until the Score, or all the dice are gone and you bust!

The Phases:
The Approach
The Opposition
The Twist
Plan B
The Score -  Everyone secretly picks a number and one SHAKES the box. Each match is a delectable treat for you! 

Scenarios:
#1: The Cat Flap, CATS!, Fishtank...
#2: Dumpster, Its Massive Bulk, Locked!

## At the End of the World

```
The world is ending. Why?

You are together. Maybe you’re the only people who knew it was happening, maybe you care about each other above anyone else, maybe you have nowhere else to go, maybe there’s another reason entirely.

Where did you live, before? What did you dream of? What do you want now? What’s your secret? How do you feel about the others? How do you feel about yourself?

Scene 1 - 7 days to go:

You’re on a beach together. What does it look like? 

You know now that there’s no hope. Are you angry? Scared? What have you lost? Will you comfort each other? Argue?

Scene 2 - 4 days to go:

You’re on a beach together. What does it look like? 

Do you give into despair? Try to give the others false hope? What do they need? What do you need?

Scene 3 - 1 day to go:

You’re on a beach together. What does it look like?  

Do you need to talk? Can you bear to be silent? This is the last chance to tell the truth.

Scene 4 - 1 minute to go:

(Set a timer)

You’re on a beach together. You say goodbye. Hold hands. Then silence.

## Catch the Thief

```
Catch the Thief is an RPG for three or more players and a GM.

The players are in a town surrounded by impenetrable mountain forests, with only one road out of the town. At some point, any one of the players may become the thief. The game ends when the thief leaves town or is caught.

Each player takes a pencil and a square grid sheet. They state their unique starting location, and write it in the middle of their own sheet. The GM secretly adds those locations randomly to their own sheet. Only the GM knows where the locations are relative to each other.

In turn, players state their location and either move North, South, East, West, or interact at the location.

If players interact, the GM creates the story with them.

If players move, the GM informs them, secretly or publicly, of their new location. This will be either a previously visited location or a new one. If new, the GM chooses what to  add to the map.

Throughout the game, players will track their locations, items, and stats on their sheet. And the GM will decide rewards, consequences, and what players must roll to succeed.

## River, Typhoon, Coursing River

```
You are a travelling warrior.

You are searching for something. What?

People describe you like an element. Which?

You have trained in a style. Which?

When you face opposition in your actions, you both roll six-sided dice, one each. Highest roll gets their will across. On tie the player wins. A helpful element or style gives you one extra die. A cool description of your action gives the player one extra die. Help or equipment lets you reroll one die. The more higher dice than the opponent, the better.

You may also spend Energy to gain extra dice. A player starts with 3 Energy and the Journeymaster starts with 12. Spent Energy goes to the opposition. You lose energy for every step you lose a trial. When you lose a trial with no energy left your journey ends.

The Journeymaster can spend on Energy to create an opponent or a trial harder than one die. Defeated opponents Energy returns to the Journeymaster unless given to a player. Opponents can only use their own Energy

When the Journeymaster has no Energy left the remaining Warriors find what they were searching for and their story ends.

## Kazooki Theatre

```
You’ll want at least five players, each with their own kazoo. Use of other musical instruments is at your own risk. Set yourselves in a circle.

Agree the starting situation and elect a starting player.

The starting player says one word to begin the story, the next player says the next word, and so on. Keep going round one word at a time.

If a player is stuck for a word, or if they want play to go faster, they can pick up their kazoo. From now on they no longer speak but can play their kazoo at any time in order to support the unfolding story (please try not to drown out the other players.) 

Each time a kazoo is picked up, the remaining players should aim to advance the plot and/or escalate the situation until only two players remain. The final pair should bring the story to a conclusion with the rest of the players providing dramatic musical support!

The two remaining speakers should then bring play to a close by speaking in turn the words “the end”. Then everyone should play a final musical flourish with their kazoos.

```
<hr> 

## Group Troop

```
The game starts with every player writing down a social group on a piece of paper. This can be anything, from "tango dancers" to "people who like white chocolate". Everyone picks a group note at random, and the game begins. From there everyone takes turns, starting with the oldest player present, stating a cliche or a trait they imagine people in their group share. So, if you've got tango dancers you might say "muscular calves", at which point anyone with a group who shares this trait repeats it, in this case that group might be football players. The game ends when each group has been identified and each group has matched traits with at least two other groups. 
```
<hr> 

## Pantheon: A Game for Narcissists

```
You are gods. Start with a creation myth and take turns telling your tales of glory, but be mindful of the rules of myth. When you're done playing, tell the story of your world's end.

The Ruler's word is law. Only an enemy would oppose it directly.
The Spouse always has the Ruler's ear. Whether toxic or wise, all words have their limits.
The Warrior always decides who lives and dies. Death is not the end.
The Reaper always knows the truth of things. The strands of fate are never cut by mortal blades.
The Trickster will always do as they please. 

When the gods war on the earth below, describe your champion and how they fail. When the gods fight in the heavens above, take sides and declare what you lose. When the end comes and the light fades from this world, describe your final hope for the future.

## An American Workplace

```
One player is the Boss. Everyone else is an Employee. Every 15 mins is considered one Workday in-game. The game ends after five Workdays, or a Workweek.

Employees start the Workweek with 10 Work Tokens. They need to have at least one Token by the end of the day, or they’re fired by corporate for not getting any work done. At the beginning of a new Workday, they get one new Token. Employees can only have 10 Tokens max.

The Boss is lonely and wants to be appreciated, usually by making bad jokes, performing magic, or pulling off some other crazy, usually inappropriate antics. Because of this, the Boss is distracting.

While the Boss is doing their thing, Employees have to keep a straight face—this means they’re working. Smiling, cringing, sighing, or laughing means that the Boss has successfully distracted them. When an Employee is successfully distracted, they lose one Work Token.

Some Employees might care about each other. They can give each other Tokens.

By the end of five Workdays (an hour and fifteen minutes), whoever still has Work Tokens wins and gets to relax for the weekend, knowing their job is safe.

… At least until Monday.

## Constitution

```
Set just after a revolution. It's time to build a new government. Elect a convention president to govern the process and ensure fairness. The convention president must designate a secretary to record the laws. Once the president gavels the convention to order, anyone can propose any law including laws to govern the convention itself. You must come out with a system of governance defining the creation of new laws, the execution of such laws, the arbitration of such laws as well as laws defining finance, foreign affairs, military matters, and human rights. These can be one person or many, republic or despot. You have ten months to define a government. Anytime a law proposed is passed in accordance with the rules of your convention, you may continue. Anytime a law is defeated in accordance with the rules of your convention, a month passes and the rabble comes closer to dispensing with you and instituting anarchy. At the end of ten months or the constitution, the president shall call for each area of government and the secretary shall read aloud the laws as stated. Upon completion of the reading, the convention votes to ratify or not. The decision must be unanimous.

## Limbo, the otherworld

```
You see the grim silhouette of a man pushing a pole in a mechanical rhythm. You realize you are on a boat roaming across a river towards a misty shore. You realize you have died…
When you get to the shore the ferryman (and so the GM) raises his hand silently. How do you pay him? 
The player must actually hand anything in his current possession to the GM or maybe run away, but there will be consequences.
The ferryman leaves you and the mists thicken up. You hear horrible screams and sounds. How do you hide? 
The player must actually try to hide wherever in the room – if the GM can see any part of him without moving but his head, he is caught by a slaver and is locked in a cage (under the table, in a closet, etc).
Repeat this to every player alone. If they cannot hide they will just pile up in their small cell. Now the players that escaped can explore the Limbo and its horrors, while the players that where caged will be performing slave’s tasks (preparing snacks for the GM, for example). Eventually they may find each other. 
Enjoy the Otherworld.

## A Single Point Of Reference

```
Ideally played by two people. 

Inside a big room the first treaty between an alien race and the human race is being negotiated. Outside, two people at the bottom of the hierarchy are sitting and waiting together. 

Player One: an alien who has learnt the language from text, but has no other references for the world. They must ask the other player(s) to explain things. 
Player Two: must describe what is being asked without relying on anything but the most basic definitions of things. 
Player One: can ask for clarifications on things if they feel Player Two is relying too much on assumed knowledge. 

Example questions:
What is the colour “burnt orange”?
What is family?
How does coffee taste?
What does lying in the sun feel like?
What is a cat and why would you want one in your house?
What is love?

Players should feel free to act out or use their surroundings, but the internet is not allowed. Playing in libraries encouraged.

Player 2 wins when Player 1 feels like they would understand the important aspects of whatever they asked. They don’t have to answer the question, though.

## Monstrositea

```
You are a terrible and refined monster. This means you are monstrous in deed and aspect, but also attend tea parties.
Come up with a good name and title(s), along with three signature monstrous traits. Write them on a placecard and put it in front of you while playing.

This is to be played around a table with a cake or other suitable dish. Play begins when you slice the cake and ends when the group finishes with it. Other refreshments may be served, but do not keep time. For an alternate experience, play with a large pitcher of drink on a porch.

During tea, you have five basic moves that may be combined however you wish:
>Boast of your terrifying deeds
>Complicate the boasting of others with dramatic twists
>Smalltalk about the minutiae of your monstrous life
>Gossip about your friends and enemies
>Verbalize any monstrous actions taken that you, the player, cannot physically take

Once play ends, vote as a group on who was the Most Charming and who was the Most Terrible. In cases of ties, players share in these honors.

## 3d13 via cards & introducing roll choice

```
A combat or skill resolution mechanic.

Each player draws 5 cards from a 52 card deck.  Anytime a ‘roll’ would be required, play 3 cards.  May choose 1, 2, or 3 cards from your hand before turning over the remainder from the deck.  Add the value of the cards displayed for a total between 3 and 39.  3’s and 39’s are criticals.    Draw back to a hand of 5.  Reshuffle discards when need a new draw.

Optional: may turn in a poker hand of 5 cards for a degree of epic success, being more epic the higher value of the poker hand.  Straight flush > 4 of a kind > full house > flush > straight > 3 of a kind.  2 pair and 1 pair are considered insufficiently awesome.

The GM should use a 2nd deck for monsters so that player and GM luck is balanced in separate pools.

An ace may be 1 or 11.   King = 13.  Queen = 12.  Jack = 11.  

Optional: Divide by 2 to map to 1d20.  Divide by 2 and discard kings to map to 3d6.

## PUPPY DAY: A happy game wherein everyone wins

```
You're visiting an animal rescue shelter to adopt a pet. Yey!

Sit in a circle.

Everybody writes a pet animal (e.g. kitten, dragon, goldfish) on a card. Put them in the circle face-up.

Everybody writes a pet quality (e.g. shy, one-eyed, clumsy) on a second card and keeps it--except the shortest player, who puts their quality card face-down in the circle and goes first.

On your turn, pick a face-up card and approach that animal's cage/pen/tank. The players on your left and right offer you their quality cards: take one. Describe the pet you meet. How does it greet you?

If this isn't the pet for you, tell us why and put the animal card back (but keep the quality card).

If you want this pet, keep the cards. Tell us how you will make it feel at home and leave the circle with your new friend.

The player without a quality card goes next.

If you're the last without a pet, take the remaining animal card and the face-down quality card. Tell us why your new friend makes you luckiest of all.

Everyone share your pets' names!

11    Video Games        Villain            Demanding
12    Cartoons        Anti-Hero            Manic

Player Roles:
Narrator: The referee tells the story and determines outcomes.  Fans: The other players. 

How to Play:
1. Create fans and figure out how they know each other.  
2. The Narrator sets up Part One, describing the convention and action and then giving each fan a scenario where they are the focus. 
The players and narrator tell a three-part story. Each character has one scenario per Part. Scenes take 5-10 minutes. 
3. In Part Two players describe the events of their scenario, but the narrator guides the story, adding complications and determining outcomes. 
If in doubt use a challenge of some kind (roll highest on 1d6, rock/paper/scissors, thumb war). Describe and move the story logically. 
4. In Part Three the narrator describes what happens to each fan. Players can demand challenges.
```
<hr> 

## Anxiety

```
This game is for one narrator and three to six players.

The narrator tells the story of a protagonist’s average day and divides the day into twice as many Events as there are players.  An Event is a minor daily action, like riding the bus or going to lunch.  As the narrator describes the protagonist going about their Events, players will take their turns, one player per Event, and every player gets two turns.

The game:
The narrator describes an Event in detail, then a player turn consists of the player giving voice to an errant thought, worry, or doubt the protagonist has.  After describing how this thought impairs the protagonist, the narrator and player each flip one coin.
    Two heads: the protagonist is unimpeded
    One head: the player describes how scared and weak the protagonist feels
    No heads: the player narrates the protagonist’s feelings and failings
The narrator adjusts the story going forward.  Repeat.

Continue until all players have had two turns.  The narrator then describes the fate of our protagonist.

Post game:
The players win; anxiety always wins.  Hug each other and go out for lunch.

## Word Wizards

```
One player is the Word Master, the rest are Word Wizards.
The Word Master will open ten random Wikipedia articles and create an adventure based on them.
Word Masters, don't feel restrained by the articles, they're your tools, some work well as settings, characters and items. Others serve to guide the tone and mood.
The Word Wizards open three Wikipedia articles each, these are your Magic Words. Use them to overcome obstacles that the Word Master presents to you.
If none of your Magic Words would be of use you can Word Dive by clicking on any linked Wikipedia article on your current words. 
Once you click, that is your new Magic Word and cannot go back, unless your current article has a link to a previous Word and you Word Dive again.
Every time you Word Dive you revive Word Drain. Mark it down. If you hit 10 Word Drain points you lose your Word Magic. 
The Word Master can also Word Dive, but doing so clears one point of Word Drain from all Word Wizards.
Conflict is resolved by each player opening up one random Wikipedia article, whichever title is higher in the alphabet wins the conflict.

```
<hr> 

## The Rapid and the Raging

```
Setup:
	3-6 players. Two index cards each.
	On one card write a city and its Problem. Something entrenched, like “Corrupt cops.”
	On the other card, write a character, their vehicle, and Problem. Something simple, like “Out of coffee.” 
	Characters start in First Gear.

On your turn: 
	Move your character to another player’s city. 
	Explain how you’ll solve a problem (yours or the city’s) the only way you know: with illegal street racing.  
	Race. 
		-The city’s player narrates the course and obstacles (using Problems as a guide). 
		-You narrate your driver. Other drivers in the city can race too, to aid you.
		-Narrate sick driving stunts appropriate to the gear you’re in: 
			--First: world-class. Navigate effortlessly; ramp off anything.
			--Second: effectively supernatural. Drive across water, up walls.
			--Third: physics-defying. Outrace bullets, plow through trains, fly. 
			--Fourth: magical. Become wind, control storms, drive through time.
			--Fifth: transcendental. Embody pure Driving.

		-When you’re ready to win the race, shift into the next higher gear and narrate your victory and its aftermath:
			--Gears 2-4: Solve the Problem, replacing it with a worse one. 
			--Fifth: Solve your Problem and the city’s outright.

Take turns in any order. 

Solve every problem. 

Celebrate your victories together.

## The killing action

```
A supplement for BlackHack-based games
Every character starts with a d20 Risk die. Every day the character kills a sentient humanoid creature they role the risk die.
The first time they fail they must choose the path of either Remorse or Hatred.
Once they have chosen a path, each time the risk die ticks down: Remorse, create a rule of behaviour around killing that justifies it in your character's mind, e.g. refuse to draw your sword first, pray for each of the souls you take; Hatred, choose one species you have killed since the last time your Risk die ticked down to join the creatures you hate, your character wages a genocidal war against their hated species, seeking to kill non-combatants, destroy settlements, poison water supplies and so on.
Once the risk die is exhausted: Remorse, the character retires from a life of violence; Hatred, the character is no longer interested in pursuing any goal except their hate and refuses to interact with those who don’t share their beliefs.

## One-Night Stand

```
You are two lovers. Think of a name; describe three good qualities you have and two you see in the other. They’ll be tested through play!

Describe yourself.

Describe a place where you can have sex. 

Remember: sex is consensual. Otherwise it’s rape.

Play five scenes: begin describing sex between the lovers. Choose a quality of your character, roll 1d4 and frame a flashback about it; the other player will describe how your quality is...

    1-real: this makes things significantly better;

    2-real: this makes things embarrassing.

    3-not real: this makes things worse;

    4-not real: this improves the situation;


You can cancel a roll and decide the outcome for yourself by burning one quality the other lover has seen in you. They decide which one and describe how they realize their mistake, during sex.

Flashback contents (scene order):

    1: how the lovers met (both roll);


    2-3: Why each lover decided to have a wild night out;


    4-5: Who each character is and what their life looks like.

After last flashback: describe how sex ends. If both lovers still have one of the qualities the other saw in them before, decide what to do next. If not, they will never meet again.  
```

## And then there were none

```
A short mystery/slasher game for up to ten players

We are trapped in an enclosed space. One of us wants to kill us.

All together, we first…
Discuss the era: medieval, Victorian, modern, sci-fi,…
Discuss the setting: isolated island, castle under siege, traveling boat or spaceship,…
Discuss the killer’s motive: revenge, justice, madness, hunger, intrigue,…

Each turn, each character still alive rolls a white d10.
Who gets the lowest result gets killed.

Each turn, each character murdered rolls a red d10.
Who gets the highest result narrates how the victim is killed and gain one point.
During the first round, the victim narrates.
Describe when, where and how. Establish the scene, add good details, and give some clues about the killer’s identity. Narrate the death: be gory, be horrific, be subtle.

If you want to influence who the killer is, you can give their player your red die to roll. You can change your mind at any moment.

When the last character is killed, who has the most points reveals themselves as the true killer. Obviously, they weren’t really dead. They narrate the epilogue, explain how they faked their death, and reveal their motive in details.

## Escalation

```
ESCALATION
How far will you go to get what you want?

Two players control the same alter-ego.

Character Creation

Determine your desire

What do you want more than anything? 
What’s stopping you from getting it?

Choose your initial Humanity score: 3 - 5

All actions require a Humanity roll (1d6). To act with compassion, roll under your Humanity to succeed. To act ruthlessly, roll over your Humanity to succeed. Rolling equal to your Humanity fails.
 
After every action, move your Humanity up or down by 1 (min. 1 / max. 6).

Game Play

Escalation – Player 1 narrates what is happening until you must choose to act with compassion or ruthlessness.

Tough Choice – Player 2 chooses & makes a Humanity roll. The same player describes the outcome and decides whether to move your Humanity up or down.

The next turn, Player 2 escalates and Player 1 chooses.

The first escalation must tempt you to act ruthlessly by playing into your desire. The first tough choice must be to act ruthlessly and automatically succeeeds.

Play until your alter-ego has fulfilled his desire, alienated everyone, or is dead.

Epilogue

The higher your Humanity at the end of the game, the happier you are.

## Death by Chocolate

```
Requires: 
Game board and cards from the game Candyland
Piece representing each Child player.

Setup: 
Choose a player to be the murderous chocolate factory Owner. Other players are Children touring the factory. Each Child chooses a virtue and vice. Place pieces at Start.

Play:
The Owner describes each fantastical, candy-filled room of the factory and the deathtraps tailored to the Children's vices. The Children try to survive the rooms and escape the factory. The last Child left alive inherits the factory and lifelong nightmares.

Whenever a Child attempts something difficult/dangerous, they draw a card. If the card’s color matches their current space, they succeed.

If the card does not match their space, they may move forward to the next space of that color and succeed. 

If it's a double card, they must move forward two spaces of that color to succeed. 

If it's a location card, they may move to that location and succeed even if it is behind them. If they do, they also find an ally or item to help them.

If a Child draws a card and there aren’t enough spaces of that color ahead of them, they are killed in an ironic and candy-themed manner.
```

## Down the rabbit hole

```
A game for two players, who take turns playing the PC and the Narrator.

Shared PC creation: Age? Gender? Role? Hobby? Strength? Weakness? Some main friends/family/coworkers? 

Toss a coin to decide who goes first as Narrator.

Begin like Alice, following the rabbit down the rabbit hole into Wonderland, where the usual rules don’t apply. In Wonderland, the Narrator describes nonsense scenarios, which should include twisted elements of the PC’s real life, while the PC reacts/interacts. After five minutes, cut the scene, swap roles.

As Narrator, you don’t need to directly follow the previous scene, but build on what has gone before; remember to ramp up the tension and weirdness. (Remember the Red Queen: ‘Off with her head!’)

In the seventh scene everything builds up to a crisis, then just as it’s all about to go badly wrong, the PC wakes up in the real world. Swap roles one last time: Narrator describes a vestige of Wonderland which appears in the real world. End.

## Office Party

```

Six+ players
Boss is whoever brought the most booze. They pick two middle managers. Everyone else: Labor.

1st round: Gossip & Shots!: One shot for the boss, two for managers, three for labor. You take more shots the lower down you are to represent your powerlessness and need to drink. 

Everybody has a secret. What’s yours? Write it down, then roll 1d20. Compare rolls with the player to your left and your right. Higher roll gets the dirt and a favor(The Boss rerolls 1s & 20s and adds 2 to their roll)unless you roll…

1: You are shitfaced. Let your coworkers know what you really think of them.  Tell the boss off. Quit like a legend. (You’re out.)
OR
20: They did the thing. You have pictures.  You have a veto. 

2nd round: Team Building Exercise: Remaining players give favors to force shots or block them. No favors? Make the Boss laugh with a work story to gain one. Veto holders can accept or deny shots with impunity. 

Final Round: Hostile Takeover! Everyone rolls 1d20. Favors add +1, vetoes add +2. Highest roll joins the 1% and wins, everyone else gets laid off. Good Luck!

```
<hr> 

## Other Lives

```
Each player describes a person they saw on the street recently with one sentence of physical description, and one imagining who that person is. These descriptions are shuffled and each player receives the character they will be playing. Shuffle a deck of cards. Each player draws two cards and describes: 
Hearts: a need your character has.
Clubs: a sin your character has committed.
Diamonds: a significant item your characters possesses. 
Spades: a place your character has a relationship to.
Players can add more details to flesh out the story. All characters must have at least one connection with another character.
Play proceeds over the scope of a number of scenes equal to thrice the players. Starting with the first player, draw a card at the start of each scene. The suit will determine the center of conflict for the scene (need, sin, item, place). The other players then decide on which other character(s) should be in the scene. The story can skip forwards and backwards in time. After about two minutes of scene time, draw a card. A black card means the scene resolves favorably for the current player’s character, a red means it does not.

```
<hr> 

## Captain's Table

```
You are a sea/sky/starship captain at a dockside tavern.

Starting RESOURCES: three SKILLS, three SCARS, no SUPPLIES.

Each captain shares their story. Who (or what) are you? How did you become captain?

In turn, swap tales. Roll 2D6 against the captain to your left. Winner names a tale of your adventures: strange folk, dangerous creatures, hidden places. Loser chooses:

    FOLK: dynamic discoveries or fearsome foes
    CREATURES: fearsome foes or terrible treasures
    PLACES: terrible treasures or dynamic discoveries

Tell the tale together. Others prompt: "Is it true that...?"

For your tale of:

    DISCOVERIES: +1 SKILL
    FOES: +1 SCAR
    TREASURES: +1 SUPPLY

Continue until a captain says, "...and that's how I wound up here," gaining +1 RESOURCE. Other captains each tell another tale.

Recite your SKILLS, SCARS, and SUPPLIES.

Someone calls you a liar. A brawl looms.

Secretly select one ally, then reveal. Allies pool resources and act as one. If chosen captain doesn't reciprocate, take +2 SCARS and you are WOUNDED.

In turn, pick another captain to attack, rolling 2D6 <= SKILL. Hit captains roll 2D6 <= SCARS or are WOUNDED; if WOUNDED again, they DIE. Consuming a SUPPLY allows rerolling.

Those killed describe their fates. Winner tells tale of triumph.

## Game Cartridge Monsters

```
Friends in the late 1980s uncover dark monsters and must save their town. They discover that video game cartridges can be used to capture monsters! They scramble to build their own catching equipment and power suits and before the monsters take over! 

Need one deck of cards, but only 9 cards of each suit. 

Card values are irrelevant. Flip one card per turn. Make a column for each suit, with rows for each set of 3 collected. Record HP, XP, equipment built, and monsters captured.

Start at 20 HP and 0 XP. 

Every Heart heals 1 HP. 

XP (Diamonds) follows this structure:

1st-3rd collected: +1 XP
4th-6th +2 XP
7th-9th +3 XP

Parts (Clubs) structure:

After the 3rd part is collected, you build the PCC pocket cartridge catcher. 
6th: ESC entertainment system catcher
9th: SUPER super entertainment system catcher.

Monsters (Spades) structure:

1-3 Kawaii. 3 XP with a PCC will capture it. If not captured, -3 HP. 

4-6 S. Class. 5 XP with ESC. If not, -4.

7-9 Kaiju. 10 XP with SUPER. If not, -5. 

Catch a monster and you can plug its cartridge in to power up your suit! Track your high score!

## Long is the Way, and Hard

```
A Devil and Angel war for the soul of a Penitent undergoing five Trials on the path to Salvation . . . or Damnation.

Needed: 1 card deck, 10d6 each

NB: face cards = 11; ace = 12

Spread 5 cards (Trials) face-down. Deal 5 cards and 10 dice to everyone. Keep cards secret. Pass your highest card right and lowest left.

Introduce the characters and the nature of the pilgrimage---who, why, from/to where.

Contend. To influence the Penitent, the Angel and Devil play a card face-down. Wager dice (Influence). Reveal cards. Winner keeps their own Influence; loser gives 1, discards remainder.

The Trial. Penitent wagers Influence, then reveals 1 Trial. If the Penitent can’t beat it, 1 Influence goes to the Contend winner. Discard remainder. If win, 1 Influence from both Angel and Devil.

Resolve. Trial card suit determines scenario theme to resolve, win/fail:
Heart = empathy/generosity | callousness/pettiness
Spade = humility/piety | social conflict/hardship
Club = pacifism/de-escalation | physical conflict/hardship
Diamond = asceticism/conservation | materialism/gluttony

Judgment. The Penitent arrives and is judged (by whom?). Deal 5 cards face-down. The Penitent takes ALL Influence and rolls. Compare Influence total to card total. Resolve Judgment, flavored by Angel/Demon Influence.

## Fusion Dance

```
First, name your team of heroes. Then, write down your character’s name and personality. Distribute 7 points among your stats, which are FIGHT, STYLE, SMARTS, and CHARM.

Write down a power for your character, like pyrokinesis.

Pick a signature item, a weapon or tool.

When you take an action, the GM chooses a target number. Roll D6 equal to one of your skills, and count each 5 or 6. If you have equal to or more than the target number, you succeed. For each success above or below the target, use another adverb to describe the success or failure. Write conditions and wounds on your character sheet.

Fusion: Two willing characters can fuse. If this is the first time that combination has fused, create a new character sheet for their fusion. The fusion’s stats are the base character’s added together. Agree on a new personality, power and item that are a combination of the base character’s.

All of the fused players must agree on each action. If the fused players at any point can not agree, they unfuse. 

Whenever the GM offers fused characters two options, she may make them answer in secret. If they answer differently, they unfuse.

## A 5-day walkathon

```
You’re all wealthy, high class stars in a futuristic steampunk world where time is the ultimate luxury. In a world where everybody drives around on their steam powered unicycles, walking is the utmost display of wealth.     
 
Over the course of five real life days, players battle to reach the highest level of wealth that is in correlationto the amount of steps they make during that period. Every day the step count will be used as currency in a silent auction for “walking canes”, which have a value in points. 
1st and 2nd day - bronze cane (2 points)
3rd and 4th day - silver cane (3p)
5th day - gold cane (5p)

Prior to bidding, all players should tell a story about their journeys in the steam punky lands, what they saw, who they met etc. - so other bidders could estimate their competitors’ “wealth” and then bid accordingly.

Highest bid will be revealed and person whose it was will get the auctioneered cane. Winner loses the bidded steps, rest of the players won’t. Rinse and repeat until end of day five. In the end of the last auction, points will be summed up and person with the most points wins.

## Six Days Remain

```
You and your classmates are about to graduate from MAGIC COLLEGE. Decide on a name and major for your character. (Majors might include alchemy; divination; herbalism; daemonology; illusioncrafting; dungeoneering; cursebreaking; geomancy; and so on.)

As a group, pick six locations on campus and assign them the numbers 1-6. (Places on campus might include classrooms; dorms; the cafeteria; the student union; the bookstore; statues; fountains; distinctive-looking trees; sports fields; and so on.)

Graduation is in six days. Every day, roll 1d6, then visit the corresponding place on campus and reminisce about an experience you had there. Roll 1d6 again to determine how the memory makes you feel:

1 - resentful
2 - regretful
3 - wistful
4 - mirthful
5 - grateful
6 - hungry (or thirsty)

As you narrate the memory, be sure to talk about why it makes you feel this way.

If multiple people visit the same place on the same day, the experience is a shared one, narrated collectively by everyone there. (Different people might feel different things about the same memories. That’s okay.)

After graduation, narrate an EPILOGUE together. Discuss what you did after graduating and how your relationships with the others are today. Did everyone stay in touch?

## Love Language

```
You are a person. You have wants that you must pursue, fears you try to avoid, needs you must have meet, traumas that follow you, language you use to show love with, and a goal you need others to help you achieve.
Love Language requires 3 to 5 players, notecards, and a pencil.
The table chooses a Challenge. Then each player writes their character’s name, traits, and relationship to the other characters on a notecard.
Traits are:
Wants (if you achieve it 1 Check)
Needs (if you fill it 1 Check)
Fears (if you face it 1 Check)
Traumas (if you overcome it 1 Check)
Love language (how you show and receive love, if you speak or experience it 1 Check)
To complete a Challenge everyone needs to have at least 3 Checks.
After Character creation, go around the table framing scenes. You get Checks when someone frames a scene that deals with one of your traits. Continue framing scenes until everyone has 3 Checks or the table chooses to stop.
When you are ready to complete a Challenge frame a scene of all the characters completing it. When you are done epilogue your characters and their relationships.

## Turing Story Machine

```
**DESCRIPTION**

An abstract machine for generating stories.

**COMPONENTS**

A TAPE made of one or more CELLs (4-10 suggested), stores the fiction.

Each CELL (= index card), stores (=write down) a single story ELEMENT (character, location, etc). 

STATE (= token) is the current focus of the story. Can be set equal to (=place on) the ELEMENT in any CELL or BLANK, which is the empty ELEMENT.

HEAD (= token) is the narrator, always (placed) on a CELL, can perform the following OPERATIONS on that CELL: 

WRITE; change the CELL ELEMENT based on the STATE, narrate this transformation, set the STATE to BLANK. Writing to a BLANK CELL introduces a new ELEMENT to the story in that CELL. If the STATE is BLANK this is arbitrary. If you write a BLANK STATE to a CELL with a ELEMENT which is not BLANK, narrate an epilogue for this ELEMENT, set the CELL to BLANK.

READ; set the STATE to the CELL ELEMENT; narrate details about this ELEMENT.

MOVE; the HEAD to a new CELL, narrate thoughts, emotions or change in story direction.

**PROCEDURE**

Perform OPERATIONS with the HEAD. The TAPE and STATE begin BLANK. START with a WRITE. STOP when the TAPE is all BLANK again.

## Snitch

```
4-6 Players

One player is a cop who tries to arrest a mobster.
All other players are mobsters.

The cop rolls two four-sided die in secret for each mobster to determine how much evidence they have against each.

The cop takes a mobster into a separate room for interrogation. The other mobsters may plot together during interrogations.

The cop can disclose as much or as little information as they like and may lie.

Interrogated mobsters can:
Deny- if evidence against you is four or more, it goes up by one 

Take the fall- evidence against all other mobsters goes down by one, evidence against you goes up by three

Snitch- all evidence against you counts against a different mobster instead.

If at any time the evidence against a mobster is nine or more the cop can make an arrest.

The game ends when each mobster has been interrogated a maximum of three times or the cop makes an arrest.

If no arrest has been made the mobsters go free and they win the game

If a mobster is arrested he loses. However he can accuse another mobster of snitching on him and, if correct, the snitch loses as well.

## Hero's Council

```
Players: 4+; 1 as Story Master (SM), rest act as The Council.
Components Required: 6-sided Die (1D6)

Players represent The Council in the Hero’s mind. As the SM tells a tale, challenges will come up; The Council will have to decide how the Hero will react based upon the personalities they represent from the table below - overlap is okay. The Council must decide on two outcomes, assigning each one as either even or odd.

Once the outcomes have been assigned, The Council should discuss the options further and try to sway each other one way or another. After a few minutes, The SM will say “1, 2, 3 vote” and players will put out 1 or 2 fingers. The SM will count up the fingers determining if even or odd won and roll a 1D6 to see if the winning option succeeds. For each Council member that openly sided with the winning choice, the SM will add +1 to a die roll.

1D6                  Personality                                Outcome
1                       Self first                                     Overwhelming failure
2                       Puts others first                       Failure
3                       Money, money, money            Success
4                       Kill everything                          Success
5                       Nature is my friend                 Success
6                       Center of attention                 Success
7+                     -                                                 Overwhelming success

## Labrynith

```
You will need: 
3-6 people
A Chair
Approximately 10-feet of open space

The walls are dark yet ever changing.  You do not remember when you last saw the sun.  You cannot escape, but at least your life will be interesting.  Twice since you last ate the cloying smell of death has greeted your nose, but you could not find the bodies to scavenge for food.

Play in the dark.

One player (the ‘Hero’) is trying, and failing, to escape the Labyrinth.  All other players are the environment and hazards (the GMs).

To begin, the GMs form a circle around the Hero (seated in the chair)

The Hero will declare a direction. Whichever GM is standing closest to that direction will narrate the scene.  

The GM is trying to prompt the player to want to leave the scene.  Darkness, dampness, creeping horrors, crawling slimy things:  these are the GM’s tools.  Lean close, let the Hero feel your presence without touching.

At any time, the Hero may declare a direction to initiate a scene change, and a new GM will narrate what happens next.

Play ends once the all the GMs have had a turn, or the Hero meets an untimely fate.

## In Need

```
In order to play you’ll need two players and one six sided dice. One player is the loaner, the other is the client. 

Client: 
What does the shop look like? 
Why do you need money? 
What is the item you’re bringing? 

Roll 1d6 on the Value Table. Your item is worth this much according to you.

Value Table
1 - Worthless
2 - Cheap
3 - Common 
4 - Expensive
5 - Rare
6 - Inestimable 

Tell the story of how you acquired it. Where does it come from? What do you think it is? Why do you think it is worth that much?

Loaner:
Roll 1d6 on the Value Table. This is the real worth of the item.

You know the real story, origin and/or purpose of this item. What is it?
If the value is higher or lower than what the client rolled, explain why? 

Client: 
Decide what you do with the item.
Sell = Acquire as much as the value rolled by the loaner
Pawn = Get half of the value rolled by the loaner rounded down. 
Quit = Go back home with your item. 


How does your decision change the situation that brought you here? 

Both Players:
Switch places or end the game.

## Signed Away

```

Needs: deck of cards, paper, pens, 4+ people

You are warlocks, your souls contracted off to supernatural entities. Each player writes their name and draws the sigil of their patron at the top of their sheet of paper. Divide the rest into ten sections, in them write:
•	1 goal
•	3 ideals (+1 card each)
•	3 skills (±1 to any action)
•	3 relationships (ask GM for a piece of information once/day)
Cover three of these traits with your patron’s sigil. Covered traits (bonds) give you nothing. Each day draw number cards equal to your number of bonds + uncovered ideals. The GM draws a face card for the day’s obstacle; jack is mundane, queen is magical, king is either. Players decide on actions, then discard a card smaller than their number of bonds if helping their patron, or greater than if not. Ties succeed with a cost. If you do not or cannot succeed, cover another trait and succeed with your patron’s help. Each day consists of five actions.
Complete your goal before you are forced to sign it away and become your patron’s servant. Servants can continue to play but only act in their patron’s interests.

## Jersey Gore: a game for 4 or 6 players

```
You’re on one of them reality shows. Some guidos and Jersey girls. Some of you’s are vampires. 

You’re sitting opposite someone. Pick someone you’re into, and someone you’ve got beef with. Make sure your opposite picked one of them.

Start with one six sided die each.
 
Do whatever. Other players say how that affects them.

When your opposite is like, “Nah, you can’t just do that”, roll all your dice and check the highest:
-- 6: Boom, golden.
-- 4-5: You got it, but give someone a new die. 
-- 1-3: Sorry bro. Your opposite says what happens, and you pick up a die.

Once you’ve got 6 dice, your shit’s wrecked. Keep one, give 2 to one player next to you, 3 to the other. Your opposite gets to say what wrecked it.

Whenever someone gives you some dice, you caught some fallout. You gotta say how what they did affected you.

If you and someone smush, or they’re DTF (Down To Fang), give one of their dice to someone else.

When you take a sec with the crew and vent to the camera, lose one of your dice.

You win if your shit got wrecked fewer times than your opposite.

## The Dreamer

```
The goal of the game is to persuade the Dreamer out of their nightmare. If the Dreamer ceases to believe that you are part of the dream, you leave the dream. If they are Calm when you leave the dream, you succeed. If the Dreamer realizes they are in a dream or you run out of dice, they wake up and you remain, forever trapped inside.

You start with three six-sided Credibility Dice and the Dreamer in the Anxious state. The Dreamer has three emotional states: Frightened, Anxious, and Calm. Their state changes based on their immediate circumstances. If they are in danger, they are Frightened. If there is an impending--but not immediate--danger, they are Anxious. Once they feel safe, they become Calm. Attempting to convince the Dreamer of something extraordinary requires a dice roll. A roll of six or higher while they are Frightened or ten or higher while they are Anxious or Calm convinces them of your words. If they are Anxious and you roll under six, you unintentionally cause them to become Frightened. Rolling a four or lower at any time causes you to lose a credibility die, while rolling a twelve or higher gains you one.
