# Downloads

## 2015 Challenge

Thanks to some hard work from [Rickard Elimää](https://plus.google.com/u/0/116235159947041206206/posts), you can download all of the entries in [this handy-dandy PDF](http://schirduans.com/david/Files/200WordCompendium.pdf)!

_(It’s pretty big, so you may want right click –> save as)_

## 2016 Challenge

Originally sold for charity, the PDF can be **[downloaded here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B80n8S8QrXvYdjZ1TjdYa2ZZcFk/view?usp=sharing)** for free!

## Download Everything

if the PDF is too constraining, this entire website and all of the entries hosted on it can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/200WordRPG/200wordrpg.github.io). _(the little green button in the top right)_

All of the entries can be found in the **_posts** folder. 2016 entries have the title _00-00-2016_ while the 2017 entries have _2017_ in their title.
