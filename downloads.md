## Download Everything

if the PDF is too constraining, this entire website and all of the entries hosted on it can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/200WordRPG/200wordrpg.github.io). _(the little green button in the top right)_

All of the entries can be found in the **_posts_** folder. The dates of each entry are in the filename, so you can sort by which challenge is which.
