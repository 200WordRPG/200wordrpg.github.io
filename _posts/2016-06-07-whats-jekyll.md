<p class="lead"> <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes.</p>

From [the project's readme](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
