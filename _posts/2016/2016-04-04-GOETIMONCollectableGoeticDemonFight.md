For two players. You are sorcerers fighting to impress King Solomon.

Each player picks Wizard Traits:
Wizard Name
Fantasy Nation
Magical Tool

SORCERERS HAVE 4 DEVILS EACH:

DEVILS HAVE 3 TRAITS. ROLL 1D6 FOR EACH CHART TO DETERMINE THEM:
Element
1-2: Brimstone
3-4: Vitriol
5-6: Hellfire

Weapon
1-2: Horns
3-4: Hooves
5-6: Scales

Title
1-2: King
3-4: Duke
5-6: Usurper

DEVIL NAME: [Title] [Abbreviation from the Periodic Table of Elements][+ “iel” or “mon”]

WRITE EACH DEVIL ON A SEPARATE INDEX CARD

TO FIGHT: Sorcerers shuffle their devils into separate decks, face down. Each turn both sorcerers flip one devil over and compare traits.

BRIMSTONE beats VITRIOL beats HELLFIRE beats BRIMSTONE
HORNS beat HOOVES beat SCALE beats HORNS
KING beats DUKE beats USURPER beats KING

When a trait BEATS another trait, it’s worth 1d6. 
COMPILE d6’s. ROLL:
1-3: NOTHING
4-6: REMOVE ENEMY DEVIL TRAIT

A sorcerer may cast one spell (before rolling) at the cost of 1 Wizard Trait:
Bargain: 6’s remove 2 enemy devil traits.
Hex: 1’s restore an enemy devil trait.
Sacrifice: Cancel spell.

SPELLS AFFECT BOTH SORCERERS.

AFTER ONE ATTACK SURVIVING DEMONS RETURN TO DECKS.

A DEVIL WITH NO TRAITS IS UNSUMMONED.

A SORCERER WITH NO DEVILS IS DEAD.
