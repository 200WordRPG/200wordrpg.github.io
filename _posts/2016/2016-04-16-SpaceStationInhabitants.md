                       SPACE STATION INHABITANTS
                      ___________________________


    For the [200 Word RPG Supplement Challenge 2016].
    <http://schirduans.com/david/200-word-rpg-challenge-2016>


Start with the first table. Roll one die. On a 5, move one column to the
left. On a 6 move right. Never change direction or leave the table: Use
row 5/6 instead. Else select the row for the number you rolled.

Go to the next table. Start with the row for the last number you
rolled. Roll again. 5 moves up, 6 moves down, never turn around. The
number gives the column. The last column is special: It never applies to
the job rolled in the first table.

## Author Comments (if any)

Deepest Respect for making this challenge Open Access! It is wonderful to see good licensing practice to spread in Roleplaying Games! (though I would prefer sharealike licensing). And please use a fixed-width font when you use plain text entries :) (if you need a pdf, I can export that easily)
