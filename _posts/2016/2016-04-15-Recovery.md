Life is a constant battle between you and your addiction.
 
Answer the following:
What is your name and addiction?
Who have you hurt? How?
 
Shuffle a Joker into the bottom half of a 52-card deck.
 
Take turns framing scenes from your character’s life. A successful scene of making amends adds 1 Recovery or removes 2 Stress. A scene of overindulgence clears all Stress but costs 1 Recovery. Other players may introduce obstacles by drawing a card and applying its effects to themselves.
 
When obstacles cause disagreements, the scene-framer rolls their dice-pool. Dice showing 5 or 6 are successes. One or more successes allow the scene-framer to narrate the outcome, otherwise the interjector does.
 
The scene-framer’s dice-pool begins at 0. Add 1d6 for every card they choose to draw (maximum 5). Remove 1d6 for every 2 Stress they have. Roll first, then draw, resolve and discard cards.
 
Card Effects:
A– +2 Stress
KQJ– +1 Stress
Joker– +3 Stress, remake deck
 
The game ends when the number of Jokers drawn equals the number of players minus one. Players narrate an epilogue based on their Recovery score: highest makes significant recovery progress, middle makes progress but faces setbacks, lowest suffers a painful relapse.

## Judge Comments

The rules here are crunchy, but it makes perfect sense. Recovering from addiction forces people to balance hard decisions. Harsh but compelling subject with thematic implementation. - [_Sarah Judd_]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)
