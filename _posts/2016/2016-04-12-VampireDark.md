Vampire Dark

A supplement for Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley

The Sabbat embraced us en masse and buried us together. Who will survive?

Choose a city. Put a single piece of A4 paper in the middle of the table â€“ horizontally for a SHALLOW GRAVE; vertically for a DEEP GRAVE.

Write a name and clan for your vampire on a post-it. Highest result on a six-sided die chooses their position in the grave first.

Will you RUN AWAY, TEAM-UP or ATTACK?

Roll one die if it is within human capabilities.
Add a die if it is within the expertise of your clan.
Roll a RED die if you are willing to risk FRENZY.

Your highest die shows how well you do. Any player that matches the result of your RED die on a single die of their own may describe a sickening and heinous act taken by your character during FRENZY. 

Will you support the SABBAT, the CAMARILLA or the populace of the CITY?

Everyone who is cooperating rolls their dice; the highest result determines the result for the pack. Highest result determines the winner between competing interests.

If we are the sickness then what is the cure?

## Author Comments (if any)

This supplement relies on (a) the system of Cthulhu Dark, which it adapts to particular purpose, and (b) the themes and cultural presence of Vampire: The Masquerade, a role-playing game first released by White Wolf in 1991.

## Judge Comments
Again, there's that Vampire-horror, this time blended with Cthulhu Dark. Good pick for system for this setting. - [_Stephanie Bryant_]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)
