The crew seems mutinous. Possible confederates gather to plot, but some may need to be persuaded, or could be loyal and might rat out the ringleaders. 

Pirate have five attributes (Cunning, Dueling ,Leadership, Notoriety, Luck) with an assigned die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12) that they roll when used. All attributes start at d8. Players raise dice a step by lowering another attribute. So to be a d12, one attribute must be a d4 or two must be d6s.

Pirates have a Disposition (Loyal, Satisfied, Neutral, Dissatisfied, Mutinous), starting at Neutral. Moving towards Satisfied or Loyal lowers one or two dice, towards Dissatisfied or Mutinous raises one or two dice.

Pirates use attributes to change others’ minds (by wits, force, personality, threats). They roll opposing dice, revealing information about their Disposition. Highest result wins, lowering the loser’s die once. Tie causes a Luck roll; an additional tie has no effect. Loser may roll Luck against the winning number. Success means no lowering, tie or failure means both attributes lower. If any d4 is lowered, the Player changes Disposition once in direction of winner’s choice.

Convince others to mutiny or stay loyal without revealing your intentions.Who knows who is listening...
