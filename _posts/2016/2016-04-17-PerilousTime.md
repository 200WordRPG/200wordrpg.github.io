Perilous Time
By Darrell Thomas

You are in grave danger and time is not on your side. 

Pick a genre and a dangerous situation to be in. Your character can be anything you want. All characters have six D6. Five of your D6 go into a community pool. Keep one for your personal pool.

To attempt actions, place a D6 from the community pool into your personal pool. Roll 2D6 from your personal pool, add the results, and subtract the number of unrolled dice from your personal pool. If the result is a 1,2,or 3, place another die from the community pool into your personal pool. The action took more time. If the result is a 10,11,or 12, place a D6 from your personal pool back in the community pool. The action took less time. If the result is a negative number, place two dice from the community pool into your personal pool. The action took a lot of time. For other results, a normal amount of time passes.

Play until you beat the dangerous situation or there arenâ€™t any dice left in the community pool. When the community pool runs out, the danger defeats you.
