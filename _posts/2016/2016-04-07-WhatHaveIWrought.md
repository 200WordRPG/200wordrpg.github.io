```
You are a mad scientist. You are a week away from completing New Technology that will give you the power to control time, and you can’t help but envision what your new life will be like. For the next week, imagine when and how you would use your new power in your life, and write these things down in your Notes.

At the end of the week, you have completed your invention. Review your Notes from the week. Will this make you a hero, a villain, or something else entirely? Do you use your New Technology, or do you destroy it?

If you decide to use it, destroy your Notes. You have the real thing now.

If you destroy it, keep your Notes in a safe place, as a reminder.

If you want, you may create another New Technology that will give you a different power and follow the steps above as many times as you’d like.
