“Rule 1-2-3” RPG mechanic system
By Tim Snider

This is a simple “target-number” mechanic that can be used on the fly as needed or to introduce very young players to dice-rolling mechanics. There’s only one rule:

1s, 2s, and 3s are ALWAYS successes.

Everyone uses a 4-sided die, 6-sided die, and 12-sided die. For any action, the GM assesses the difficulty of the task as Easy, Average, or Difficult.

Easy tasks would be remembering a phone number you were told 5 minutes ago, punching someone while they're asleep, or parking a car at the mall.

Average tasks would be remembering a phone number you were told last month, punching someone you're fighting with, or parallel parking a car during downtown rush hour.

Difficult tasks would be remembering a phone number you were told 5 years ago, punching someone who's currently shooting at you, or parking a car while blindfolded.

For an Easy Task, the player rolls the d4. A 1-2-3 is a success. (A 75% probability.)

For an Average Task, the player rolls the d6. A 1-2-3 is a success. (A 50% probability.)

For a Difficult task, the player rolls the d12. A 1-2-3 is a success. (A 25% probability.)

I've actually been looking for a ridiculously simple dice mechanic for a while that still offers something interesting to play with, and this works for me. I'd like to see it developed a little bit to see skills, traits or character stuff worked in (and the examples are a little screwy - remembering a phone number from 5 years ago, I'd argue, is a near-impossible task) but it's a solid core for running a game when you're drunk, and I like that. - [_Grant Howitt_]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)
