This is an inspiration aid for heroic challenges for  “Apple of Discord” or any other mythic game.

Mission:
The double that initiates the challenge dictates the type of task the Hero needs to perform:


Double
Mission
1
Rescue
2
Slay
3
Steal
4
Conquer
5
Sail
6
Escape
Blank
Sacrifice

Defining Element:

The other sides of the first and second pieces added to the challenge combine to identify an element, person, goal or site that play an important role in the challenge. There are no blanks; such dangerous events are too dramatic to be left to random chance and should reflect the Hero traits and Gods involved.
