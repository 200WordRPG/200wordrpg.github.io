The Lost Cellar provides a nifty way of creating a random path to Baron Niln’s store of wine. By cross-referencing a random sentence with you table of landmarks, it produces a thematically consistent and reasonably variable cellar that could be the entirety of an adventure all on its own. - [_Marshall Miller_]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)
