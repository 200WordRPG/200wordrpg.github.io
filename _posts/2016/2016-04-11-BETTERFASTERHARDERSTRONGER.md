## Author Comments (if any)

No matter the genre, be it sci-fi, fantasy, super heroes, noir detective stories, fighting anime, or gritty modern day thrillers. I've always loved action movies, and one of the best things about them is that supremely sweet payoff of the final fight scene.  I wanted to make a game that you can use to kill 20 minutes and have that knock down, drag out, no-holds-barred romp without the weighty rules set or any of the baggage of trying to stat out every little thing.  

Play and let the fight get more and more ridiculous and desperate as time goes on.  Have fun and keep playing with the same characters or switch things up.  Above all, enjoy!
