SET UP

(d6 = six-sided die)

You are a HERO of MILLENNIUM CITY.

Choose a superpower. Create a cool name. 

Create your secret/mundane life. Pick a job. Pick hobbies. 

Create 1-6 important people in your mundane life. Create backstories. 

RULES

Choose a number of rounds to play. 

The GM creates a DANGER to the city. (Disaster, supervillain, etc.) 

You or the GM creates an important PERSONAL event that happens at the same time as the DANGER. (Wedding, graduation, birthday, etc.) 

Choose one: save the city or be there for your loved ones. 

Narrate or roleplay your chosen victory. The GM narrates or roleplays the event you ignored.

Be a TRUE HERO: choose a number and roll a d6. If you get it, you can succeed at both. If you don't, you fail at both. 

Play until the end. Narrate an epilogue. 


OPTIONAL RULES

RANDOMIZE: Roll 2d6. One represents DANGER, the other PERSONAL. The number determines the severity of each. 

TRACKS: Create a track for failures for DANGER and PERSONAL. When the track fills up you quit or become a villain. 

GROUP: Send heroes to deal with each other's PERSONALS and DANGERS. Use powers wisely and creatively. Join forces. Have fun.
