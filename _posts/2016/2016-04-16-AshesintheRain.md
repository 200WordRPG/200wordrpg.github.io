AitR is a game for two players: a Sender and an Addressee; you will need three sheets of paper, a pencil, a lighter and a rainy day to play it.
The Sender should sit at a table or on the ground turning his/her back to a window, while the Addressee should stay in front of the window and watch outside.
The Sender starts telling an episode of his/her character’s life, while writing the most important parts in letter form. He/she should express hope while answering to one question per scene:
-Where will you meet again?
-What do you want to achieve together?
-Why will you keep in touch against all odds?
At the end of each scene the Sender will give the letter to the Addressee without looking directly at his/her face.
The Addressee’s scenes take place after receiving the last letter and should express sadness and loss while answering to one question:
-Why didn’t you meet?
-Why did you fail?
-What made you fall apart?
Repeat this sequence three times..
The Addressee burns the letters at the end of his/her third scene and blows the ashes in the rain outside the window.
