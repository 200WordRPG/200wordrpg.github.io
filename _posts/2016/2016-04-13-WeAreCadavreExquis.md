## Author Comments (if any)

(This replaces my prior submission April 4 of We Are Character...) Comments were as before, something like: "Thanks to all the inspiring gamers I've played with, including those at Strategicon, GoPlayNW, Girl Gamer Gathering, Big Bad Con, from Story Games Seattle / Olympia."
