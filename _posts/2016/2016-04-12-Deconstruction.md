Arrange the words as a crossword puzzle.

Anyone may choose any one word about which to speak.

Why did the word survive its culture?
When did its meaning change?
What does the word betray or subvert about the culture that made the word?

Morris Swadesh published an intermediary version of the Salish language in 1952. It was exactly 200 words. Words are not made of science, or of God, or of the things they describe. Words are made of other words.

Philosopher Jacques Derrida is commonly understood to be the progenitor of deconstruction - but as he said, it is the reading rather than the writing of an idea that is important.

## Judge Comments
Deconstruction is a fascinating rpg. It's exploring the power of words. I love using words and misunderstandings of them and how that shapes a culture as a world-building concept. I haven't seen anything like it. - [_Sarah Judd_]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)

Would play - scrabble pieces are tangibly fun. teaches an element of worldbuilding oft forgotten. deliberate mispronunciations = easy enjoyment. accessible to many age groups/backgrounds. - [_Kat Kuhl_]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)
