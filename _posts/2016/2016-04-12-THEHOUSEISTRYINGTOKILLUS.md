```
SETUP:
Gather Poltergeist (ref) and 3-4 Victims.
 
Begin in room with EXIT door.
 
Each Player writes three HAZARDS (ways room could kill you) on front of three index cards. (Ex: Falling Chandelier).
 
Poltergeist divides Hazards into 3 even randomized text-down piles and writes a SAFE word (STOP, DODGE, or RUN) on back of each
 
Shuffle together, Hazard side up. Leave deck in room.
 
Repeat in next two rooms moving away from Exit.
 
PLAY:
 
Each player's turn, Poltergeist draws three cards at random from the room’s deck.
 
Taking turns, Victims walk cautiously across the room until Poltergeist says “DANGER!” and narrates one of the Hazards in hand.
 
Victim decides to STOP, DODGE, or RUN.  

Poltergeist checks Safe word, narrates result:
If STOP is correctly chosen, Victim takes another turn. Incorrect: Narrate Wound, end turn.
If DODGE is correct, flip coin... HEADS- take another turn; TAILS- next closest player takes Wound, end turn. Incorrect: Narrate Wound, end turn.
If RUN is correct, Take 3 more steps, end turn. Incorrect: Flip coin... HEADS-Fall back two steps, end turn; TAILS: Narrate Wound, end turn.

Turn Ends= discard used hazards, reshuffle unused.  
Five Wounds= incapacitated/dead
Cross threshold= use next room’s deck
Exit = Survival!

## Author Comments (if any)

Add ambience with low lighting, scary music, and wearable red "Wound" markers.
