One in Six (4 players, 30 minutes)

A light bulb illuminates a table. A six shooter loaded with a single bullet lies on the tabletop. The rules are simple. Pull the trigger, survive, ask three questions, pass on the gun.


Preparation

Seperate cards into two piles. One pile should contain Role Cards, the other Roulette Cards. Shuffle the Role Cards, then have each player draw one (keeping the Role a secret to other players) and fill in the blanks. 

Spin a writing utensil on the table to pick who goes first.


Taking Turns

Shuffle all Roulette Cards, then draw. If it's a Click Card, you ask anyone three questions to which answers are made up. Every answer is considered truth. 

If you draw a Blam! Card, you're dead. 

Play continues clockwise. Repeat until there is only one live player.


Goal

Find the answer to your Role Card's question and survive.

## Author Comments (if any)

One in Six is meant to get players to come up with an exciting crime story collaboratively while putting a timer on the player's input. Who knows? You could be dead as soon as you put that gun in your hand.
