BURN UP BAD HOUSE
A game for one

This game is a secret. Keep it close.

Draw the house where he kept you. Make it big. Label six places, like KITCHEN or BIG DOOR or UNDER THE BED.

Do this daily:

1) Light a flame
2) Pick a place
3) Remember something that happened there. Draw it. Whisper it to the flame
4) Do you feel something? Something real? If you don’t, skip to step 6
5) Cut out the place. Burn it
6) Blow out the flame. Hide the house under your pillow.

If you don’t burn anything for three days, burn the whole house.
If anyone else finds out about this game, burn the whole house.

When the house is all gone, stop playing.
