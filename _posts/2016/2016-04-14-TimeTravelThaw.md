```
The perfidious proprietor of peril â€“ Professor Pandemonium has traveled BACK TO THE PAST to ERASE FROM TIME the superhero team that has prevented her previous plots of pugnacity. Only our heroes can rescue themselves by following the precocious professor BACK IN TIME and stopping her pernicious plans.

Players write down 3 powers on a shared piece of paper towel. Use colored markers to distinguish between heroes. Make sure to spread them out across the paper towel. Assign a point value of 2, 3, or 4 to each power (example: perfect hair-2, scent of vanilla-3, instant sunburn-4).

Players must roll a power's point value or better on a six-sided die to succeed in the use of a power. Actions not associated with a power need a 6 to succeed.

Place the paper towel on a plate, and an ice cube on the paper towel. As the ice melts, powers that get wet are ERASED FROM TIME and no longer work. If a hero loses all their powers, they are LOST FOR ALL ETERNITY.

A 5x10 inch piece of paper towel will take about 30 minutes to soak through. Adjust the paper towel size as needed.

Pretty much inspired by things like Back to the Future... even if I haven't watched one of those in many years.

I loved this mechanic of melting ice! Depending on where you live, this might be a very fast game, as you quickly run out of powers a desert climate! - [_Stephanie Bryant_]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)

Time Travel Thaw has a really innovative theme - the idea that ice is melting and wiping out what makes you you due to wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff. I'm not sure how well it would work in play, but the introduction of an uncertain element to the game both lends urgency and keeps the one-shot game from spiralling out of control. I'd love to run this and amp up the enthusiasm of the players around the table. - [_Grant Howitt_]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)
