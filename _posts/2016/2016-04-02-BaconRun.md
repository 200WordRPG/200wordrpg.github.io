You're a group of anthropomorphic pigs dumped on an island, being chased by anthropomorphic wolf hunters - who want to kill and eat you - through a variety of areas. Best part. This is entertainment for the world to watch.

Character Creation
You have a job. Write it down and tell everyone.
You have a hobby. Write it down and tell everyone.
You have a reason to live. Write it down. Tell us why it's your reason to live.

Playing the Game
Player who last ate bacon describes the first location.

Everyone rolls a d6. Low roll narrates how they die. If low rolls are tied they re-roll. New low roll dies.

Players can re-roll once per scene by describing how their job, hobby, or reason helps them live. Then cross it out. It can't be used to re-roll again.

Once a pig is dead the scene is over. Begin a new scene.

Players of dead pigs become wolf hunters. Once per scene a hunter can make any pig re-roll by describing a trap they laid for them. If that causes the pig to die the hunter gets to describe the pigs death.

Play continues until one pig is left.
