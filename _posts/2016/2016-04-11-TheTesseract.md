Folks play games with dice. Some even tell stories with’m, though I’ve ne’er.

Gods invent worlds the same way, only their dice ’re... more.

How d’ I know? Y’ ever lose a die in th’ middle of a game? Happened to th’ Gods, yar, ‘n’ it landed in this realm!

The DTesseract. A hypercube, four dimensions! This ‘n fell inta our world, and it still has its power.

I dunno if th’ Gods’ve noticed, but I’ve. A warrior in drab armour rolled it on th’ ground, as an army of orcs came at him! (rogue I am, I ‘uz hidin’ nearby) I swear I sawr eight of it tumble inside each oth’r, ‘n’ eight numbers shone up.

Th’ armour got all... y’ ever seen a di’mon’, uh, refract? Buncha colours comin’ from one? Th’ armour did tha’, yar. Th’ orcs couldn’t do jack! If a chink appeared in one colour, another’d cover it! Truth be tol’ I sawr a weakness, yar, but if’n yer askin’, tha’ thing’s trouble. No thanks. If ‘m right, tha’s 6x8, so, more’n twenty things’t could’ve happened, no doubt some’re nasty.

Nay, folks like me, we’re n’t meant t’ play god. A hero like you, though...

## Author Comments (if any)

A tesseract is also called an 8-cell, because it is comprised of eight cubes, folded in 4D. Like the narrator says, there are 48 (that's more than 20!) permutations of 8d6, as long as each die's position matters. To use this, one might want to make a table with each permutation corresponding to a random event. Or, 48 events is a lot of events, maybe the consequences should simply follow whatever the narrative requires...
