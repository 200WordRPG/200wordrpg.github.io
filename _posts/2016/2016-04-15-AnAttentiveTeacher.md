## Author Comments (if any)

In real life, I teach children how to read and interpret literature. Yet despite reading many different game systems, I’ve yet to come across any that actually simulate the learning experience itself. 

This supplement seeks to redeem that.

At its basest level, the learning process follows:
—understand
—apply
—synthesise

In order to enact the synthesis process, any skill must be deemed to be made up of at least two simpler skills; i.e. two-weapon fighting is largely about shaping the follow-through of your weapon and learning to move with the whole body.

One of the sub-skills is modelled so that the student can observe its correct practice. Ask the student what aspects of the modelled behaviour they are paying particular attention to: encourage them to ask whatever questions they deem necessary. If their questions and observations are particularly attentive, reward them with bonuses to the skill check to understand (if you wish to call for this).

After observing, the student gains the opportunity to apply the skill. Consider the safest way to demonstrate this skill—and solely this skill.

Once this process is repeated for each other sub-skill, students must synthesise each of the composite elements.

An attentive teacher provides advantage.
