The year is 2278, an age from Virgo™'s successful launch of the Global Pleasure Satellite in 2030... the reason the world ended. The Satellite crashed in Las Vegas and turned the continent into a gigantic dust bowl filled with raiders, savages and opportunists.

You play scavangers, heading out to find treasures in the forgotten desert lands using the huge satellite city as your home base. 

Roll 3D6 for the following stats:

Charisma
Muscle
Agility
Smarts

you can assign the rolls how you want to each stat if you have a specific character in mind.


The GM will choose a difficulty level from the table below and you'll have to roll over that with 3D6 (plus your applicable stat) in order to succeed a roll.

Easy
15
Tricky
20
Hard
25
Don't Bother
30


All Ricochet scavenger teams have a BEAST (armoured car). Pick a perk from below for your BEAST.

Tank – gain +3 to defense rolls in the BEAST, -3 to agility rolls.

Nitro – Your BEAST goes dangerously fast +3 to agility rolls, -3 to defense rolls.

Voodoo Fetish – swaps the rolls of an enemy and a PC – also incurs a story event (GM choice)
