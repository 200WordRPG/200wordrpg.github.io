No loot, no problem

EACH
What…?
  is your speciality
  is your temperament
  mutation made you an outcast
  is your space pirate nickname
  technological artifact, weird place, relationship links you to your table neighbours
Why should you be captain?

TOGETHER
What is your spacecraft’s…?
  special weapon
  weakness
  name

Elect the captain

ROUND
Tell something (event, your action, ambiance...) related to the current chapter.
Roll a dice, the previous player interprets an unexpected:
    1-2: problem (spotted, malfunction, mutation triggered, hurt, misunderstanding…)
    5-6: advantage (ally, tool, secret, knowledge, position, luck…)
The next player takes his turn.

Change chapter when you wish.

Chapters:
A - The target you found (cover, type, design, defence, potential booty, activity, location…)
B - The way you board the target (violently, stealthy, deception…) 
C - How you loot and what (approach, recovery, carriage…)
D - Roll a dice:
   1: The target’s boss and his team intervene
   2: The loot is not what it seemed and is a threat
   3: One of you is a traitor and triggers his trap
   4: A space horror has colonized the target and attacks
   5: The space authorities board the spaceship
   6:  The target will be destroyed soon
E - How you survive
F - What you have learned

Arrr!
