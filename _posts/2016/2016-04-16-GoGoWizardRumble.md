Go Go Wizard Rumble

You and your opponent are wizards. That’s one wizard too many! The aim of the game is to reduce your opponent’s health down to zero by casting SPELLS. 

You have six SPELLS:

RAISE DEAD (clenched fist)
FIREBALL (middle finger)
LIGHTNING (two fingers, like a pistol)
WARPHOLE (circle with thumb and index finger)
SUMMON FAMILIAR (sock puppet/lizard shape with hand)
DEFLECT MAGIC (open palm)

You each start with 5HP.

PLAY

Face your opponent with both your fists clenched opposite each other.

Count “one, two, three” then cast a SPELL with each hands:

DEFLECT MAGIC blocks a spell. The same spells cancel each other out (except FIREBALL VS FIREBALL see below).

All other spells HIT and deal 1HP.

The same spell (except DEFLECT MAGIC) cast with both hands overrides any DEFLECT MAGIC, if both players do this however some DANGEROUS SORCERY has happened and you are both dealt damage.

Magic is dangerous, sometimes ODD THINGS happen:

LIGHTNING VS WARPHOLE = TIME RUSH only count to 2 next round.
RAISE DEAD VS SUMMON FAMILIAR = BEASTIE BIT ME one hand each next round
FIREBALL VS FIREBALL = WE’RE BOTH ON FIRE! Double Damage next round

```
