Judge Horrific Tone

Requirements:
1 GM, 3 intense but respectful players, 1 timer, 1 hour, 13 index cards with a Tone written on each:

Cold
Creepy
Depressing
Foreboding
Gory
Gritty
Hyperbolic
Humor
Morbid
Raging
Subtle
Suppressed
Suspense

Strangers Carly, Tai, and Stacy are staying the night in a motel by a lake.

Players, take 3 secret Tones apiece and write the name of one player (including yourself) on each.

GM, frame each scene in under a minute. Be curt and obvious. Always “Yes, And”.

1 minute: Did you want to stop here?
2: Does the deer hurt you?
1: Do you successfully call the police?
3: Are you locked out?
1: Do you have a weapon?
4: Do you hurt anyone?
1: Are you calm?
5: Do you escape the motel?
1: Did you live?

When time runs out:
“Which of your Tones best matches Carly’s portrayal? Point to that player. Tai? Stacy?

Carly, start at 3, -1 for only being pointed at 2/3 times for her portrayal, -2 for two points during others’ portrayals.”

GM, give a one-liner addendum to the scene for each character.
3 critical success
1+ success
-1..0 failure
-6..-2 critical failure
```
