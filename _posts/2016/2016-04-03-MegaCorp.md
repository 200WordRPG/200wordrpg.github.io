You’re suits pulling the strings of a MegaCorp. But the ‘Corp is falling - you and your associates have been picking it apart for months now. You want as many assets as possible before it crashes. But not the most, nor seen to be responsible for the crash - they will be charged with fraud...

To play, gather: 2-4 players, a Scrabble set, and a Jenga tower.

Separate Scrabble vowels from consonants. Players take 5 vowels and 9 consonants each. Players make words in secret (minimum 3 letters). Oldest player begins.

Players have a conversation - when asked a question, answer it - attempting to goad the other players into saying one or more of their words.

When a word is said, the player who owns it immediately halts play, reveals it, and replaces the letters. They draw new letters of the same amount, then either remove or replace Jenga pieces up to the amount of letters in the word (minimum 1). They then restart the conversation.

The game ends when the Jenga tower falls, and the knocker loses. The player with the most Jenga pieces loses hardest. Whoever has the second most pieces wins.

Lather everything in Cyberpunk and describe it.

## Author Comments (if any)

This game was inspired by several things: the TV show "House of Cards", and the roleplaying games "Shadowrun" and "Dread".
