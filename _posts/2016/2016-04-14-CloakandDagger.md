You and some acquaintances have gathered in the parlor and hear a strange recording. One of you has arranged a macabre game of Twenty Questions--and one of you has a secret beyond that unlocked door they’d kill to keep!

Goals:

Players--Implicate your Enemy!

Mastermind--Kill Everyone!

Actions:

Converse: Both gain 1 San.

Accuse:Lose 1 San, they lose 1 Inn.

Outburst: Lose 2 Inn, leave the parlour for 1 turn, everyone else loses 1 San. 

Investigate: Leave the parlour, gain 2 Inn.

Attack: Opposed d10 roll, loser dies. Lose 3 Inn. if you attack in the parlour.
At start, all players have 5 points in both stats + 5 to distribute. Enemies selected randomly. 


In addition to normal Actions, the Mastermind may Dim The Lights at end of turn.

By Crook: 1 player is thrown into the manor for 2 turns.

By Hook: A Trap activates, target rolls d10 under lowest stat or die.
Game ends when door opens, either by player at 0 San (opener loses 3 Inn.), or by choice (must be announced previous turn). Player with lowest Inn. has their secret revealed--that player’s Enemy (if alive) wins!
