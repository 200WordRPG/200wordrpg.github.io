Rock Gods: Go Big, or Die Hard

To create your assortment of Rock Gods you fill out a series of basic questions

What is your name?
What do you do in the band?
Who are your three best friends?
What's your problem?
What are your dreams?

Band Member Stats

Stillness (Inner Peace) - Can be harmed when things are going poorly for you, and you're the reason for it.
Hope (Resisting Despair) - Can be harmed when things are going poorly, and you have no control over it.
Dream (Wild Emotion) - Can be harmed when your dreams begin to collapse around you
Stardom (Your pure unadulterated Star Power) - Can be harmed when you start to lose fans or the fame goes to your head. 
Pull (Your influence) - Can be harmed when you start making big pushes in the company, becoming independent.

Each stat starts at 5, whenever you partake in an action that could harm any of these, you roll a d6, trying to get under it. If you roll over, you lose 1 in that stat. When you hit 0 in ANY your character is taken out of play.
