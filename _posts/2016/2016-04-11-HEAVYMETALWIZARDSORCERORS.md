```
In the magical world of Heavy Metal, legendary hardcore Rockers struggle against the evil hordes of Pop, spell after spell.
 
Think of a badass stage name and a short description of what you look like when beheld by mortal eyes.
 
Write under your name, in a column, the following 13 Holy Words of Metal:
 
Fire
Sword
Ice
Crown
Steel
Gold
Blood
Time
Space
Death
Dragon
Thunder
(and a 13th word you can make up)
 
Assign to each a number between 1 and 4 so that they all add up to 25.
 
Every time your Rocker wants to cast a spell, string three Words in a phrase that sounds like the title of a metal song (“I cast Blood of the Death Dragon!”), add their scores and roll that many d6s. If you rolled at least a 6, the spell succeeds. In a conflict against other Rockers (or Popstars!), whoever rolls more 6s wins and gets to decide what happens.
 
The effect of the spell must be related to the three words used. The Master of Metal (the GM) can veto a spell that makes no sense (“uncool”).
 
If you roll three 6s, airguitar and increase one Word’s score by 1.
```

I picked this because after reading through over 80 entries, it was one of the ones that completely stuck out in my mind as "I want to play this!"  - [_Stephanie Bryant_]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)
