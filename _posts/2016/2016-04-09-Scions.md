Pick an Eternal, 2 tags from your Eternal, one from another, and an inability from any Eternal. Name an item, unique and puissant. Succeed in conflict at a cost of three dice. 

Setup
GM
Provide a pool of 30 dice.
Each player creates a place with needs. You too.
Gives an Eternal’s secret task to each Scion.

Conflict
When a scion might fail, they roll 2 from the pool and one tag. 4+ succeeds. GM Sets Difficulties. Players may loan 1 die, but are at -1 next roll.
When in conflict with Chaos, the GM announces a cost of failure between 1 and 3 dice removed from the pool.
In pvp, cost is 2 dice.
Scion death is reversed by Eternals.
Play ends with an empty pool and player vignettes. Uncompleted Eternal tasks = chaos reigns.
