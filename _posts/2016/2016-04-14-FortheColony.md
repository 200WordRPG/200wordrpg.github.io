```
Players except GM represent mice struggling to save their mouse colony.

##Mouse divisions
Every mouse fits into following divisions:

###Harvester
Knows, which food is poisoned, revives energy or heals wounds.

###Scout
Knows the wilderness, secret corners and safe paths.

###Fighter
Knows weak spots of enemies, abounds endurance and power.

###Diplomatist
Understands, convices and outwits anybody.

##Turn
When requested, mouse on turn rolls 1d6s (up to 3 times) and may call action for every roll higher than 1 (and equal or higher than previous roll on this turn). Othrewise its turn ends. 
While calling action related to its division, mouse can re-roll a die and apply second result.

##Actions

###Movement
Maximum 2 meters on the ground or 1 meter by climbing, swimming or crawling.

###Interaction
Moving levers, biting cables, calling comrades...

###Battle
Mouse and target roll a die and substract from result a point for every trouble they suffer.
Loser gets new trouble set by GM (even already owned).

##Troubles
Every mouse can be troubled by hunger, disease, wound or exhaustion.
Mouse throws a dice less for every trouble it suffers from. If mouse doesn't have a die to throw with, it cannot continue its mission and has to rest.

## Author Comments (if any)

Although this game is strongly inspired by Mouse Guard (by theme), it comes with its own push-your-luck dice mechanics and easy to understand system of troubles.
That make For the Colony an ideal introductory system for children or people untouched by roleplaying games.
Save your friends! Work together! Get the cheese! For the Colony!
