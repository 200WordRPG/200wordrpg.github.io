Things: 3-4 players, notecards, hands

Hypercompetent: Each player writes 4 radical Occupations (e.g., samurai, neurosurgeon, astronaut.) Shuffle [Occupation] cards. 

Nonsense: Each player writes 2 silly Crimes (e.g., steal Dollywood, delete the alphabet). Shuffle [Crime] cards. 

Intro: “You are all [Occupation], sworn to battle CrimeCo International. Bangarang’s been captured! Time to get to work.”

Montage: Each player draws 2 [Occupation] and adds those to their character. Introduce the team in a cool montage sequence: show off their skills and give them names!

Turn Order: Pick a player to Lead. They narrate the scene and the opposition. The Leader draws a [Crime] - that’s CrimeCo’s goal. The other players narrate their characters Crime-fighting actions!

Resolution: When the scene reaches a climax, the Lead player and the player to their right battle best-of-3 Rock, Paper, Scissors. Narrate each success, failure and stalemate. Should stalemates “win”, the player to the Leader’s left Interferes; drawing an [Occupation] and [Crime] and describing the new Interference. End the Scene; play order rotates. 

Scenes:
1. Accidental Encounter with CrimeCo!
2. CrimeCo Does Crime to Prepare for Crime!
3. Final Crime..?

Showdown!: Rescue Bangarang and Montage your victory!

Sequel: Title Bangarang’s next adventure. Reuse your best cards!

## Author Comments (if any)

Welcome to my love letter to the bizarre cult movie, "Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, in which the hero is a country star/neurosurgeon/samurai/experimental vehicle pilot. I may be forgetting one or two. The mechanics were inspired by Wheel Tree Press' Time Cellist and Grant Howitt's Doctor Magnethands. I hope you enjoy this game of hyper-competent nonsense.

## Judge Comments

Bangarang comes at you fast -- you can feel the urgency and excitement in rules! The game has a really clear procedure, leading you through the three scenes and straight to the Showdown without putting any speed bumps in your way! I love the silly, over-the-top premise and scenes are just perfect the genre. - [_Marshall Miller_]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)
