LIFEBOAT
Thanks: Hitchcock

4+ players (1 Enemy Submariner)





We escaped our sinking civilian ship. Our Navy retaliated - destroyed the submarine. 
Now we float, lost…






We saved an enemy. They’ll navigate this lifeboat - if we trust them. 
Otherwise we’ll just drift.










CHARACTER-PROMPTS
Keep character details to yourself, at least at first.
13 card deck. Just hearts. 1 each except Submariner.

2-6                   Working Class
7*-10               Middle
J-A(11-14)      Upper

*You speak the enemy's language. Will you translate?




Introduce characters when pulled aboard, one-by-one. 
Submariner: You're (secretly?) submarine commander and fluent in your enemy’s language.





CONFLICT
Highest wins.  Reshuffle/redeal used cards.  

Challenge someone's action/assertion.  
They back down or demand to show cards.
Anyone can add their card to help.
Highest card breaks ties.
If no-one stops you, you do it.



If there’s a vote, use cards. 

Eventually we'll vote for Outcome:

**After first Outcome Vote, discard 2 from deck+roll D20.
Repeat every 10min.
If deck runs out, vote one person off each time.**



            a)Drift(20=Success)



            b)Submariner navigates(15-20=Success)


Success=We’re found! 

SUBMARINER:Did you navigate us to your territory? Arrest any of them.

Otherwise, we vote whether Submariner’s arrested on arrival, even if they helped.
