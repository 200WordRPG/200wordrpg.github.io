Open door, roll 1d6 and deal with result. If you survive, try another door. 

Behind sixth door, in addition, there's a stairway up to the next floor. Defeat any demons and climb it.

Next floor has one less room. Zero rooms = an exit and a happy end game.

Character Sheet-
Light: (Begins at 6, ticked down at least one after each room. At 0, game over.)
Skills: (Begins at 1. A list of things that makes you special. Is the damage you do with an attack.)
Esteem: (Begins at 1. A list of good memories. Is the damage you can take before dieing.)
Trauma: (Begins at 1. A list of bad memories. Is the damage a demon does with an attack.)

1 A light that joins yours. +1 Light.
2 A happy memory. Write it down. +1 Esteem
3 A tool. Write it down. +1 Skill.
4 A shade that drains some of your light. -1 Light
5 A bad memory. Write it down. +1 Trauma.
