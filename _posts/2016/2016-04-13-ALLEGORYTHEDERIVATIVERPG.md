ALLEGORY – THE DERIVATIVE RPG
“I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations…” -JRR Tolkien

This is a game where every movie, TV show, comic book, trope, and stereotype you know is validated. You need six note cards, a pen, and an embarrassingly large knowledge of cultural references per player.
SETUP
1.Take 6 cards each. Write 2 objects, 2 events, 2 characters. 
2.Pass 3 cards left, the other 3 right. Write what each thing symbolizes.
3.Continue passing (on, not back). These are your cards. 

GAMEPLAY 
Story happens across five acts, with various scenes as needed. 
1.The first to say “I have one” plays a card and describes what happens to him, using the symbolic element on the card as inspiration for a conflict. 
2.Players may “buy in” to the scene by playing one of their cards and doing the same, or starting a new scene in the same way. 
3.When everyone has played a card for the Act, a new Act begins in the same way, following form. 
4.Acts MUST follow this format: 
Act I – Conflict | Act II – Complications | Act III – The Twist! | Act IV – Climax | Act V – Resolution
