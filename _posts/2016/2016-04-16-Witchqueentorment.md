```
Witchqueen rests on her throne in the middle of the deepest dungeon. Every year - on the eve of the night when she made a blasphemous ritual - she rolls the dice:

1. Nothing happens
2. Nothing happens
3. Nothing happens
4. Nothing happens
5. Nothing happens
6. She rolls again

1. Something collapsed with age
2. Something broke with age
3. Something jammed with age
4. Something spoiled with age
5. Something rotted with age
6. She rolls again

1. A rodent found the entrance to the dungeon
2. An animal found the entrance to the dungeon,
3. A monster found the entrance to the dungeon
4. A poor commoner found the entrance to the dungeon
5. Someone powerful found the entrance to the dungeon
6. The party of the adventurers found the entrance to the dungeon.

At long last
