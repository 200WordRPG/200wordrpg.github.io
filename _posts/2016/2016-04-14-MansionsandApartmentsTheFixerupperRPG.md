## Author Comments (if any)

I was inspired by renovating my apartment when participating in this contest. The idea was to have players renovating rambling, Gothic, Mordheim-ish mansions for resale value rather than just exploring a dungeon crawl. The balancing is horrible, but I feel that realistically simulates the stress of fixing up an old house with limited manpower and on a deadline.
