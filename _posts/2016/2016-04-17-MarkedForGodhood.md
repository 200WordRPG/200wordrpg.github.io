Take a Mark from another onto yourself, or 
Change one Mark back to an Anchor. 
Explain how.

Is Godhood+Marks highest? You are guided by your Godhood and a Mark - explain how.
Adversary changes an Anchor to a Mark. Adversary explains how.

you can also: 
Advocate - Explain how you help or hinder - Roll Godhood or Humanity when another marked rolls. Higher than theirs? Replace their roll. Explain how.
Tempt Fate - Ask a loaded question, roll both dice, Adversary answers: Humanity is higher? a horror. Godhood is higher? - a wonder.

## Author Comments (if any)

This is an adversarial game without losers. Revel in that and make up your own goals.
Adversary, do not hold back. Shower them with gifts and terrors.
Marked, enjoy how it feels. You will be adversary soon enough.
Let people interpret and express what they think that "humanity" and "godhood" means.

This game is inspired by 
Epidiah Ravachol's "Swords without master" If you like my game, try his game. It will blow your mind.
       and
The two web comics "Ava's Demon" and "Kill Six Billion Demons". Read them for inspiration if you want. You won't regret it - guaranteed.
