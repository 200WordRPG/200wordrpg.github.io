4+ players: One is God, everybody else is a Misfit. 
Every Misfit has a degrading job and one need. 

Tools:
Every Misfit has 6 Tokens. 
2d6

God, old and forgetful, needs to rewrite the Ten Commandments. He appears and: 

THE CHOSEN ONE 
God chooses a Misfit, who, to prove his valour, starts to tell something epic he once ran into.  

The other Misfits can take action and: 
Say he’s a liar and tell how things really went: take a Token from him 
Say he’s right and tell what furthermore he did: give him a Token 

God can stop the Misfits at will. As God, you don’t want them collect more than 12 Tokens. 

Now the Chosen One rolls 2d6 and confronts the result with the number of Token he has. 

If he rolls the same value or below, he can write the First Commandment deducing a moral from his tale. He then tells another story. 
If he rolls above, God states the First Commandment inspired by the story, takes off one of his Token and chooses another Misfit. 

Have the Ten Commandments done!
