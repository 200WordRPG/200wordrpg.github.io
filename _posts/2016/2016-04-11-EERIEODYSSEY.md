EERIE ODYSSEY
A game about fears
 
Prepare your character:
Pick one trait (e.g. strong, nimble, eidetic memory)
Pick one flaw (e.g. over-confident, timid, short-sighted)
Pick one fear (e.g. arachnophobia, fear of the dark, fear of loneliness)
 
Story:
You are travelling through a location on a journey of sorts. But who are you? Why are you travelling together, and through where? And where to? Discuss the setting among you before you start.
(Examples: you are travelling through an abandoned town on your way to your company cabin. You are night watchmen patrolling the museum.)
 
Play:
Players take turns initiating scenes, starting with the oldest player. On your turn, set a scene in which the player to your left is confronted by his/her fear. Feel free to include as many of the other players in the scene as you like, including yourself. Any player who dies in a scene, is out of the game.
(Example: “Walking through the Egyptian exhibit you hear a strange clicking, as of clawed feet on the marble floor. Then your flashlight goes out.”)
 
Ending:
The game ends when all players have faced their fear, or when all players are dead. Whichever comes first.
