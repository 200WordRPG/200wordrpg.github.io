# Submissions Open in Three Days

Rules and details can be found on the main site: [https://200wordrpg.github.io/](https://200wordrpg.github.io/)

### The Goal: Design a tabletop role-playing game using 200 words or less.

**Impossible you say? Not so!**

In fact it's the perfect challenge to try out some new ideas. A 200 word limit will put your editing and writing skills to the test. 

And yet it's a project you could complete in just a few days. No need to write hundreds of pages with artwork, layout, and marketing. Just writing. Intense, brutal writing.

**To help you get started,** I've collected some helpful tips from across the internet:

* Brent Newhall, one of last year's Judges, [gives an inside look from the judges perspective.](https://www.reddit.com/r/200wordrpg/comments/8jbxez/veterans_of_past_years_what_advice_do_you_have/dyyrmsk/)
* A great [thread of advice and ideas.](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DavidSchirduan/posts/91jrMgnVx6d)
* Ivan gives [detailed tips on common pitfalls.](http://atgn.com.au/10-lessons-last-years-200-word-rpg-challenge/)
* An experienced 2015 finalist [offers advice on finding inspiration.](https://www.reddit.com/r/200wordrpg/comments/8jbxez/veterans_of_past_years_what_advice_do_you_have/dz0769s/)

And one small piece of advice from me: **Avoid "The" titles.** "The Door", "The Event", "The Whatever". Those games all get lumped together alphabnetically and kind of drag on.
