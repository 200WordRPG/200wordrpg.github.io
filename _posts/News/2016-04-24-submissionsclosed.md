# Submissions Closed! Now What?

Now we will double and triple check all entries to make sure everything looks good before we hand it off to the [judges]({{site.baseurl}}/judges)! They will review and rank the entries so that each entry is read by at least two judges. Good luck!

A rough schedule is posted below. Until then, check out some of the incredible [2017 entries]({{site.baseurl}}/2017entries), play them, hack them, discuss them, or just enjoy reading them!

# Judging Process

**Round 1** (April 26th - May 3rd)

Judges will be assigned a number of entries to read (so that each entry is read by at least 2 judges). Each judge will select their top 4 entries, writing a short spotlight about each one and why they chose it. 

**Round 2** (May 5th and May 6th)

Judges will read through the semi-finalists and give every entry a "yay" or "nay" based upon whether they think that game deserves to win. The entries with the most “yays” will be the finalists (might be 3, might be 7).

**Round 3** (May 7th)

All judges will have a face-to-face meeting and unanimously agree on the top 3 winners. The winners will be announced and rewarded on May 8th, Monday morning!
