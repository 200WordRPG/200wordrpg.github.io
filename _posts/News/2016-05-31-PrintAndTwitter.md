First some **quick announcements**:

 * Submissions are open for a Spanish 200 Word RPG Challenge! [Desafío de un Juego de Rol en 200 Palabras](http://200palabras.nogarung.com/). Get your submissions in before it ends!

 * A similar contest in French begins in just a few days, so get ready for that. [Réussir à créer un jeu de rôle en 250 mots pas plus](https://www.facebook.com/iletaitunefoisunpetitjeuderole/).
 

## Random Entry of the Day
The [@200WordRPG twitter account](https://twitter.com/200WordRPG) has been revived! It will post a random 200WordRPG every single day. This is a great way to generate discussions and read through some lesser known entries. I hope you all enjoy it!

## Print Collection Available!
All 697 entries are available in two huge printed volumes. If you participated in this year's challenge, now you can be a *Published Game Designer™* and have a copy of your submission on the shelf! 

Each volume is $11 (not including shipping), and was beautifully designed by <a href="http://thomas-novosel.com/">Thomas Novosel</a></td>. Get them from the [Downloads page here]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads)!
