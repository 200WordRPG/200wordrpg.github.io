# Community Discussion

The [judging process](https://200wordrpg.github.io/news/2017/04/24/submissionsclosed.html) continues to go well; finalists should be announced later this week.

# Neat Reviews
Of course, reading these entries is entertainment by itself. To hear some other thoughts on notable entries check out these review series:

### [Random Reviews by Jeff Aldrich](https://plus.google.com/collection/c_evGE)
Jeff starts off by listing a detailed structure for hw he will judge and analyze the random entries. It really helps give the reviews a little more weight and substance.

### [Favorites by Ray Otus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/0inoGE)
Ray goes through and posts little mini-reviews of his favorite entries.

### [Review Diary by Ivan Nevill](http://roleplaygreenroom.blogspot.com.au/)
This brave soul aims to review all of the entries before the judges do! He does a great job of defining what makes a good game vs what makes a winner. Really good stuff.

### [Simple Review Challenge by Ole Peder G.](https://plus.google.com/102301641043299892498/posts/1MzUjA4AyVH)
It's a simple challenge: Read a random entry and post a short review of it on whatever social media you use.

### [200 Word Actual Play by Jacqueline Bryk](https://www.twitch.tv/damoclesthreadgames)
From Jacqueline: "Once a week, after they announce the semi-finalists, I'd like to run one or two of the top entries, plus some of the games I really liked, on my Twitch channel. I'm looking for folks to play via Skype or Hangouts, so if you're ok with being on a live stream, hit me up."

### [200 Word Alphabet by David Schirduan](http://schirduans.com/david/tag/200wordalpha)
I started this series of reviews before the challenge began, and I'll finish it when it's over. I try to feature some of the lesser known entries that deserve more recognition. Enjoy!
