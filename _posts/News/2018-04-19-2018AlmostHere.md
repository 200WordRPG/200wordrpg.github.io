## The 200 Word RPG Challenge Returns for 2018

And what a year it will be! We are expecting over 1000 entries...*HOLY CARP*! 

### Submissions open May 18th. **GET HYPE!**

* The [home page]({{site.baseurl}}/) has been updated with the contest rules.
* The [Judges]({{site.baseurl}}/judges) have been posted.
* This year we have a fantastic groupd of [Readers]({{site.baseurl}}/readers) to help filter through all the entries.
* Prizes will be posted soon. Just collecting the last few tidbits.

### Site Updates

The 200 Word Site now has solid [reddit integration](https://www.reddit.com/r/200wordrpg/). If you want to talk about an entry, just click the **"Discuss This Entry"** button. If no one has talked about it before, it will make a new thread on the 200 Word RPG subreddit. If it's already been talked about, you'll be taken to the thread and can add to the conversation.

The **Entry of the Day** twitter feed is featured along the left-hand side. Hopefully this will promote regular conversation and help the lesser known entries get some love and attention.

The [News]({{site.baseurl}}/news) has a nice collection of past updates, in case you want to travel back in time.

The website finally has an official [Wordcount tool]({{site.baseurl}}/wordcount). Make sure you use this one instead of your local program.

More updates will come as the 2018 challenge approaches!
