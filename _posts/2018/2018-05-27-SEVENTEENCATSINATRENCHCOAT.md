(5+ players & GM)

When the Nefarious Plan entered its final phase, your captors blew up their incriminating lab. KABOOM. Walls to rubble, evidence to ash. But also, cages to splinters. Hooray! Freedom smells of singed cat hair.

Unfortunately the Nefarious Plan is still afoot.

But ho, what's this? A discarded trenchcoat? Quick, everybody get in and act human! You have to warn the Prime Minister before it's too late!


FIRST:

-	Cats never get to choose their names. Have the player to your left name you. Write your name down.

-	Write down one skill, acquired from your captors' mad science (dentistry, lawn care, etc.)

-	Do this without thumbs. No thumbs on cats!



MANOUVERING YOUR WOBBLING TRENCHCOAT

-	Upon encountering an obstacle each player describes a unique plan for success.

-	The GM secretly selects the Best Plan.

-	By simultaneous pointing, players vote to enact one plan. Most votes wins.

-	If the plan chosen is the Best Plan, the trenchcoat succeeds!

-	Otherwise, count the number of votes received by the elected plan and add +1 for each applicable player skill.

-	If the total exceeds the number of players, the trenchcoat succeeds!

-	Else, the GM introduces a complication. Oh no!

-	Coin flips decide draws.

Observant readers will note that the difficulty of overcoming obstacles increases as you add more cats (players) to the trenchcoat. This is a feature, not a bug.
