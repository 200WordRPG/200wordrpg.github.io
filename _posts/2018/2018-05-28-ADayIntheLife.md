You are creating a world together. One where people live, go to work, and maybe something out of the ordinary happens. It can be as mundane, or as fantastical, as you desire.

This is a game for 2-5 players. You could push five, however you may find that too hectic.

To begin, go around in a circle. Have each player define something about your world. It can be anything from the style of structures, to the type of food people eat, or the way people interact. Whoever defined that trait now has ownership over that aspect of the world.

Each player also creates a character and loosely defines how they interact with the world.

Begin with the last person to define something about the city and once again go in a circle. They will begin to narrate a typical day for their character. Other players can help out with conversations they have thought the day. When they encounter something that another player owns the aspect of, they can stop you and complicate your day. Then the person who is narrating explains how their character would navigate and overcome the complication.
