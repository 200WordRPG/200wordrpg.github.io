Decide to play this game before a trip.

PRIMUS 
Know this, you are all REFUGEES who escaped from a Secret War!  WHO WERE YOU BEFORE?

SECUNDUS
Psychically gifted - you catch glimpses from that world; but cursed - the War still ravages the Magical World you left behind, and now you can only bear witness. As you travel this Mundane World, you journey across the Secret World. 

Look for GRAFFITI. When it catches your eye, take a photograph. Each GRAFFITO is an eruption of psychic energy from that Secret War piercing the veil between our realities:

Is it an omen? Portent?  Lie. A rare Truth?
Perhaps, a request? Instructions? A map?
A victorious tale, or a doomed romance?
The last words of a queen, or a beggar?
A spell or dread ritual?  An attack!
The sig√ªl of your nemesis...

What it is, what it was, what it means - a riddle to be solved.

TERTIUS
Share your findings when your Cohort gathers.  Hopefully, through the Alchemy of Combination, we can understand these sendings and images. SHARE A GRAFFITO, explain what you think it means. Perhaps, another refugee will find meaning in it, and bring forth their own. Solve the Riddle. BEAR WITNESS.
