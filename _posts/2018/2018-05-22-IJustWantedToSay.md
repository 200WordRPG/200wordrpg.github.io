<<Needs: 2 people>>

*************************************************************************************************************

Hold your breath...




!








!!











!!!
















!!!!




















!!!!!


First to exhale: Receiver (RE)
Second: Arriver (AR)

*************************************************************************************************************

Welcome to the Afterlife.

AR's new here. RE isn't. 
//Can you navigate past ghosts together?//

*************************************************************************************************************

Both: put up 1-6 fingers behind your back; reveal simultaneously. 

If matching numbers/1 and 3 are revealed, retry. 
If not, find your word pair:

| 		=True
| |		=Friend
| | |		=False
| | | |		=Love
| | | | |	=Enemy
| | | | | |	=Family

AR: tell RE who they are to you, based on first thoughts provoked by the word pair. 
RE: process this, then tell AR who they are to you. 

Both: decide how ready you are to talk. Put up 1-5 fingers behind your back; reveal simultaneously. 
Combined fingers = number of steps between you.

*************************************************************************************************************

Take turns wading through the Afterlife like so:


RE: recite a memory you've shared. 

AR:  count through 1-5 on a hand behind your back repeatedly, varying speed, until RE says stop. 
This number = number of spaces AR can move towards/away from RE.

AR: Move. 




Then it's RE's turn, swapping actions.


*************************************************************************************************************

Once you meet, think about your relationship, what you want to say. 

...





....








.....












......


AR: say your piece. 

RE: respond. 

Both, optional: follow up once. 

*************************************************************************************************************

Decide if you feel more at peace. Proceed through the Afterlife.

I wanted to try and create an RPG that you could play anywhere, anytime (no need for pencils/paper/dice/etc.), fuelled purely (as most RPGs largely are!) by the relationship at hand being explored. I was curious how our opinions of people change both as we reminisce and learn new things about them, and the ways this influences our interactions. I hope this game provokes some of this - and is enjoyable!

Thanks to JP Hung and Jordan Draper for reading/testing and giving me feedback on my piece :-)
