PREREQUISITES:
- 3+ Players
- Paper
- Pencil

OVERVIEW:
Players tell the story of a fictional item, the people who use it, and the world it belongs to.

SETUP:
Select one player to be the CREATOR. All remaining players are HOLDERs.

GAMEPLAY:
The game begins with the CREATOR, then continues with each HOLDER in a clockwise rotation until each player has had one turn.

On a player's turn, they must complete the following steps specific to their role (CREATOR, HOLDER) in sequence.

CREATOR TURN:
- Who are you?
- What year is it?
- Where are we?
- Create a fictional item. How was it made? Why was it created? What does it do?
- Roughly sketch your item on a sheet of paper.
- Pass the item to the next player.

HOLDER TURN:
- Who are you?
- What year is it now?
- How has the world changed?
- How did the item come into your possession? What do you do with it? How does it make you feel?
- If you are not the last HOLDER, pass the item to the next HOLDER.
OR
- If you are the last HOLDER, tear up the sketch.
- What happened to the item?
- How did its legacy end with you?

Thank you for the opportunity to participate. It was a lot of fun creating a system that allowed a wide array of storytelling.

I want to give a quick shout-out to Eric Dicy for all of his support.
