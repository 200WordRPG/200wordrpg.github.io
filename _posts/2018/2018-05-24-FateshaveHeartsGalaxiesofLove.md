After each date, the host awards a modifier (+1,+2, or +3) based on how descriptive, suitable, and above all, how scientifically accurate the date was. Players roll a D6 and add their result plus modifier to their heart fates count.

The player with the most heart fates wins. In the event of a draw, the tallest player wins.
