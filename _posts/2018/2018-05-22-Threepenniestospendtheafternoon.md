```
SETTING: Toss a coin thrice...

    HHH: You have a week to scape from prison before getting hanged.
    HHT: You all had had the same premonitory nightmare.
    HTH: Returning from an expedition, you find your hometown burned to ashes.
    HTT: You end up in a deadly and mysterious place after after someone sabotaged your ship.
    THH: Someone wants to hire you to carry out a suspiciously simple task.
    THT: After writing you a cryptic letter, a good friend of you dissapears.
    TTH: You escaped from a secret governmental installation and are getting chased.
    TTT: You accidentally discover that ridiculous urban legend turns out to be true.

The narrator fleshes out the setting with details. Then, each player describes their character.

RULES: Every time you want to do something risky toss three coins...

    3 heads: You narrate your complete success.
    2 heads: Someone else narrates your partial success.
    1 heads: You narrate your partial failure.
    0 heads: Someone else narrates your complete failure.

Fix one coin as heads/tails before the toss if everyone else agrees that you have a clear advantage/disadvantage in that situation.

There aren't character sheets, stats or health system, all consequences (positive or negative) are handled narratively.

A fast and simple game to spend the afternoon with just some pocket change.

It is aimed to improvised games in situations where a normal conversation (and the occasional toss of 3 coins) doesn't draw attention but more traditional forms of role-playing might be frowned upon (public transport, waiting in a restaurant, at work...).

It uses my own minimalist system called T3CS (https://github.com/CarlosLunaMota/MyRPG/tree/master/My%20Free%20RPG/The%203%20Coins%20System) but adds eight (rather generic) adventure seeds to help the narrator to come out with an interesting story on the fly. 

As usual on games of this size, it relies heavily on making ad hoc decisions during the game, but attempts to delegate most of the narrator's responsibilities to the table consensus so that he/she can focus on the story.
