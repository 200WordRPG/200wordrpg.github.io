You are a teenager, chatting with classmates after school. You deeply love something that you're sure is only for children. You don't know anyone who shares your passion.

-------------------

Pick your passion, keep it secret.

3 or 4 players, pick from:
 * those studded building blocks
 * that friendship cartoon

5 or 6 players, add:
 * that colourful martial arts super-team
 * those funny animal comics

More players, add:
 * dinosaurs
 * that tabletop game with dragons

These things are childish and uncool. It's cool to hate them now, but acceptable to admit you liked them when you were a child.

-------------------

You want to:
 * talk about your passion as much as possible;
 * find someone who shares your interest;
 * prove you're cool and adult.

You must:
 * disparage childish things in conversation;
 * mock anyone whose passion is revealed publicly, even if you share it.

You can:
 * discuss how you liked passions in the past, but, you know, intellectually;
 * probe how others feel or felt about passions.

Secretly gain points:
 * coolness, by disparaging any passion, even yours;
 * satisfaction, by mentioning your own passion positively;
 * participation, by mentioning another passion positively.

-------------------

You win if you find someone who shares your passion.
You lose if someone mocks you when your passion's revealed.
