A game for 3 players.
This life falls behind you.
Together, you march away.

----

Describe the world:

Each player flips 2 coins, picking a word per the result.
Heads describes the world.
Tails describes the fall.

Don't tell anyone your word. Write it down.
Then show your words and discuss how they fit together.

----

Set out a deck of cards.

Each suit represents aspects of life as you flee.
When you play a card, pick either aspect.

spades - respect/power
hearts - bonds/tools
diamonds - wealth/justice
clubs - home/security

Number represents amount of people responsible for the aspect.
Face cards are important individuals.
----

Describe your character:

Draw 3 cards. 2 aspects are abundant, 1 is deficient.
Keep your cards. You can play them later, swapping for others.
But always 2 abundant, 1 deficient.

----

In play:

Start clockwise from the youngest.

Draw a hand of 7 cards.
Play 2 cards and set a scene, 1 is gaining an aspect, 1 is forfeit.
Roleplay a scene of 5 minutes.

Another character may play up to 1 card per scene, entering it to give or take an aspect.

If you end with 1 card, play your scene of forfeiture.

This world ends afterwards.
