You will tell the story of an asteroid belt space station, rebelling against their colonial masters on Earth.
 
Shuffle a deck of cards.
 
Each turn, everyone draws a card. The first player narrates how a problem on the station is exposed, discarding a card and selecting the problem using its RANK. 
 
                             -RANK-
           A : Oxygen                      8 : Corruption        
           2 : Food                        9 : Crime             
           3 : Medicine                   10 : Police Brutality             
           4 : Gravity                     J : Imprisonment          
           5 : Work Accident               Q : Disappearances
           6 : Lockout                     K : Assassination
           7 : Taxation
                                          
At any time another player may yell "Riot!". They narrate the riot, and put a card into the voting pile, selecting who is hurt in the riot using the card's SUIT.
 
                             -SUIT-
       CLUBS : The Station          DIAMONDS : Civilians
      HEARTS : Rebels                 SPADES : Earth officials
 
Until yet another player says "Breaking News!". They do a media coverage of the riot, and put a card into the voting pile, selecting who the coverage favors using the card's COLOR.
 
                             -COLOR-
         RED : Rebels                  BLACK : Earth                 
 
The game ends when no cards are left in the deck.
If the voting pile has more red than black cards, the station gains independence, otherwise it remains a colony. Taking turns, each player shortly describes the price the people pay.
