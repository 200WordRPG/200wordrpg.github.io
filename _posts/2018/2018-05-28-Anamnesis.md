[[>======= March 2, 2086 =======<]]

Earth hungers, suffering extreme resource deprivation. The AI-led Martian Republic resists.

You are elite operatives tasked with accomplishing an objective defined by the Mission Director.

You have been activated for an urgent mission deployment. Use of Special Project 493 is authorized.

You will succeed. 

Name yourself. Describe your personality. How do you approach challenge? What equipment and training do you have? Explain why you became an operative and detail your first mission. 

[[>======= CRITICAL ALERT -- INCURSION -- COGNITION KILL TECHNOLOGY DETECTED -- CRITICAL ALERT =======<]]

Play Begins. 

The Mission Director is the Inquisitor. You are now witnesses. 

The enemy has attacked.

No trace of any enemy operative exists in your memory: wind blew the door open; the guard slipped and broke her neck; corrupted AI opened the airlock.

The Inquisitor will question you about the event. Answer truthfully. Work together to piece together the incursion. What was the objective? How did the enemy succeed?

Before asking a question, the Inquisitor will determine the answer's difficulty: easy (30 seconds), or hard (90 seconds).

Showcase your operative, or another. If you directly refer to any operative, or your response isn't long enough, this isn't the answer. Another witness must respond to the question.
