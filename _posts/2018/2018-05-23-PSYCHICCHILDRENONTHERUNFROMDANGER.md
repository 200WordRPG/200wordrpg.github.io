You are a PSYCHIC CHILD, the result of some unethical experiments. You and some of the other children have BROKEN OUT and are on the run from menacing agents who track you down.

Choose a PSYCHIC SPECIALTY - Telekinesis, Telepathy, Pyrokinesis, etc.

Decide what you REMEMBER from BEFORE - A treehouse, a book, a sweet treat, and other such things.

When you must use your powers, predict what the next card drawn from a deck of playing cards will be.

If your card is the same COLOR, your power does not harm you.

If you get the SUIT right, you have little control over your power. 

If you get the RANK correct, your power bends to your will, and you may do one thing with it as you choose.

If you guess the card EXACTLY, you AWAKEN. Your power dictates the course of the scene.

If you FAIL completely, you are stressed. Place the card in front of you, and if you have ten cards you are EXHAUSTED, and may be captured!

You must follow your MEMORY to find a SAFE PLACE. When your memory relates to the challenge before you, you may draw THREE cards and choose ONE. Good luck, children.
