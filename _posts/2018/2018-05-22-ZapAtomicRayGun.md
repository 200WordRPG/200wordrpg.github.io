You're out of this world in a cosmos peopled with silver aliens, questionably dressed humanoids, and subterranean monsters.

JUMP! DODGE! THINK!  . . .  2d6

Atomic rays are the most advanced discovery in the known galaxies. Ray guns come in many colours and flavours, most have just two settings: stun and kill. 

ZAP! . . . . . . . . . . .  3d4

Spaceships with atmosphere and gravity, flashing lights and crackling intercoms, buzz between planets. Airlocks need opening, robots programming, engines repairing, rockets piloting.

BEEP BOOP! . . . . . . . .  d12

Planets, moons, asteroids are breathable, sprout vegetation, have sentience. Their surfaces solid or shattered, their atmosphere hostile or amenable.

WOOSH! . . . . . . . . . .  d8+d4

Pit yourself against the universe:

- A ray gun fires (3d4), you attempt to dodge (2d6)
- Lunar mushrooms explode in clouds of poisonous spores (d8+d4), you wrestle on your helmet (d12)

Fail your action, dock ONE related quirk point.

Succeed automatically by docking TWO quirk points.

Ties are rerolled.

Quirk points run out? You're nothing but stardust.

         *  *  *  *  *

Starting quirk points (roll and note down):

- Tendency to not die . . . 4d4 
- Preparedness  . . . . . . 1d12
- Social standing . . . . . 1d8
- Blind luck  . . . . . . . 1d6
- Add your own  . . . . . . 1d4

Choose your species, name, spaceship.

The universe needs discovering, go explore.

ZAP!

A whimsical hack n' zap created to evoke feelings of 1950s pulp sci-fi movies and early 20th century science fantasy when you could build your own spacecraft in your shed and hot air balloons were a legitimate means of travelling to the moon.
