Choose a Goal:

	Eat 				
	Scritches			
	Murder				
	Human Food			
	Sing the Song of your People	
	Sleep				
	Investigate			
	RUN!	
			
Choose a number between 1 and 6, roll 2d6.

If the numbers:
match - Success! Narrate your excellence. Spend a Round enjoying your superiority.
 
are different, but one shows your number - add together for your butt-wiggle-pool.
 
are different, but not your number - subtract the smaller from the larger then subtract from your butt-wiggle-pool (if you reach zero, take a Round to push stuff off the table).

are a 1 and a 6 - it's a Botch, oh no. You have been scooped up and snuggled. But you are a cat, so spend a Round licking yourself, erase your butt-wiggle-pool then choose a new Goal.

At 12 butt-wiggles, Success! Narrate your tenacity and endurance.

Each time a 1 appears a Terrible Thing appears! A Busy Human, Sky Water, Closed Doors, That Dog! or A Noise. Narrate vanquishing the Terrible Thing.

Once you have achieved all Goals, you are Best Cat but also become a Terrible Thing, when you roll two 1s, narrate accordingly.

The game ends when all cats are Best Cats. Or continues, nobody tells cats what to do.
