You're a trainer of monsters, questing through the land to do good with your adorable companions!

Find your monster!
. get two stickers, combine them into a unique monster
. draw a box around it
. draw some special effects
. give the monster a name and a type (e.g. Stachebear, grooming-type)
. write three Moves (e.g. Entangle) and a type each Move belongs to

Find other trainers!
Either out in the wild or in your own home.

Solve Problems!
Look around and pick something to turn into a weird, fantastical problem. You both need to provide one Move each and one to combine with the other trainer's monster. Describe your monster and narrate these moves to solve the problem! Mark 2XP each.

Or You Can Battle!
Describe your monsters, pick and describe a Move. Both briefly discuss which would get type advantage. They win the round. Play a second time with remaining moves and a third if there's a tie. If still tied, flip a coin. Winner marks 3XP, Loser marks 1XP.

Evolutions!
Every 5XP, add a sticker, a new move and a type for it. At five stickers, retire your monster to the wild and start again.

My aim was to replicate actions in popular pocket monster media and ‘duelling’ RPGs where people can meet other people at cons or out in the wild to play out some brief fiction with each other.
