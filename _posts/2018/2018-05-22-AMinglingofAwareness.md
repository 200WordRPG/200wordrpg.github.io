Boko-maru: the supreme act of worship of the Bokononists, which is an intimate act consisting of prolonged contact between the naked soles of the feet of two persons. It is said to be the "mingling of awareness."

When playing this game, sit on the floor. Bare your feet, and be sure you have washed yourself. Together you will be telling the story of a lone traveler seeking enlightenment. 

Touch your soles to the other player's. Set a scene, then ask them a question. They will answer it, then continue the scene and ask a new question.

When choosing a question to ask, consider the feel and character of the other player's feet. How do they move? Are they timid, or comfortable? Rough, or soft? Do you feel invited or rebuffed? How alike are their feet to those of the traveller?

Here are some example questions:

How do they react to that?
When do they get there?
How long does that take?
Who sees that?
How does that go wrong?

Play ends when one of you is asked a question you don't want to answer, or one of you retracts your foot.
