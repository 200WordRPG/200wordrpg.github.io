You have died and find yourself in hell. 

The Devil will release you if you can identify a fellow captive and keep your identity a secret.

Players select a deceased historical figure.

For every year since your death, take a point. Keep points secret until a tie, highest total breaks it.

Players RP, asking and answering questions, with only the knowledge their characters would have.

Cleopatra could not ask if someone was on television.

Deal a french deck as evenly as possible. Death, like life, is unfair. 

Decide who begins. They may pass, or assign a card to another player, who follows the card's directive, and then plays a card. Once played, discard cards. A player can risk half their cards to guess an identity. If a player runs out of cards or is correctly guessed they're eliminated. Play until there's a winner.
