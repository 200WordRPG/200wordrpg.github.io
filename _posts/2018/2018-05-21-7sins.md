7sins

You will all die sinners or win through Redemption. 

You're holding hostages in a bank heist and rigged a time bomb for 1 hour, this isn't going to be easy. 

Set the timer. 

Escape or die.

========
Character creation.
========

Name:

Roll 19d8, adding 1 point to the characteristics in the following chart based on those rolls:

Roll - Characteristic

1 - Pride
2 - Gluttony
3 - Envy
4 - Lust
5 - Sloth
6 - Wrath
7 - Greed

8 - Redemption

========
Conflict Resolution.
========

When faced with conflict, like shooting someone or seducing cops, the GM may simply say you succeed or fail.

Or they can create an "Opportunity."

========
Opportunity.
========

GM will state a Sin this conflict relates to. 

The player may either concede, thus failing automatically but simultaneously losing 1 point in that Characteristic and gaining 1 point of Redemption. 

Or they can roll a d8. 

Rolling a 1 or below their Characteristic score gives a critical success with spectacularly good results. 

Rolling an 8 is a critical failure. You may die.

Anything in between gives an expected but average result.

========
Dying and Ascension
========

If a character dies, immediately roll a d8. 

Rolling their Redemption or below means they ascend, otherwise they are judged unworthy.

I'm hoping for very interesting characters.
