```
For 2-5 players.
Requires Tarot deck.

Divide the Tarot into suits.
Give one to each Agent.
The Dreamer takes the Arcana.

Dreamer:
* Names a memory the Agents must try to access;
* Narrates the scene of the dream.

Agents:
* Try to navigate the dream and draw out the memory.

Challenges:
* Agent shuffles and draws a card.
* Dreamer draws an Arcana card (-10 for cards over 10).
* Whoever gets higher describes the outcome. Ties are a stalemate.

Hostile Challenges:
* If Agent loses, they look at their deck and discard values totaling the difference.

Special cards:
Agents:
Page - failure, with upside
Knight - success, with downside
Queen - success with Compassion
King - success with Authority

Dreamer:
Fool - Agent succeeds, regardless
World - Agent fails, regardless

Changing the Dream:
* Agent calls for a Change.
* Dreamer deals one Arcana card.
* To proceed, Agent looks at their deck and plays cards onto the Arcana equal to its value.
* Agent describes the Change, relating to the Arcana's meaning/imagery.
* Challenges during a Change are Hostile.
* Cards stay in play, and are returned once the Change is resolved.
* If Agent does not pay, they must discard one random card.

Agents who run out of cards are ejected from the dream.
