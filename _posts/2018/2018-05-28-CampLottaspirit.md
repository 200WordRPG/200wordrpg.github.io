Divide players into a Scout Patrol (up to four people) and a Counselor (GM). Give one standard card deck to the Patrol and one to the Counselor. The Counselor has the Patrol choose a name, and has each Scout introduce themselves with the following:

Name
Two best camp skills
One worst camp skill (Optional: keep this secret!)

The Patrol's goal is to defeat the GM-controlled Ghost at the end of the five-day camp. Each turn represents one day. Each day, the Patrol chooses one merit badge for the whole patrol to attempt. 

Merit Badges:

Swimming
Hiking
Archery
Basketry
Archaeology
Medic
Music
Astronomy
Astrology
Ghost stories
Skiing
Carpentry
Sports
Theater
Lifesaving
Silence
Friendship
Farming
Poisonous Animals
Sailboating

They roleplay attempting this merit badge. Beware, the Ghost can (through roleplay) try to interfere! The Counselor determines which players successfully earned the badge. Each successful player chooses one card to remove from either the Patrol or Ghost deck. 

After five days, it's time to battle! Shuffle each deck. The Patrol and Ghost battle by playing the topmost card from their deck, with highest card winning and earning a point (ties to the Ghost.) Whichever side reaches ten points first wins the game.
