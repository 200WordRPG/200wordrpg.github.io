Players collaborate as gamemasters, worldbuilders, AND characters - agents
employed by "The Guild", a shadowy society striving for power through
subterfuge and clandestine missions.

## Author Comments 

This is based on the RPG "Pocket Task Force" I made with my two friends Ola and Victor about fifteen years ago. I converted it to a fantasy setting and got it down to 200 words! We've played and showed the original PTF to at least 50 people and generally got great response, and I think PTFFM transfers the most important parts and should work quite well. :) 

I had a lot of fun doing this - writing and editing down to 200 words is a lot like optimizing code, change two words here to one word - same meaning but less words!

Thanks goes out to the people who gave feedback! Ola, Victor, Alex, Rikard, Karl, and Fredrik! And to the synonym tool at thesaurus.com :D
