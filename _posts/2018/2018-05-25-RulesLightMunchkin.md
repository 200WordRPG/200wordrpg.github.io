```
Prep:
Each player comes up with a character. You (the GM) complete/modify their stats in the appropriate/requested system until they are balanced. Break these down into a few basic attributes, each with a tier, 0 to 3. Write down only those attributes for the players, but say verbally what they represent.

Play:
Players take turns acting, and you adjudicate with the appropriate rulebooks. If you get sick of that, instead you and each player notes the relevant attribute and rolls a die. On a maximum roll, increase tier by 1 and roll again, on a 1, subtract and roll again. Highest tier, or highest roll with equal tier, wins.

Tier/Point Cost (Optional):
0/0
1/1
2/3
3/6

EXAMPLE: 3.5 D&D

Dice: d20s

Power Tiers: Mundane, Extraordinary, Godlike, Arbitrary

Attributes:
Offense - Opposes Defense as an action. If successful, the defender can't act this combat.
Defense - Opposes Offense.
Social - For talking to people. Opposes Social.
Utility - For all other noncombat situations.

Example Bonuses/Point Cost:
Taunt/4 - As an action, make enemies only attack you this turn.
"Actually..."/1 - Once per game, say "Actually..." to get a favorable ruling or +1 tier to a roll.
