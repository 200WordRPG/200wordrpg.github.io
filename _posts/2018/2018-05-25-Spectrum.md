```
You are a group of volatile people confined in close quarters. Maybe you are in prison, a group of high schoolers going through puberty, or astronauts getting cabin fever. Emotions are running high and everyone wants to get out.

You need a bag of M&Ms to play.

At the beginning of the game, decide on a situation with a goal the players are working towards. Then, go around the circle and each player introduces their character. 

At the beginning of each round, a player draws an M&M from the bag and narrates what happens based on the color. Each player then draws their own M&M from the bag and reacts based on the color they drew. Once everyone has finished reacting, the next player in the circle draws another M&M and starts the next round. The game is over when you run out of M&Ms. 

Events:
Red - It all goes horribly wrong
Orange - A sudden reversal
Yellow - Crazy coincidence
Green - A secret is revealed 
Blue - Miraculous success
Brown - Something escapes

Reactions:
Red - Anger
Orange - Disgust
Yellow - Joy
Green -  Fear
Blue - Sadness
Brown - Apathy
```
