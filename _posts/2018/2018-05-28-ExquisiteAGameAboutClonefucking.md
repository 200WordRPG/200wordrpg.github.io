For 1 or more players.

Divide a piece of paper into four quadrants. In the first box, put down "Player name:" and write your name. Label the other three boxes "Body," "Brain," and "Personality."

Write down facts about yourself in each of the categories that are true, and also good. Keep going until the sheet is full.

If you're playing with others, each of you should write down a fact, then pass the sheets in a round, helping the other players fill theirs out.

When the stats boxes are full, think about those facts as if they described an interesting stranger and decide: How old are they? Where are they from? What is their name? Write these details in the first box.

Think about the next three lines and narrate your response out loud. If you're playing with others, switch off between each line.
-Where do you take a date you're really excited by? What do they wear? What about you?
-It goes well. Of course it does-they are exquisite. What is your relationship like?
-One day they need to leave. You're sad, but it's time. What will you miss the most?

(If you're squicked out by clonecest or find it morally dubious, make the title "A game about time-travel-self-cest" and add "What year did they come from?" when filling out the character info box.)
