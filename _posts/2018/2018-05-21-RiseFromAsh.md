The world is shrouded in darkness. Whether this is the long-gone past or after the future matters not. 
The Players are travelers, the last remnants of a dead civilization. Each Player carries an artifact and the clothes on their back. The artifact may be anything, a sword, a rifle, a lantern or coil of rope. Artifacts can run out of power, bullets or fuel. 
Everything is against them. Hunger, cold, darkness, savage animals, barbaric raiders, mad Sun-Cults, genetically engineered murder machines and rogue robots. Only together can they hope to survive, thrive and bring light back to the world.
When there is a difficult task or challenge to overcome the Player rolls a D6. 4+ means success. Rolls using an artifact get +1. Extremely difficult tasks get -1 or -2. Players get 3 wound slots and 1 mortal wound. If all slots are filled they go into a coma and (depending on the damage type) pass out or bleed out.
One player Is the GM until a player dies. Then that player becomes the GM and the GM creates a player. GM's should throw challenging adventures in the group's path, but also give them chances to heal and resupply.
