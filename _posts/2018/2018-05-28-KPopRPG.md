Ever wondered how your favorite KPop group would do in a D&D-like setting?  Is your Bias better off as a Paladin, a Ranger, or a Mage?  Wonder no more and play as your favorite Idols in KPop RPG; or, create your own Idol group to play with!

If leveling up is wanted, the GM can hand out points to put into Skills, Tough, and Heart at whatever rate they deem appropriate.
