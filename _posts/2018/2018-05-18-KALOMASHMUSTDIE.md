---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One player is KALO MASH, MINOTAUR CYBERNECROMANCER, RIGHTFUL RULER OF ALL THINGS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Draw your labyrinth fortress twice, once revealed, once hidden with Hazards, KALO MASH at the center.
Rate Hazards 2-5, totaling 30. 
Rate KALO MASH 6.

------------------------------------------
All others are Adventurers. Doomed heroes.
------------------------------------------

Describe yourself, 2 words.
Examples: "Orc Barbarian, Witch Hacker, Angry Bees"
Get 3 HP.

-------------------------------------------------
KALO MASH will CONQUER EARTH. KALO MASH MUST DIE.
-------------------------------------------------

Each Adventurer explores the labyrinth to reach KALO MASH. Reach and defeat KALO MASH, and KALO MASH dies.

Youngest starts, showing how they navigate. If they run into Hazard, KALO MASH stops them. They roll dice against KALO MASH.

Roll 1 die per HP, +1 for useful class, +1 for good plan, +1 if another Adventurer helps. KALO MASH rolls dice equal to Hazard number.

Higher total wins; KALO MASH wins ties. If Adventurer wins, Hazard goes away, turn passes left; otherwise, lose 1 HP, turn passes right.

If Adventurer has 0 HP, they die. Left and right gain 1 HP if at 1. KALO MASH makes a new Hazard rated 3.


--------
It Ends.
--------


If someone kills KALO MASH, they and any helper win.

I wanted to see if I could fit a good dungeon crawl into 200 words.
