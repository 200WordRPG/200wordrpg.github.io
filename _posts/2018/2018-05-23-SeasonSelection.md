In this game, you take on the role of the board of directors of a new theater in a medium sized town in middle America. Budgets are tight, and it's up to you to decide on what shows you'll produce this season.

You'll need some paper, pens/pencils, and d6s. If you play as a group, come to consensus on the selection.

You have a starting BUDGET of 12.

You have to spend this budget to select 6 shows for the year.

Each type of show has a COST, a PRESTIGE, and a POPULARITY.

Follow the steps:

Choose six shows for the season. Name them.
Run the season. Spend the COST from BUDGET, roll a number of d6s equal to PRESTIGE and POPULARITY for the first show.. For each 5 or 6 rolled for PRESTIGE, gain 1 MERIT. For each 5 or 6 rolled for POPULARITY, gain 1 BUDGET.
Repeat for the remaining 5 shows.
If you have a positive BUDGET and more than 19 MERIT, the season was a success.

TYPE				COST		PRESTIGE		POPULARITY
Blockbuster Musical		6		8			        9		
Classic				        3		5		        	4
Locally Written Show		2		5		        	2
Obscure Backlister		1		2		        	1
```
