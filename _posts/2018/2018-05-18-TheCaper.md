What you need:
- A deck of cards
- Friends

You are group of ne'er do wells who are planning crime and must unravel how and why it went down as you tell it. This is done by taking turns telling the story and by challenging the current storyteller when they say something you don't agree with.

Each player draws 5 cards from the deck when the game starts. When one player challenges another, both play 1 or more card face down from their hand. Reveal all facedown cards at once. The player with the highest total value becomes the new storyteller. All revealed cards are discarded. Each participating player draws 1 new card. Cards have Blackjack values. 

The active player may also challenge the top X cards of the deck during an important. Players get 1 loot for winning a challenge and one more for each card beyond the second in a deck challenge.

The heist is over when the deck is empty. The player with the most loot then has a chance to run with the treasure. Players may challenge the leader with what's left of their hands or give the leader their cards in exchange for a share.
