You all are Iki, a minuscule humanoid creature.
You play a number of moments in Iki's one-day lifespan, in order:
childhood	1
adolescence	2
adulthood	3
maturity	2
decline	1

One player describes one moment of Iki's life, a...
...thing seen / heard / tasted / touched
...person met / creature encountered
...action taken / goal attempted

They then grab a BlackDie if they see this moment as challenging, difficult, painful. Or a WhiteDie if it is beautiful, hearthwarming, joyous.

Another player expands this moment describing how things around Iki look, feel, behave, and then grabbs a b/w die themselves.
Repeat until six dice are grabbed, then roll and sum them up by color.
BlackScore > WhiteScore	= write down one positive or useful Quality of Iki's personality
BlackScore < WhiteScore	= write down one Treasured memory from Iki's experience
BlackScore = WhiteScore	the color with less dice wins

Play a new moment.
If possible, spend an unspent Quality / Treasure to inspire it.
Continue until all of Iki's nine life moments have played out.

Look back at it all and discuss: 
how did Iki die?
what influence did Iki have on other's lives?
which mark did Iki leave in the world?
did Iki's life have worth and meaning?
```

This game was inspired by the "Petalars" story, from the 2011 Thundercats reboot.

It then got mixed with the "Bosco Piccolo" campaign for the FateLess game system I played with Claudia Colini, Antonio Amato and Luca Maiorani; I still thank them for that incredible experience.

For this design I want to thanks my beloved Claudia. She always shies away from "design stuff" but I keep pestering her because, like in this case, she can have awesome ideas.

Ron Edward's game SPIONE also helped me a lot in coming up with the overall play structure and style of player contribution.
