```
At the beginning of the game each player rolls 5 times and adds these words to their "Word Bank". They can use them at any time during an encounter. Players can use as many words as they want so long as they exceed or match the target number. 
The GM rolls 5 times from a separate table and does the same. They use those words to establish the encounter and roll a D6 to establish the difficulty (6's are rerolled).

The difficulty of the encounter will determine the number of words to use: Easy 1, Medium 2, Difficult 3, Hard 4, Impossible 5

Use those words to talk about how the characters resolve the encounter.

When the GM is out of words the person on the right of the GM becomes the new GM. Players reroll up to 5 words. Play continues until everyone was GM once.
