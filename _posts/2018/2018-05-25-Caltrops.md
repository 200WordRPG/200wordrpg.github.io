I have always wanted to make a game based on the d4 and Ninjas. Ever since I stepped on my first d4 I realized that they are just like the caltrops used by ninjas/warriors in feudal Japan. I have tried developing this into a larger game but keeping it simple (and under 200 words) I believe has allowed me to find a fun set of rules to play it with friends. Using narration and timing is the trick to be a successful Ninja in Caltrops the 4d4 RPG.
