Write a break up letter:

Explain how difficult writing this letter is.

If you're brave, reveal the purpose of your letter now.

Explain how it is not your intent to hurt anyone.

Soften the blow by mentioning a virtue you identify with.

Share a happy story of your past made possible by that virtue .

Explain that you have grown as a person, and are ready for the next step.

Cite a character flaw that you dislike.

If you weren't brave before, now reveal the purpose of your letter.

Reflect on your own behavior. How have you exhibited the flaw you dislike? How has that hurt you, or those around you?

Express sadness about this ending, but optimism for the future.

What will you do to be mindful about that going forward? How will that improve your life?

Go to the top of your letter and name that part of yourself.

Sign your letter.

Seal it in an envelope, address it to that part of yourself, where you live, put a stamp on it, and mail it.

When the letter arrives, allow that part of yourself to read it. 
Then let it go.
