NEEDED: 
4 Players;
A Tarot deck; 
An Interaction Deck: 1 Jack, 1 Queen, 1 King, 1 Ace of Hearts and the corresponding seeds of Spades; 
4 Red Wires; 

Each player draws four cards from the Tarot Deck and two from the Interaction Deck. Everyone takes a Red Wire. 
The youngest player starts and chooses a Tarot, puts it on the table and narrates a scene in which his Character is the Protagonist, drawing inspiration from the image of the card. After him, clockwise, the second does the same, and so on, until everyone completes three scenes.

The players must place the Tarots one after the other, in four lines converging at the Fourth Scene, the Final, where all the Characters meet.
Each player can modify a scene of another, using an Interaction Card: Jack, Queen, King and Ace of Hearts indicate, respectively, an ally, a lover, a benevolent authority, a struck of luck.
The corresponding seeds of Spades are the opposite negative. 

The Characters cannot meet until the Final, unless a player uses the Red Wire to connect a newly played card with the last played card of another. Thus, two Characters can act in the same scene.
