Facilitator, 1-3 players, 1d6.
 
You've come here, to this place, to destroy something beautiful. 
 
Decide on a tone together. (Epic? Mundane? Petty?)

TELL ME four things about this place.
(e.g. wretched
above the clouds
hazy
not built to human scale.)
 
TELL ME four things about the beautiful thing.
(e.g. ancient observatory
stained-glass roof
amorphous
has a guardian.)
 
Write them down. This is all that they are. I'll ask clarifying questions as we go.
 
TELL ME:
Why have you come here, destroyer?
What has this beautiful thing done, in your eyes, to deserve destruction?
Why are you cruel?
Who are you?
 
Write these four things down. This is all that you are.
 
Stretch. Get snacks. I'll play the beautiful thing. You'll play out destroying it.
 
WHEN BEAUTY RESISTS DESTRUCTION, I roll.
 
1-3: It destroys something in you. Cross an item off your list. Tell me how you're diminished. 
 
4-6: It cannot resist. Cross something off its list. I'll decide how it's diminished, then introduce a complication. 

If you run out of items, you're enthralled. Tell me how. 

If it runs out of items, congrats. Tell me: what of you survived intact? Was it worth it?
