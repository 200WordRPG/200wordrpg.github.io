The Age of Magic has ended, but here you are - a gang of brilliant, charming, experienced, murderous sorcerers. Choose who is Daznan, Kiffel, Necklace of Ants, Rua. Decide which adjective best describes you. Explain why. Choose which facts apply to each of you:

I'm pursued by Ghatshen, half-ghost magic-hunter.
I owe a deep debt to Iku, an unseeing princess.
I lust for the secrets of Hardeen, a dog butcher.
Moyolehuani, beast of legend, is both lover and enemy.

When you use magic, a weird tattoo covers part of your body commensurate with the power of the spell. Temporary light? Pinprick dot. Fireball? Plate-sized mark. Something even grander? More skin.

Draw a silhouette of your character, front and back. Add ink now - cover 70% - if you are experienced, add more. Brilliant? Add less. Magic is always successful, and only limited by your creativity, nerve, and unmarked flesh.

You are the last of your kind. In Yosol magic is a crime. In Chullwa it is merely reviled. Everywhere it is feared. When the marks become obvious everyone will know you, and when every bit of skin is covered that's it - no more magic for you. Until then, try to do good.

If you play this, consider adding Kur, an apprentice who is stupid, annoying, useless or cowardly and can only use "pinprick dot" magic (or none at all). I playtested this with five players, and this fifth character made the game so much more fun!
