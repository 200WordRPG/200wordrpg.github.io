THE FOLLOWING IS A PAID ADVERTISEMENT:

Life is filled with challenges: opening jars; robbing banks; thwarting mole-men uprisings, that could be just a little easier. Thankfully our OPERATORS are standing by.

Before the game, each OPERATOR takes an index card and writes down the following traits of the PRODUCT they're pitching. PRODUCTS can be: gadgets; services; exercise regimens, anything you'd see advertised on an infomercial.

 -------------------------------------
PRODUCT NAME:

THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY... 
What is the ostensibly normal use for the PRODUCT.

IT CAN EVEN...
What over the top, unnecessary thing can the PRODUCT do? (Work underwater, tow a tractor-trailer, even get out bloodstains!)

BUT WAIT...
Leave blank. Anytime during play, add a single feature to expand the use of your PRODUCT.

THERE'S MORE!
What useless bonus comes prepackaged with the PRODUCT? (Leather carrying case, meat thermometer, lifetime guarantee) 
 -------------------------------------

Then the CONSUMER presents the tribulations of their life. The CONSUMER is woefully incapable of living.

OPERATORS pitch how their PRODUCT would help solve the problem. What leg-up is there over the competition? Showmanship sells! Continue with the CONSUMER elaborating with additional needs they require fulfilled. When satisfied, the CONSUMER selects a PRODUCT to purchase.

Just pay Shipping & Handling.
