[	The plague spread too fast. Everybody was infected, 	]
[	the city gates were sealed. You assist those that 	        ]
[	remain and prevent the illness to escape the walls.	]

Gather:
	- 2-6 players
	- Index cards
	- Map of a medieval city
	- Black markers

You:
        - are infected, write on an index card: how is your Skin? Eyes? Voice?
        - wear a mask, it makes you (write one): SCARY, TRUSTED, SAFE, WEALTHY 

Flash out significant locales on the map,
then the sickest between you takes it.

HOME, PAIN, HOPE, FAMILY, AMBITION, UNREST
Write each on a separate index card:
then everybody chooses one. 
That's your initial TONE.
Use it to:
	- Set scenes and introduce conflict
	- Ask each other questions / give answers
	- Say how the PLAGUE spreads

[	Good questions:						                                        ]
[	- What / who was this [place] / [person]?			                ]
[      	- What's [at risk] / [at odds with my knowledge]?    		        ]
[	- What / who [brought] / [was affected by] the plague here?	]
[	- What's really [going on] / [wrong] here?			                        ]
[      	- What's been done to counteract the plague?    		                ]

Act in turns (when you're up choose one). The PLAGUE:
	- CHANGES: Exchange [your TONE] / [the map] with another player.
	- FESTERS: Blacken something on [the map] / [your index card].
	- EVOLVES: Add something to [your TONE].

[	Play to find out [your end] / [how you evolve].		]
