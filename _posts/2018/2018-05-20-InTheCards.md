Begin play with 4-5 players, and an additional player to be the House. Everyone sits in a circle. The players are a group of friends in high school. Explain who you are, what you like, and how you know your friends.

Going in a circle from the left of the House, draw a card from a tarot deck. The House will interpret it for you. Describe what this means for your character as they become an adult. Do this until every player has gone.

Then, start the circle again. This is middle age. You've stayed in touch with some of your friends, but lost touch with others. When you draw a card, the House will interpret it. Instead of relating it to your character, it impacts the character to your left. Describe your character's role in this. Do this until every player has gone.

Start the circle one last time. This is the twilight years. You've lost touch with all of your friends. Draw a card one more time. The House will interpret it. Instead of relating to you, it impacts the character to your right. Describe your character's role in this.
