Gather pencils; paper; 1d4; 4 players; tokens.

One player is The Brotherhood (TB).
Everybody else plays aspects of The Dude (TD):
   _____________________________________
  | PLAYER |VIRTUE        |VICE         |
  |_____________________________________|
  | 1      |Courage       |Empathy      |
  |_____________________________________|
  | 2      |Loyalty       |Independence |
  |_____________________________________|
  | 3      |Assertiveness |Rebellion    |
   _____________________________________

Everybody answers:

What's TB about? Army, college, sport, religion, politics...

Why does TD want to belong to TB?

 _________________________________________________________
|      |         |  ...TB require members to do?          |
|      | ...does |________________________________________|  
| What |         |  ...make TD uncomfortable about TB?    |
|      |__________________________________________________|  
|      | ...secret would get him banished?                |
 _________________________________________________________


TD acts upon his virtues. Otherwise, he risks banishment.

TB player: use the answers to frame 4 scenes.
Look for conflict; then ask: "What do you do?"

TD players: narrate together what TD does/thinks/says. 
Resolve a conflict: use either your virtue or vice.

Roll 1d4:

    you win, 
        1-and you hide your vice if used.
        2-but you expose vices if used. Take 1-token for each.
    
    you lose, 
        3-and you fail your virtues. Take 3-tokens.
        4-but you can blame someone else. Discard 3-tokens if you do, or take 3.

Narrate the outcome together.

End of game with 4+ tokens: you're banished; otherwise you retain your position. You can discard all your tokens, but another dude is banished instead of you. 

TB narrates consequences.
