The idea for this game began as a seed during the last short trip that my wife and I shared. I thought the idea of trying to face down trouble, attacks from aliens, or otherwise hardship-related stuff was even more difficult to deal with when you're supposed to be on vacation. 

Controlling the length of the game by introducing one bad thing for each day of the vacation will help your RPG group decide exactly how bad you're willing to let things get, and just how gonzo the session might go. I also wanted it to be open-ended, in that a problem that appears on Day 1 might not necessarily be resolved before Day 3. It's completely up to the GM and the players to figure out the pacing.
