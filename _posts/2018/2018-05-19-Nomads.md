NECESSITIES: Yourself, a time piece, maybe a few friends

CHECK THE TIME: When told to do this, look at your time piece. Note the rightmost digit of the current time and use it to consult a chart.

Go somewhere. A walk, a commute, a hike or other. Players take turns telling a story about a group on a journey. What are they seeking?



On their turn, a player may:


Create a character
Name,
A defining feature,
one positive trait,
one negative trait,
one weird trait


Tell a story
CHECK THE TIME, tell the story of an obstacle in your path. Let friends join in.
1-2: A great mystery
3-4: A perilous frontier
5-6: A grueling battle
7-8: A strange creature
9: A deadly intrigue
0: Something else entirely

Tell the story of a character confronting the obstacle.
Near the climax, CHECK THE TIME.
Tell us what happens and how the character is changed:
1-2: A lesson learned
3-4: A blessing granted
5-6: A friend scarred
7-8: A bond strengthened
9: A journey cut short
0: Something else entirely



The journey ends when you reach your destination. Did they find what they seek?
