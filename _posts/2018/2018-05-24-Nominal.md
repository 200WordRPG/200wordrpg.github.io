Agree on a game theme: "80's Soap Opera with horror elements", "a western game set in a dream world".  Brainstorm until you have consensus on a theme.

Players give their character traits: 3 positive, 2 negative, 1 neutral.  Meanwhile the GM Ruminates.

As Play progresses the GM increases the number of dice ("Stakes") rolled representing escalating tension.  Starting at 0 and ending at 6.  

Anything can have traits. A trait is simply something true. Traits applied to an action can come from anywhere.

Resolution:
To answer questions, ("do they see it?") simply compare applicable traits and infer the meaning.
When a player declares an action: roll Fudge Dice equal to the Stakes, add to that the number of applicable positive traits, subtract negative traits.  If positive you succeed, negative you fail, 0 -> describe how things escalated add one dice and roll again.
Only the one acting rolls.

Consequences:
Actions can produce negative or positive traits applied to anything.

Sequencing:
When time needs control, players pass their turn to another player until every character has acted.

Concession:
A player or a GM can concede a scene at any time.  A player must concede if they have accumulated 5 negative traits.
