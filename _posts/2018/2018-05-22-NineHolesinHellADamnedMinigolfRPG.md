```
You and your friends have died, bound for eternal hellfire, but one of you has an opportunity to get out of this predicament. You must defeat your peers in a game of Dante's 'Inferno' style miniature golf.
The game consists of nine holes, one for each circle of hell. For hole one, limbo, each player rolls a d6, the number on the die indicating the number of strokes taken. Each must describe how they get past the first obstacle, the "castle with seven gates. The player with the lowest score wins the hole. 
The winner describes the next hole's obstacle, making it apt for that circle of hell. The losers of each hole must explain something from their character's backstory as to why they are going to hell for the offence that hole represented and how that slight harmed one of the other players. This process is repeated for all nine holes.
The winner of each hole rolls a d6, while loser(s) roll a d4 (ties go to the winner of the previous hole.) The player with the lowest score at the end avoids damnation.
Circles of Hell:
Limbo
Lust
Gluttony
Greed
Anger
Heresy
Violence
Fraud
Betrayal
