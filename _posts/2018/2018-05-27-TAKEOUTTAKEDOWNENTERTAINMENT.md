Rapidfire improv combat powered by the greatest embodiments of cultural stereotyping in our time: Entertainment Wrestling and Takeout Menus.

MATERIALS:
Pens
Paper
Takeout menu with numbered items
d100

KAYFABE CREATION:	
-Each player:
>Chooses one menu - restaurant inspires Team name.
> Rolls d100 twice- the two menu items are Wrestlers.
>Wrestlers have three stats each:
 	>>Highest digit of price = HitPoints
 	>>2nd highest = Damage
 	>>3rd = Style.

ENTRANCE:
-Introduce the Team, Wrestlers, and preferred entrance music.
-Each Player nominates one Wrestler as Active.
-Once all Teams are introduced, all Players:
 	>Synchronise "LETS GET READY TO RUUUMMMMMBBBBBLLLLLEEEE" 
 	>Point to another Player. Most voted Player moves first. 
-Ties break to longest 'RUUUMMMMMBBBBBLLLLLEEEE'.

WRASTLE:
-On your turn choose an Action:
 	>Do a Move: Active Wrestler inflicts their Damage onto another Active Wrestler.
 	>Tag Out: Swap Active Wrestler.
 	>Finisher: Wrestler does Damage equal to their Damage + Style. Cross Out your Wrestler.
-Name and describe action based on any element of the Wrestler's menu item. 
 	> Cross Out that word.

RULEZ:
-Last Team with an Active Wrestler wins.
-When HP =<0 Cross Out that Wrestler.
 	>Inactive Wrestler becomes Active.
-THE PLAYER WITH THE LOWEST TOTAL HP IS ALWAYS THE ACTIVE PLAYER.
