Runner: Name and describe your avatar. One last push separates you and your target, a corporate server. What have you risked for this chance?

Architect: You designed three pieces of ICE, defensive programs, guarding this server. Describe one of each type:
		Type 		Examples 			Goal
		Obstacle 	wall, defender, tempest 	BLOCK
		Sentry		guards, trap, alarm 		ATTACK
		Enigma     	puzzle, illusion, maze 		CONFUSE
		
--------------------------------------------------------------
For each ICE:
-Architect describes it and the danger it poses. 
-Runner initiates an ICEbreaker, detailing its appearance and function. Share a memory related to its creation or use.
-Each ICE gives three chances to win successes. Narrate each success gained or lost together, blow by blow.

Obstacle: Roll a d6, success on 3+. Make three rolls.
Sentry: Architect places 3d6 on a table. Runner flicks a d6 at each from 1 foot, success per hit.
Enigma: Architect takes 4d6, and hides 0-2. Runner guesses amount, then discard used dice and hide twice more. Success per correct guess.	

Successes		->	Outcome
0 			-> 	Run ends, with major consequences. 
1			-> 	Continue, with consequence.
2 			-> 	Continue.
3 			-> 	Continue, Runner gains new knowledge or improvements.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Run Completed: Architect describes the server's appearance. Runner reveals their target, and shares why it matters. What happens?
