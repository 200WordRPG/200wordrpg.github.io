It Came from Studio 9 is a GM-less RPG where 3-5 players are part of a crew making a B-Movie. The crew collaborates on the framework of a science fiction, horror, or adventure movie before producing a film in three acts. Players then choose one of the following roles in the movie's production:

Director (Required)
Location Scout
Lead Actor (Required)
Supporting Actor
Stunt Person

Players then film the scenes in each act (usually two or three) by taking turns to say what they're doing in each scene. If the action seems difficult, they must roll 2d6 to determine the result.

10+: Action is a success (Ex: Lead actor delivers a great performance)
7-9: Action is successful but there's a complication (Ex: Location Scout gets the beach they wanted but there's turtles everywhere)
6-: The movie has a disaster (Ex: Director couldn't get prop guns and actors now must fight killer birds with coat hangers)

After all three acts are completed, the movie is released and the group discusses if it was a huge success, box office bomb, or film that is so bad it's a cult classic.
