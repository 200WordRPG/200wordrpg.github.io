Setting: Cyber-70s. Reel-to-reel data centers in downtown, government component manufacturers, trucks carrying the bank's back-up tapes to cold storage, antique technology dealers, all possible targets.

Players are robot criminals. They have a skill, a negative trait, and a name.

Mechanics:
-Players get 5 quarters (coins).
-Players flip quarters to perform checks.
-Binary. Heads = 1. Tails = 0.

Example:
| 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  0 |  1 |

-Players can flip as many of their coins as they want.
-If above check, success. If exact number, critical success.
-If below check, failure. If all coins flipped, critical failure, lose a quarter.
-Quarters can be traded, wagered, or stolen in-game.

Session:
Characters meet each other before the heist, introduce themselves, and create a plan.

During this phase, the GM plays the role of a Kingpin. The players form the plan by asking the Kingpin questions about the mark, to which the GM responds honestly.

Players should have a comprehensive plan, and perform checks to acquire the equipment their plan requires.

Before the heist begins, the GM chooses 3 details of the plan and performs checks to see how accurate they are.

The heist begins when all players agree they are ready.
