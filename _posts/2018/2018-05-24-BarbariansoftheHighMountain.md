You are barbarians! Raid enemy holdings for the glory of your clan.

  -Characters-
Describe your character. The GM uses the description to determine your strengths
and weaknesses. Strengths subtract a level of difficulty for checks that involve
them, weaknesses add a level.

As barbarians, you each start with a bone mace(-1 attack difficulty) and natural
toughness(+1 opponent attack difficulty). Additional items may be acquired 
throughout play.

  -Difficulty-
The GM determines the difficulty of an action. Difficulty ranges from effortless(-3)
to arduous(+3). Outside this range automatically succeeds or fails.

Average(0) is a d6 roll. For each difficulty-level outside average, roll another d6.
Above normal, take the lowest. Below normal, take the highest. Rolls succeed on 4 or
higher.

  -Combat-
Each turn you can attack and move up to 30'. Target a body-part at +1 difficulty or 
select randomly, then roll to hit.

2d6
2.......Head
3-4.....Left-Leg
5.......Left-Arm
6-8.....Torso
9.......Right-Arm
10-11...Right-Leg
12......Head

Body-parts become mutilated at 4 injuries. Each injury adds difficulty for that 
body-part (-5' movement for legs). When the torso or head are
mutilated, you are slain. A body-part suffers two injuries on a 6.

I would like to make an expanded version and I'm already well into a sci-fi RPG that makes use of some of these rules. Stay tuned!
