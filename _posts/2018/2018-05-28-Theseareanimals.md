One player, one GM.

Player: you are seven. You were with your mother, travelling to a new place, but suddenly there were men in uniform, shouting, and she screamed and they took her away. You don't know why. You don't know where she is. 

Now you are in a car. You don't know where you're going. There is one other person in the car. (This is the GM.) You have never seen them before. They do not speak your language.

Player: put a die in a cup and turn the cup upside down. This is your situation. The higher the number, the worse it is. You don't know what it is because you can't see the die.

GM: look at the die. Behave accordingly, or not. You're just driving the player somewhere. But you must prevent the player from seeing the number on the die. 

The game ends if the player sees the die or if the GM touches the player. The GM now reveals the number and describes what happens at the end of the journey. 

The player is reunited with their mother if the GM lifts the cup and the die has disappeared.
