"It's a Hologram" is a collaborative combat card game (CCCG) for four or more players - all you need is a standard deck of playing cards.

Begin by shuffling the deck and dealing one card to each player until no cards remain. The player whose last name is alphabetically first starts the game, playing any of their cards face-up on the table and saying an attack: "I strike with my blade," "I cast Dank Cloud," etc. Any first-turn attack is valid so long as the group deems it a "level 1 attack" by their metric.

The player to the right goes next, playing face-up any card that is immediately above or below the previous card in numerical or royal value. After saying "Ay!", the player must then say how they counter the previous attack: "I block with my shield," "I cast Soul Barrier," etc. Any counter-attack is valid so long as the group deems it not to be a gross overreaction to the previous attack.

No attack or counter-attack can be used more than once! Therein lies the rub!

Players are eliminated as they run out of cards, and the game ends when no cards remain. There is no win condition.
