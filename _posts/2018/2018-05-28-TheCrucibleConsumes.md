A three-player game.

You stand at the threshold.
You prepared for this, but cannot predict all that lies ahead.

Player1: What looms before you? (A warlock's tower / A cold steel arcology / An impenetrable fortress)
Player2: What must you do here? (Rescue them / Procure the artefact / Raze the inner sanctum)
Player3: Why are you prepared to die here today?

This is the point of no return.

=============
Setup
=============
Place a d4 ("the CLOCK") in the center, showing 3.
Each player gets 3 tokens.

=============
On your turn
=============
Narrate until a challenge/obstacle is encountered.

The player to your left ("L") describes our hero's approach.

The player to your right ("R") expends tokens to decide the outcome:
- Burn two: Success
- Burn one: Marginal success
- Burn none: Failure
- Gain one: Bitter failure

You narrate the result:
- Failure:
    - Sinking deeper...
    - The CLOCK ticks down. Drops below 1? **Game over!**  You: Describe how our hero is consumed.
                                                             R: What is their final thought?
                                                             L: Who will remember them?
- Success:
    - Hope glimmers...
    - The CLOCK ticks up (capped at 4)
- Marginal success / bitter failure:
    - As above, plus state a complicating or escalating TWIST

Now, it's the player to your left's turn. They must integrate any TWIST into their narration.

## Author Comments 

The main idea is to encourage the players to willingly engage with the inevitable mixture of failure that's baked into the system, taking on a more directorial / story-teller kind of role, creating a journey filled with ups-and-downs as opposed to a meteoric rise to success.

I think it's interesting to explore different ideas of what players in a game should actually be making choices about - here, the focus is on deciding if (and to what extend) a character's approach works, rather then on what the action itself should be. The die/token economy enforces some kind of dramatic pacing. It's up to the players to decide when/if the hero is victorious, or if failure is ultimately inevitable.

Based on mechanics alone (stripping away the thematic prompts), it tends to end up in a bit of a farce or comedy of errors, and works especially well for things like a heist or fairytale quest, which are structured as a straightforward "gauntlet" of obstacles. I've attempted to create a different atmosphere with the fluff/flavour here.
