You'll need many d6s

SETUP:
You're stealing an ITEM:
- What/where/whose is it?

Roll 8d6. STACK dice 4+ in centre of table. 

Pick a number from 2-5:
- Low = techie
- High = talker

Introduce yourself.


GET IN:
Players take turns.

Active player rolls 1d6:
- Even = TECH COMPICATION (CCTV, sensors, etc)
- Odd = TALK COMPICATION (guards, check-points, etc)

Roll 1d6 for DIFFICULTY.

Active player introduces COMPICATION.
Write down COMPICATION and DIFFICULTY.

In turn order, players say how they assist and roll 1d6:
- TECH COMPICATION -> roll higher than your number
- TALK COMPICATION -> roll lower than your number

Continue until SUCESSES = DIFFICULTY

Failed rolls add to the STACK. 

If the STACK falls, the jig's up.
The player who knocked the STACK is caught. Explain how.
Other players grab as many d6s from the STACK as they can and GET OUT.

Overcome six complications and you get the ITEM.
Evenly divide the dice from the STACK. Then GET OUT.


GET OUT:
Working back through complications, players roll their dice.
Dice less than DIFFICULTY are lost.

Players with dice continue.
Players with no dice are caught. Explain how.

Players with dice remaining after final complication escape.
Explain how and their life afterwards.
