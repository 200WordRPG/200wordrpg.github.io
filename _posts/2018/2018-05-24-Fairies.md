```
Choose a fairy - tooth fairy, animal fairy, garden fairy.
Spread 50 notes on bus stops, waiting rooms and restaurants, saying thanks: for tooths, for taking care of a pet, for keeping a garden.
On the note, leave an email address.

For every answer to your email, send a gift (a coin, a kitten photo, a flower) and thank them for still believing.

For every answer to that send them the game, while recruiting them to be a fairy and schedule a picnic in a public park, on a given date, to everyone that's willing to attend and bring some friends and family.

Sparkle and shine as you deserve and prepare a costume party!
