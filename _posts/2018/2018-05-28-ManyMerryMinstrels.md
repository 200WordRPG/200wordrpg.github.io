## Author Comments 

I've always wanted to make a game about poetry! My biggest goal was to inspire people to work together in their creativity, just like Minstrels sitting around the tavern fire.

If you play with friends but are hesitant in your poetry skills I strongly suggest using online tools like https://www.rhymezone.com and http://www.thesaurus.com/ to keep words flowing. You can also check out a version with more pictures and examples on my itch page: https://sethpaxton.itch.io/many-merry-minstrels
