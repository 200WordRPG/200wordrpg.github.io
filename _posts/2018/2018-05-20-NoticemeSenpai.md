What you'll need: letter-making materials, and friends.

The roles

Senpai: you do nothing but exist. You're seemingly ordinary but all the kawaii kouhais think you're pretty kakui. They're lined up to cheer you up. So Sit back, exist, and enjoy some sweet love letter action.

Kouhais: There's several kind of kouhais. (See below). All of you are absolutely enthralled with Senpai. You want nothing more for him to recognize the unrequited love you send him and cheer him up when he's in despair.

The Rules
This is a love letter making game. Whoever last wrote a handwritten letter gets to be the Senpai first. The rest then pick a kouhai and write their love letter to Senpai. When all letters arrive, the previous Senpai chooses the next one. This can continue for as long as you like! There is no win scenario or anything like that. The only real rule is that all letters must be written in the style of the kouhai the player chose.

Types of kouhai:
Tsundere
Yandere
Dandere
Kuudere
Deredere
Himedere/oujidere
Kamidere
Sadodere

If you want to be random about it roll a d8...baka.
