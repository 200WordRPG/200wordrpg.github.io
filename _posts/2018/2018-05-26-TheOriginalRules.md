- a double spaced, printed copy of the rules

Create a character or use an existing one. On paper:

ON YOUR TURN:

- Describe how your character resolves the Challenge.
- Narrate how circumstances escalate, posing a new Challenge.
- [The player on your left] goes next.


RESOLVING CHALLENGES:

When you resolve the Challenge in a way that could fail interestingly [roll 2d6]. If your description suggests an advantage, and everyone agrees, [add +1 to the roll].

- [7 or higher] is considered a [success].
- [6 or lower] is considered a [failure].
- When you [roll doubles], [cross out a bracketed section] and [add one or two new bracketed sections anywhere].
