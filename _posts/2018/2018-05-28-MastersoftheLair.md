MASTERS OF THE LAIR

You need one d6 die, pencils, index cards, readiness to do evil.

You inhibit a dungeon of some kind. Each player (2-6 players) creates a creature of evil.

Each player discreetly writes down something about the Lair on an index card. It may be dangerous or weird. You reveal cards and put them together, creating a common evil place. Your lair. From here you will spread your evil.

Let your reign of mischief begin: One of the players, anyone, the fastest or the boldest, maybe, takes action and declares the next Evil Undertaking. Undertakings could be: steal something from another lairmaster, build a suicidal and ingenious trap, tame a monster, hoard treasures, venture into the Goodlands and bring evil, explore new parts of the lair, defend your lair.

Other players roll dice: player with lowest roll creates misery and problems for the undertaking. The player with the highest roll facilitates the story, fills the gaps and gamemasters the current undertaking. All players go on their undertaking together. Conflicts of any kind are resolved by d6 rolls (1: catastrophe, 2-3: success at cost, 4-5: success, 6: success drawing attention).

After that, the next undertaking.
