You are a marginalised person.

You may be: not cisgender, not straight, not white, not ablebodied, not neurotypical, not middle class or higher, and/or not male.

Roll 1d6. Your roll determines how many ways you are marginalised. Choose from the above list, or determine your own. In all other ways you are privileged.

Consider what you have done today in real life. Now, imagine that you are the marginalised character that you have created, and you are attempting to complete the same tasks. Describe your character's day as a diary entry to other players or, if playing alone, write them down.

Participate in this over a real life week with the same character. The following week, roll new characters and start over.
