In which 3-6 players squabble over the fate of a single hero. The players in Volition are a pantheon of fickle gods throwing challenges in the path of a mortal hero.

Begin by building a world together, each player should pick a genre, theme or interesting detail. The last player gets to name our hero.

Each player has a secret objective, a word chosen from the hero reaction table and written on a piece of paper.

Turn sequence rotates clockwise. The active player must describe a brief scene involving our hero and then roll on the hero reaction table, this roll result will influence the next player. The next player must continue the story, describing the next scene while incorporating the hero reaction and then rolling again for the next player and so on. A scene ends when the reaction roll has been resolved.

Players win by using their secret objective to kill our hero.
