* You're planets around a dying sun. Mankind has come to call you home. You'd rather be alone. *


|| Players: choose d12s. Their planets. Name, describe them. Use colors as inspiration.


|| Place d20, 10 up, at center. The sun.


|| Roll d12s around sun = Planet Tags (PT). Create:
-- Atmosphere [gases, weather, moons]
-- Surface [flora, fauna, landscape]
-- Core [minerals, geological threats]


|| Grab [players -1] d4s. Mankind spaceships. 
-- Roll = Spaceship Supply (SS)
-- Lowest SS closest to outermost planet.



=================
==== Planets ====
=================

>>> Target spaceship and:

--> Summon comet: roll d8. If < = SS; SS-1 (if SS = 0, spaceship explodes). 


--> Summon asteroids: roll d10. Resolve as above. If > SS, asteroids stay around. [Opt: -1 as action. If becomes < = SS, resolve as above].


--> Use tag: if spaceship on planet, roll d6. Resolve as above. 

[Opt: Scratch a tag for:
Bonus: | -1 | -2 | -3 
current PT: |9+ | 5-8 | 4-]


--> Orbit: rotate planets. All SS +1. Sun +1.




==================
=== Spaceships ===
==================

>>> SS-1. Move closer to planet. If:

--> Already 1; land on planet. 
--> Already on planet; SS+1 and PT-1 (player: scratch a tag). 
--> Landed and SS = 4; sprout new spaceship and SS resets to 1.




=================
====== Sun ======
=================

>>> Sun +1. 

--> On 13, 16, 18, 20: sun engulfs closest planet. 




||| Goal: destroy all spaceships before sun reaches 20. |||

## Author Comments 

The concept of playing as a planet has haunted me for a while. I'm really fond of the idea of having inanimate objects as characters. The planets don’t have civilization or intelligent beings. I’d like it to be played with players describing how their resources are exploited by humans and how their landscape changes, and although destruction is inevitable, they want to have it their way. Oh, and I had a lot of fun describing my colorful d12s as if they were planets. I hope you enjoy it!
