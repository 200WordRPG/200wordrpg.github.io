Players take role of a Psychotherapist and a Client.

CHARACTER CREATION:

Psychotherapist:
Attitude - Choose 1 and roll for 1 (reroll doubles)
Problem - roll for 1

Client:
Problem - roll for 2 (reroll doubles)

Keep results hidden.

ATTITUDE

GAMEPLAY

Roll D6 to establish number of sessions.
Roll D3 before the session to see how many rounds it lasts.

Each round, psychotherapist and client roll-off a D6.
Apply modifiers, where each "+ " adds 1 to score, "-" subtracts 1. Compare results.

Role-play using attitude and problems. Keep track of win/lose score.

After the last round, sum the score. Session is:
- successful (therapist won) - remove one random problem from client
- unsuccessful (client won) - add one random problem to client
- no progress (draw) - stays the same.

AFTER EACH SESSION

Roll D6 and modify result by +1/-1/0 if the session was successful/unsuccessful/no progress respectfully.

If result is 3 or lower, add another random problem to therapist.
If therapist has more problems than client - switch roles.

GAME GOAL: Resolve all client problems.
BONUS: Name each other's problems.
