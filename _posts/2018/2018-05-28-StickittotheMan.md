```
Requires tokens, paper, 3-5 players.

SETUP

One player is The Man.

- Who are you?
- What do you want?

The others are the Rebels.

- Why do you resist?
- Did you have a chance or choice?
- What will you do?
- What won't you do?

When you hurt The Man, you create Consequence.

Each Rebel has an Approach. Ask The Man:

- The Hurt (3,6,9)
- The Refresh (1,2,3)
- The Consequence (3,6,9)

What is your Goal (recommended 30)

Start with 0 Consequence tokens, and 5 Influence tokens.

PLAY

Ask The Man, "What's going on?"

He'll describe, including:

- Target
- Risk and Reward (Consequence and Influence gain or loss)

The Man bids a hidden Challenge: Target + waged Consequence.

Choose a Rebel to bid Effort: Hurt + waged Influence.

Rebel wins if Effort exceeds the Challenge.

Winner tells result. Losers shut their piehole.

- Add/Subtract Consequence and Influence.
- Add Consequence from Approach.
- Take used Approach to zero.
- Refresh used Approaches, usable again when recharged to Hurt.
- Fix Influence- you can't use or lose it.

ENDGAME

If the Rebels's non-fixed Influence goes below zero, they are crushed. The Man tells what happens.

If their Influence exceeds the Goal and is higher than current Consequence they win and tell how.
