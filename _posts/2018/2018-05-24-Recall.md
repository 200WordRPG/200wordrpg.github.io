2 players
A deck
Pens
Paper

A message echoes. A distant reply. Perhaps a hope.
Each needs what the other has.
Neither knows who the other is, but do what they must.

===============================================================

Extract from a deck of cards a stack of Aces(1), Twos, Threes, and two Fives.
Shuffle this stack together.
Deal five cards from this stack to each player; set the remainder aside.
Cards represent energy, materials, fuel, etc.

Players begin 18u apart.

===============================================================

Define u. A mile? A league? A light year?
Define a turn. An hour? A day? A decade?
Define player characters. Bandit impersonating a savior? Distress beacon as bait?

Each turn:
- Both PCs may play one card and move up to that many u forwards or backwards.
- Black cards are memories. Red cards are obstacles.
- Both PCs create a respective entry in his/her personal journal; frame the scene or tell an anecdote.
- Communicate. Or don't.

Continue until at least one player empties his/her hand.
If PCs do not meet, resolve the story.
If PCs meet, reveal PCs and resolve the story.
If a contest/fight occurs, each player may play one card. Higher wins.

One more entry, then share journals.

Inspired by every single time those FTL distress beacons turns out to be a lurking pirate. But what else can we do with a rendezvous?
