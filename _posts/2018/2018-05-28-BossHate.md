Each player rolls D20 - highest roll is Game Master, second highest is BossHater. Rest are zombie-slaves. Maximum game duration is two hours. 

BossHater: you waste 7+1D6 hours of your life as a (roll D10 - "Profession"). You waste that time in a (roll D10 - "Place of Work"). Your boss is a (roll D8 - "Attribute") caricature of a person. Convert zombie-slaves (see below) to BossHaters and kill your boss. 

Zombie-slave: try to convince the BossHater of the folly of her ways. Roll as a BossHater, but select D4 "Excuses". 

GM: Set the scene and background; use D12 + situational modifiers for conflict
