2-4 people.
Paper and pencils.
The internet.
Glue sticks or clear tape.

You play a NORMAL family decorating your house with your favorite things.

Say who you are:
THE MOMMY, THE DADDY, THE BABY, THE DOG.

Say your personal favorite thing:
GLITTER, THE COLOR HOT PINK, FLY FISHING, GREEN SHAG CARPET, GEORGE WASHINGTON.

Pick a room to decorate together:
THE KITCHEN, THE FAMILY ROOM, A BEDROOM, THE FRONT YARD.

Draw the empty room. You can add FEATURES like a lawn or windows. Now, go on the INTERNET. Take turns finding pictures of your favorite things and save them to a MOOD BOARD. This is your AESTHETIC.

Say whether or not you think a favorite thing truly embodies your family's AESTHETIC. Veto middle-ground objects, outlier objects, unfamiliar objects. Push your family to THINK BIGGER and KEEP THE AESTHETIC.

Each family member picks 5 or so objects. Don't worry about where they'll go. Print your MOOD BOARD and cut out your objects. Negotiate their PLACEMENT. Paste your objects around the room.

When satisfied, admire your room.

Whose AESTHETIC won?
How do you think you STEREOTYPED?
How do you JUDGE other people's favorite things?
