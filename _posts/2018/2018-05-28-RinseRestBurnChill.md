CHECK IN:
This is a game about spending the night in a spa.
Each player introduces their character by NAMING them, EXPLAINING why they're at the spa, and SETTING a goal for the night.
Explanations include, but are not limited to, loneliness, boredom, shelter, and lust.

SPA RULES:
The game lasts five rounds, each round representing two hours at the spa, starting at 8 p.m.
Each round, each player will select a location to visit. Each player rolls 1d6. Players pick locations based on the die roll, going lowest to highest.
If multiple players pick the same location, they share a scene. If a player is alone at a location, they share something they see, something they do, or something they dream.
At the end of round, each player rolls 1d6. On a 1, something special happened. On a 6, something weird happened. Player describes what happened.

LOCATIONS:
The Showers. (Closed rounds three and four.)
The Beds. (Closed rounds one and two.)
The Saunas. (Always open.)
The Baths. (Closed rounds three and four.)

CHECK OUT:
At the end of round five, players reflect on their character's night.
Did they meet their goal? Do they have any regrets?

The mind wanders when you're sitting in a recliner in a dark room full of strangers trying to fall asleep. I know why I'm there, but I always wonder what is going through everyone else's minds. I've seen all sorts at the spa in the middle of the night- from the very young to the very old, from the party crew to the lonely male. It takes all sorts, you know?
