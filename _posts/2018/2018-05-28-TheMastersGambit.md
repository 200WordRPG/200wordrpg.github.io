The Master reads this to themselves, hidden from the Apprentice.

Years ago, your master betrayed you. Find Apprentice to use in enacting vengeance.
- List preparatory missions.
- What if you are discovered by your target?
- How will you get Apprentice on your side? Ask: Living situation, aspirations, foe/rival?

Master has 4 dice in the Forms: Circle/Triangle/Rectangle. Apprentice has 0. Your target will have 6.

Name a Form to describe actions. "I CIRCLE around them," "I make a TRIANGULAR three-pronged attack," "I open the SQUARE chest."
- Master declares difficulty (1 - 5).
- Actor rolls Form's dice (d6), Master rolls extra dice for advantage.
- Narrate success per die > difficulty.
- New understanding demonstrated, # Dice < 6: Master may award die.

Before a mission, train through example. Once ready, light the Cambra Root to control Apprentice. Lead to next objective. Frame as safely honing skills through "vision quest."
- Snap fingers to awaken, send on mission. Help when necessary, then disappear.
- Mission accomplished, snap fingers to put them under. Take them home to sleep.
- Explain away any signs their "vision" was real.

Accompany Apprentice on final mission. As you take revenge, Apprentice realises what you've done. Fight, die, or escape and the cycle repeats.

I was inspired by the classic kung fu movie trope of the obtuse Master teaching the clueless Apprentice to wax-on-wax-off. I liked the dynamic of one person knowing so much and trying to get another to understand what they're teaching them.
