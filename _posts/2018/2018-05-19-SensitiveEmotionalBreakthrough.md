Each player is a disembodied emotion in search of validation. Fill a whimsically-decorated serving dish with macaroons. Each player gets a box of tissue.

Take turns talking about which emotion you are. If someone cries, they get to take another turn. Everyone else eats a macaroon.

When you're all done talking about your emotions, look out the window. If it's still daytime, the person who cried the most gets another turn. If it's nighttime, the tallest player gets to sing a song and everyone else eats a macaroon.

The game ends when there are no more macaroons. Group hug; you're all winners.

Fin.
