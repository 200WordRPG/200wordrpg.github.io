You don't live here.

EIGHT: You've been in this house before. If you don't remember it, describe it. If you do, say how things have changed. Notice the photos of strangers that line the walls.

SEVEN: You hear activity in another room. Investigate. What banal thing are these strangers doing? Try to get their attention by (pick 1): causing a chill, misplacing something, whispering through static. Why don't they notice you?

SIX: A door slams. It's your ex-lover. If you seek him out, say how and proceed. If not, go back to SEVEN. 

FIVE: You see two people: your ex-lover and a stranger. You haven't seen your ex-lover recently. What new thing do you notice about him? The stranger sees you and screams.

FOUR: Your ex-lover is (pick 1): crying, muttering, raging. What does he say?

THREE: Try to talk him down. What do you say? It never works. Describe his gun as he pulls it out.

TWO: Do you threaten to leave? If so, say it and proceed. If not, go back to SEVEN. 

ONE: Why were you leaving him? Does the bullet hurt? Describe the darkness. Is it warm? Cold? Regretful? Vengeful? Everything disappears. Go back to EIGHT.
