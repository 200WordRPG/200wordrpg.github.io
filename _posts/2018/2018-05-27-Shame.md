```
Take off your clothes. Dim the lights and draw the curtains.

Find two coins. Lie flat on your back on the floor before carefully placing each of the coins over each of your closed eyelids. Count to ten. Breathe deeply.

Something happened to you.

Where is the pain?

HEAD (Accusation)
THROAT (Secret)
HEART (Trauma)
BELLY (Regret)
GROIN (Disgrace)
LEGS (Contempt)

Toss a coin to your left.

HEADS
Rehearse a grandiose and arrogant reaction to your shame.
Spent a moment demanding envy and appreciation.

TAILS
You're oversensitive, hypervigilant, easily hurt.
Spent a moment accusing someone of being abusive toward you.

Stop here if you want to win the internet.

Now lean to your right to toss the second coin.

HEADS
Relive the MEMORY that caused your shame. Now suppress it: bury it deep down inside yourself. Your shame is contagious every time you become angry. 

TAILS
Relax into the pain in your BODY. Rationalise the pain: it's just a sensation. Your shame is contagious every time you think of another person as being inherently bad.

Unless you choose differently.

Take ten deep breaths. Put on your clothes, draw the curtains; go outside. Every naked piece of you is beautiful.
