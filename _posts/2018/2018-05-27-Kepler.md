Roll 18d6. Each die's a Challenge; each number, its difficulty.
Players agree on a Challenge's difficulty and select an appropriate die from the pool. To face a Challenge, spend Funding (start with 18) one-for-one for dice to roll against it, taking the highest result.

## Author Comments 

I don't want to explain what this game is about or what it means because I feel like that's the job of the players, to discover their own meaning in games, but I will say a few things:

This game owes a lot to the fourth season of Friends at the Table. I've read lots of books and seen plenty of movies, but no creative work has ever affected me in the way that Friends at the Table does. The reverence the Friends have for their characters, the passion with which they represent and discuss queer and racial politics in and out of character, and the love they have for one another is moving and refreshing. I wouldn't have done this without them.

If you played this game and liked it/hated it/felt neutral about it, tweet at me! This was my first time designing a game, and I had a lot of fun, so I'd love to get advice on what worked or didn't work in case I end up writing more!

Thanks to Joshua Flores from the Fans at the Table Facebook group for reading through my game and giving me Confidence Alive to post it, good luck on your submission!
Thanks to David Schirduan for polishing up Kintsugi, posting it on itch.io, and name-dropping this challenge, else I would've never heard of it. 
Thanks to my gaming group for being ready for anything.
And thanks to my girlfriend for making my write That Gay Shit. 

These comments are probably longer than the game itself, but thanks for reading them too! I hope you enjoy Kepler! Thank you!
