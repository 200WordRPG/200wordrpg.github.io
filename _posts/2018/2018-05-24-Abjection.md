I'm the Judge.
To my right stands the Prosecutor, whose goal is to convict a suspect.
To the left is the Lawyer defending them.


Prosecutor, you begin by writing two Facts - short, factual sentences like
[The victim was killed by a spear].
Then you both draw 5 cards from a shuffled 52-card deck.

At each turn :
-  Draw a card.
-  Play one (or more) face-down card, take a deep breath and
   yell...
   ____  _     _           _   _               _ 
  / __ \| |   (_)         | | (_)             | |
 | |  | | |__  _  ___  ___| |_ _  ___  _ __   | |
 | |  | | '_ \| |/ _ \/ __| __| |/ _ \| '_ \  | |
 | |__| | |_) | |  __/ (__| |_| | (_) | | | | |_|
  \____/|_.__/| |\___|\___|\__|_|\___/|_| |_| (_)
             _/ |                                
            |__/                                

If you played : 


     > One JQKA-card : Add a new Fact.
       I'll check if it doesn't contradict the others Facts.
       [The suspect was seen holding a spear]
 
     > One (or more) Heart-card : For each card, add, delete or change exactly one letter in a Fact.
       I'll decide if the updated Fact is meaningful.
       [The suspect was seen holding a *pear]

If you think your shady opponent is bluffing, you can reveal their face-down cards by shouting... 

           _     _           _   _               _ 
     /\   | |   (_)         | | (_)             | |
    /  \  | |__  _  ___  ___| |_ _  ___  _ __   | |
   / /\ \ | '_ \| |/ _ \/ __| __| |/ _ \| '_ \  | |
  / ____ \| |_) | |  __/ (__| |_| | (_) | | | | |_|
 /_/    \_\_.__/| |\___|\___|\__|_|\___/|_| |_| (_)
               _/ |                                
              |__/                                


If they're indeed cheating, the effect is canceled and you draw a card. Otherwise, they draw two.

I'll deliver my verdict after the Lawyer's tenth turn :
-  The suspect is guilty if linked to a [Murder Weapon], has 
   a [Mobile] and no [Alibi].
-  Otherwise, they're free.


           _ _     _____  _            _ 
     /\   | | |   |  __ \(_)          | |
    /  \  | | |   | |__) |_ ___  ___  | |
   / /\ \ | | |   |  _  /| / __|/ _ \ | |
  / ____ \| | |   | | \ \| \__ \  __/ |_|
 /_/    \_\_|_|   |_|  \_\_|___/\___| (_)
                                         
                                       

Court is now in session.
