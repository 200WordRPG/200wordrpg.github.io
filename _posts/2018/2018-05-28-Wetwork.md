Players play as Assassins or Targets. Assassins want to kill all Targets. Targets want to fend off assassins. 

Players pour themselves Water, Caffeine, or Alcohol. 


A player's drink determines their character's archetype:

Caffeine - Clever Assassin: +1 to rolls involving smarts
Alcohol -  Erratic Assassin: +1 to rolls involving force
Water -  Target: +1 to rolls involving self-defense


Player drinking the strongest caffeine is the Leader, they describe each scene, and set goals for Assassins/Targets. They still play their character.

Players drinking water (or the weakest drink) are a Target. Targets have guards and resources. They describe obstacles and complications in the scene.

Player drinking the strongest alcohol acts first when a new scene begins.


Roll 1d6 for uncertain actions:

6 Succeeds
4-5 Succeeds for a price (determined by Leader for Targets, determined by Targets for Assassins)
1-3  Fails (and rolling player drinks)


If a player uses the bathroom, their character is suddenly in life-threatening danger (described by Leader).  Players can attempt to save that character before the player comes back. If they don't, that character dies.

If a player finishes their drink, their character dies.

Game ends when all targets are dead, or all assassins are dead.


Cheers!
