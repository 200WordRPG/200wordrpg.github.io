SYSTEM
You narrate collaboratively with your friends while you drink in a pub, stories in a post - apocalyptic land.
You will define gambling, which generated the events that almost wiped out life on earth.
Each master/player narrates a piece of the story and then passes the narration to the next master/player with the phrase: Fuck there!

GOLDEN RULE
Who does not have a glass in his hand loses his turn.

CREATION OF CHARACTER
They are divided into 3 attributes: Physical, social and intellect, they are assigned priorities, distributing points: 3, 2, 1.

Examples:
The bully of the school and the most popular:
Physicist | Social | Intellect
    3                2             1

The  MMA champion:
Physicist | Social | Intellect
    3                1             2


DISPUTE OF ATTRIBUTES
When there are scenes in which an attribute dispute is required, one of the players may ask "get hands dirty'" and the players play odds or evens, and can not put zero.
The difference between the values placed by the two players is verified and the difference is added to the attribute value of the caller.
In the case of a tie, who called for a hand wins.

The game is over when everyone is drunk or dead!
