This game is dedicated to native tribes, cultures, and peoples around the world whose lands and ways of life have been forever changed by exploitation and greed. I cannot pretend to understand the pain that has been experienced, but I can care about it. My hope is that this game will inspire its players to become involved in finding a solution and mending the wounds of the past.
