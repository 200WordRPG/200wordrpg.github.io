"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also ... And the Lord said unto Satan, 'Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?' " 

"Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, 'Doth Job fear God for nought?' "   Job 1:6-9
