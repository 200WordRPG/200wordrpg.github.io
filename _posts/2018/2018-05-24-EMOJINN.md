EMOJINN
Hello, World.
You cannot play Emojinn by yourself.
You need a friend with a phone.
Text them using emoji.
Tell them where they are with a place or other emoji.
Text them the ? emoji to get their response.
Use the !! emoji to warn them of danger.
Use the X emoji to say NOPE. Use the check emoji to say YEP.
They can look around or use their other senses.
They can find treasures, weapons, magic items and allies.
Will they gain magic and riches?
Or will they meet their doom?
When they text, check your time.
If the minute is odd, they failed.
If the minute is even, they succeeded.
Play until done.
