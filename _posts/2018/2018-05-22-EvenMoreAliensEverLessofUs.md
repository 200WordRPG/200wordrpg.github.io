```
Twelve marines are trying to reach an escape shuttle. Scan blips are increasing.

Divide the marines among the players. Give each marine a catchphrase.

(N-) means "roll 1d6, on 1-N keep that result (success), otherwise result is 0 (failure)".

COMBATS:
Describe how the marines are fighting back. Each one kills (2-) aliens.
Then, one random marine dies for each alien left. Survivors fight another round.
Once per game, a marine can kill (4-) aliens instead of (2-) by yelling his catchphrase.
Likewise, a marine can kill 1d6 aliens by sacrificing himself.

NON-COMBAT ACTIONS:
Test (2-), or (4-) for a colorful and appropriate description.

STORYLINE:

RESIDENTIAL AREA
Ambushed by 3d6 aliens

PASSAGEWAYS
1d6+1 aliens attack from the front and 1d6+1 from behind. Only two marines can fire each way, but only they may die that round.

SHUTTLEBAY
Three waves of 2d6, 2d6, and 4d6 aliens
Each wave, any marine that doesn't fight can test (2-) to find a functioning shuttle (allowing "takeoff" after current wave).

TAKEOFF
3d6 aliens attack the shuttle.
Only marines accepting to stay behind can fight. If they all die, the shuttle crashes.
