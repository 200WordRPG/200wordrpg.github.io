This is a narrative game about long distances, explorations, revelations and self knowledge in a space travel.

You need:

2 peoples. (A GM and a player)
2 smarthphones (with instant mensseger)
Sincerity, sensitivity and creativity


The Mechanical:

The international phone number of player represents the travel.

[5] [5] [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [0]

From first to last, one by one, each number represents a result for the travel narrative.

GM ask and the player answer with the next number.

9 or 0 you're ok
6-8 is ok, but it's complicated. Why?
5- The truth is terrible


Modifying results:

The player may include aspects of your real life in fiction to gain +1 in your result.


The first question for this game:

You're on a lonely space travel. What do you search?

[Player answer]

Example: My travel is a search from the past [result: 5] [because i'm a historian: +1 = 6]


From the results, continue describing and asking:

What's around?
What's it?
Where are the old crew?
Where are you going?
Who're you?
Who's that?
and others...


After the last number, you two describe the arrival and talk about this travel.
