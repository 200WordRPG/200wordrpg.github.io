This should work with no adjustment with almost any B/X, OD&D, AD&D, or OSR adventure. Like those systems, this is intended to be the structure on which a referee makes rulings. It's not an all-encompassing solution because the referee is expected to make rulings to suit the game he/she is running and the group that is playing.

Example spell: Still Wood might be interpreted to close and lock doors.
