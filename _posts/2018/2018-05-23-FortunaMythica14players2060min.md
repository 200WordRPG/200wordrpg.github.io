Separate playing cards into three piles: faces, red numbers, and black numbers.

One player is the 'Reader'.  The other's' are the protagonist's'.  Protagonists start by drawing a face as their character.

Hardships: Reader draws a face and improvises a Hardship based on the card's meaning.  Protagonists describe how they overcome it. 

Actions: Whenever protagonists describe contestable actions they take, draw a card from red and play it against one Reader draws from black.  Highest number wins, on tie redraw. A bigger numerical difference = greater result.

Players take actions until Reader decides the Hardship is resolved and next Hardship is drawn.

Protagonists: may force a redraw from their character card's color deck once per game.
Jacks get +1 to one draw per Hardship.
Queens get +3 to one draw once per game.
Kings can draw 1 additional card once per game.
Aces can force a Hardship redraw once per game.
