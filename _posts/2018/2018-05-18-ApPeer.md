Got an important meeting and just can't get there? Don't waste your time with cyber-presence. Our hosts are waiting. Wearing special headbands linked to their phone, your face will appear over theirs. They see a real living person - no tiny screens, no being stuck to the wall. Make a "personal" appearance without leaving your couch. That's convenience. That's aPeer. 

Everyone finds a picture of a celebrity, about A4 size. Ideally one they admire. Cut it out of the magazine or advertisement or print it out. 

Gather. Pass your celebrity to the player to your left. 

Pick up the picture and hold it over your face. That person is now using your body through aPeer. Talk to the other celebrities. You're all at the same event, how exciting. Talk about how you don't normally use aPeer but there's a taxi strike, a fuel shortage or you had trouble finding a babysitter. They don't have a union but you always tip. 

Comment on how nice your aPeer host is. Perhaps the last one was a bit smelly or a bit fat?  Commiserate others if they got a fat one. 

Leave a comment for your aPeer host, and a rating out of five.

Obviously this is satire. Check in with people when you expose them to this kind of body critique (and indeed social critique). Don't use satire to be an ass.
