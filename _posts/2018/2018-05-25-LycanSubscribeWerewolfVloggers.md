If you're gonna be the next LOGAN PAWL, you'll need one stopwatch, and paper for each werewolf. Write down your vlog name. Mark 5 fans and 0 haters. 

	Introduce yourself and your vlog to the pack. Create a catchphrase.

	On your turn, choose a vlog type and start the stopwatch.  Vlog up to 2 minutes. Say "Cut" and stop the timer. You succeed if the rightmost digit on the stopwatch is 6+. If you discuss trending topics, succeed on 4+.  

Trending Topics
	-Fur Care
	-Howling Techniques
	-Moon Appreciation
	-Silver awareness
	-First transformation

You can capitalize on each trending topic once.

On a 9, +5 fans and create a new trending topic.



Vlog Types:

Bark - Everyday vlogging about werewolf life.
	Success: +3 Fans  
	Failure: +1 Hater

Howl - Wolfing out with daring stunts.
	Success:  Double Your Fans
	Failure: +8 Haters

Snarl - Accuse another vlogger with more fans of a scandal. 
	Success: +Fans equal to theirs
	Failure: +Fans equal to their haters

After vlogging, ANYONE may give you a "like" and +1 Fan.

	If you reach 50 fans, you're famous! 
If you have more haters than fans, they hire hunters to end your career. You may always start a new character and vlog.
