Divide the group into PLAYERS and JUDGES.

Make one index card each for:

   "AXIOM: rules must be no more than 200 words".
   "AXIOM: rules must describe a game".

Notecards represent the rules.

1. Give the rules to the players. Players must each obey the rules to
   produce a document that violates the SPIRIT of the rules.
2. Judges decide what went wrong. Each proposes a new rule change and
   judges vote whether or not to accept it, ties broken by coin flip.
   Any rule change must be one of: ADD A MUTABLE RULE, MAKE A MUTABLE
   RULE INTO AN AXIOM, MAKE AN AXIOM MUTABLE, or CHANGE MUTABLE RULE.
   Put new rules on a new notecard.

Repeat until exhausted, giving the ammended rules to the players each
time.

If all of the legal submissions suck, the players win. If one or more
of them is pretty good, the judges win.
