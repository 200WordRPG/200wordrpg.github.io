The war is over and a fascist officer has time to think before being hanged.
This is a two players game in which you are required to describe a situation, not the event itself.

Draw a circle in the centre of a white sheet, this will become the symbol of your fascism.
---
Victim: use a question from each list to set the scene, which must outline: where it is happening, who is the victim, what did they hope for (first list) and what is going to happen (second list).
Draw a new part of the symbol.

- When did you start believing in fascism?
- Why did you vote for them?
- How did you support the party?
- Why did you think the war was right?

Fascist: end the scene explaining how you, your soldiers and the victim got there and why, for the first time, you thought it was:

- necessary to silence a dissident
- imperative to kill
- important to execute a child
- right to rape

and you didn't prevent it.

Stain the symbol with drawings inspired by the scene.
---
Exchange roles, mark the used questions and continue till the last.
The fascists are hanged asking themselves: Was it worth it?
