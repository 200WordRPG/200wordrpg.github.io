This is a classic dungeon and you have 6 classes: Rogue, Ranger, Paladin, Sorcerer, Bard and Priest. 

You have a changing goal that begins with finding information in town and then moving from there into the dungeon to reach your goal.

But there is a twist, you can not Harm or Kill any enemies you encounter because you are a pacifist and it is a crime against your beliefs to do so. 

So you must use your skills like pickpocket to steal keys or Strength break open doors, Spells like Flash and Levitate to move around Monsters, weapons, Equipment like disguises or a lute to charm others ,and more to find your way around obstacles you encounter. It requires a game master to run the shops and NPCs and choose the objectives of your quest.

All players will start with 500 hundred gold to buys items and choose 3 class spells of their choice.

You can play this game with 2 to 7 players, letting you go on a solo run of this quest or making it a full party raid of the dungeons.

Now let's go on our quest in this Dungeon With a Twist.
