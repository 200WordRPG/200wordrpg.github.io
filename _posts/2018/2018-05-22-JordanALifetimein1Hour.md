Gather up to three other friends. You will narrate the life of Jordan.

Take a deck of cards and separate out one suit into the piles below the instructions.

Shuffle each pile face-down separately.

Each player takes turns drawing cards from the piles until they are depleted.

Narrate short but meaningful scenes for the associated card age as flashbacks, memories, or real time scenes involving the other players.

ANY cards drawn from the same pile AFTER a face card affect your life negatively.

When the Ace is drawn, your life comes to an end.
