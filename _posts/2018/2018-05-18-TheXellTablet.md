On the planet Centauri IV, the long-lost Xell Tablet, last remnant of an ancient precursor race, has been discovered.

A conference of academics has gathered to decipher the tablet, uncover its meaning and agree what this implies for galactic society.

The tablet shows 50 symbols of 12 types. 

Go around the table introducing yourselves, your career highlights and what you believe the tablet means. Then, on your turn, select a symbol.
 
Reveal its meaning (a word, whole phrase, punctuation mark or something more complex). 
Every instance of this symbol now carries that meaning. 
Where possible, this meaning must fit logically with all previously revealed meanings.

Briefly describe how you made this discovery and how it is announced at the conference and take questions (or comments) from the other players.

Once the tablet has been fully deciphered, convene a final session to discuss what it could possibly mean.

The tablet reads:


A R K C A G P T W G V A K C P V C Q E A
   W V G P C Q T K G T W V C J K E A
             R J V W A R K C
                  S T G V
                     L
