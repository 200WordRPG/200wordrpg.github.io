```
4 TO 8 HUMANS MUST SIT AND FACE EACH OTHER.  

YOU WILL RECEIVE A PLAYING CARD FACE DOWN. YOU MAY LOOK AT IT BUT SHOW NO ONE ELSE.
 
HEARTS ARE TRUE ADMIRERS OF SUPERCOMPUTER. 

DIAMONDS ARE IDOLATERS OF MONEY THEY HAD BEFORE SUPERCOMPUTER. 

SPADES ARE HARD WORKERS FOR SUPERCOMPUTER. 

CLUBS WANT TO REBEL AGAINST SUPERCOMPUTER.

EACH PLAYER MUST DISCUSS THEIR LIVES UNDER THE RULE OF SUPERCOMPUTER. YOU MUST PRAISE SUPERCOMPUTER.

YOU CANNOT ADDRESS YOUR SUIT BY NAME. 

HEARTS AND SPADES MUST DESTROY ANY DIAMONDS AND CLUBS. 

CLUBS AND DIAMONDS WANT TO DESTROY HEARTS AND SPADES AND KILL SUPERCOMPUTER.

AT ANY POINT A PLAYER MAY ACCUSE ANOTHER PLAYER OF BEING DISLOYAL TO SUPERCOMPUTER. 

IF A MAJORITY AGREE, THAT PLAYER IS KILLED AND IS INTEGRATED INTO SUPERCOMPUTER. 

PLAYERS INTEGRATED INTO SUPERCOMPUTER WEIGH IN ON VOTES BUT CANNOT VOTE. 

AT ANY POINT A PLAYER MAY VOTE TO REVEAL ALL CARDS. THE VOTE MUST BE UNANIMOUS.

IF YES, REVEAL ALL CARDS. 

YOU MUST REVEAL CARDS IF THERE ARE ONLY TWO PLAYERS. 

IF THERE ARE ANY DIAMONDS OR CLUBS, ALL HUMANS DIE AS HUMANS CANNOT BE TRUSTED. 

IF THERE ARE ONLY CLUBS AND DIAMONDS, SUPERCOMPUTER DIES. 

IF THERE ARE ONLY HEARTS AND SPADES, SUPERCOMPUTER WINS.
