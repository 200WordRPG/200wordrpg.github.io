Look up: the True Humans and their servants went there, uncounted ages past. They never returned.

Look around: ramshackle villages, rusting keeps, observatories, cracked walls, and rolling heaths covering an immense labyrinth.

Below is the 'neath. No levels, no depths; winding everywhere, joining everyplace. The underworld, porous, immediate.

PREPARE
Arms & Armour: fight, overcome physical challenges, Persist 6
Subtlety & Stealth: pass undetected, defeat locks and barriers, Persist 5
Study & Search: detect secrets, unlock puzzles, summon arcane powers, Persist 5

HOW HARD?
Tough: 7+
Daunting: 9+
Terrible: 11+
Roll two dice, meet or exceed the number. Roll one more die and take the best for preparation.

PERSISTENCE
You're hurt, lost, terrified, confused. Roll a die. If you roll under Persist, you stand; deduct 1. If you roll over, you falter and attempt to flee. If you cannot flee, you may die, or be permanently lost.
Rest in safe places and regain Persist. If physically wounded, deduct 1 Persist until healed.

MOST THINGS, YOU CAN ONLY DRIVE OFF
Nithers
Scallydorfs
Skulkers
Lurkers
Witchspiders
Strangleggers

FINDING
1: dust and shadows
2-3: feature, obstacle
4: hostilities
5: negotiation
6: wonder
