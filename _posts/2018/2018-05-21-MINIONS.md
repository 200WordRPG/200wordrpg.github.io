BAM! You need a bunch of dice: d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, and a black d12.

POW! You are all minions of a supervillain, cannon fodder against the Batman. Choose a villain and assign a stupid villain-themed name to your minion (like "Snowflake" or "Coldsnap" for Mr. Freeze's minions) along with 2d4, 2d6, and 2d8 to your three stats: Brains, Brawn, and Bwah-ha-ha!. 

THWACK! When attempting to do an action, choose Brains if it's a thinky/smarts thing, Brawn if it's a physical thing, or Bwah-ha-ha! for anything else. Roll your dice from those and if there's an element in the scene that helps you, roll an additional die of that size. If it's super helpful, add another. If any other minion helps you, add one die of the next bigger size. If the villain helps you, add a d4. If Batman is present, also roll that black d12. 

ZOWIE! If any dice results match, you succeed! Tell how things went okay. (Generally, the higher the number on the match, the more awesome it is.) If no dice match, tell how things went bad. HOWEVER! If the d12 matches your match, tell how Batman defeats you.
