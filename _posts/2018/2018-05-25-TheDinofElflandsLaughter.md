As elvenkind, you have lost the ever-shifting border of Elfland and are trapped in the human realm. After a fortnight, you are lost forever.

One Gamekeeper (GK) and Player(s):

a) Wise Druid. Calls upon nature with mystical staff. (d4, life[1])
     once/day: COMMUNE - Locate border. Match D20 vs. GK.*
b) Resourceful Rover. Covers ground with dagger and bow. (d8, life[2])
     once/day: CONCEAL - HIDE entire party.
c) Fervid Warrior. Exercises force with fabled sword. (d12, life[3])
     once/day: BERSERK - HARM all foes.

*If no druid, players find another way.

Players navigate the perilous world of any human culture, populated and described by the GK. Humans are:
      - WEAK (d6, life[1])
      -	AVERAGE (d10, life[2])
      -	TOUGH (d12, life[3])

Most humans are greedy, desperate, afraid. May be friend, foe, both. Most consider elves tales, and may well think you children.

Roll to interact. (Failure invites consequence):

KNOW 1 answer: 1-3
HEAL 1 life: 1-2
HIDE 1 hour: 3-8
SEEK 1 thing: 3-6
SWAY 1 opinion: 7-10
MOVE 1 thing/yourself: 9-12
HARM X life: Roll√∑4

Will you perish in the harsh human realm or regain the mirth of your twilit home?
