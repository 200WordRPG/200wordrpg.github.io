```
The world is ending. Why?

You are together. Maybe you’re the only people who knew it was happening, maybe you care about each other above anyone else, maybe you have nowhere else to go, maybe there’s another reason entirely.

Where did you live, before? What did you dream of? What do you want now? What’s your secret? How do you feel about the others? How do you feel about yourself?

Scene 1 - 7 days to go:

You’re on a beach together. What does it look like? 

You know now that there’s no hope. Are you angry? Scared? What have you lost? Will you comfort each other? Argue?

Scene 2 - 4 days to go:

You’re on a beach together. What does it look like? 

Do you give into despair? Try to give the others false hope? What do they need? What do you need?

Scene 3 - 1 day to go:

You’re on a beach together. What does it look like?  

Do you need to talk? Can you bear to be silent? This is the last chance to tell the truth.

Scene 4 - 1 minute to go:

(Set a timer)

You’re on a beach together. You say goodbye. Hold hands. Then silence.
