sonder: realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own.

game about the extras of everyday life
an exercise of empathy to strangers

get a domino set
divide the pieces equally between participants.
each piece is a character sheet with traits and connections. 

first player puts a piece of choice on the center of the table, saying: 

“I'm...__(N)__.” 

using N words to describes their character, where N = one of the numbers [0-6] on half domino piece.

then, describes an everyday life scene for their character.

next, other participantes may ask one question about that character, clockwise.

 *if (N) is the lowest choosed number, player answer the question; 
 *if (N) is the highest, other participants respond;
 *If they’re equal, alternate.

all are encouraged to build on previous answers.

when turn ends, next player connects one of their pieces to the other half, if they can [if not, skip], and starts another turn: new character, same rules applying. 

except that this new character has to had witnessed in some way the last scene, as a passerby, having made eye contact.

game ends when all pieces are rhizomatically connected on the table.

For those a little more curious about the feeling of the game, it was inspired by this video, from the Dctionary of Obscure Sorrows: https://youtu.be/AkoML0_FiV4
