This is a Pack, it is a person, it is you.
Your name is the sum of the member’s names.
Your motivation is the implication of the member’s needs.
Your fears are the member’s fears.
Your abilities are the totals of the member’s abilities.
Roll under an ability on a twenty-sided die to succeed at a task. If you fail a dangerous task roll again to avoid losing a member!    
You have Composure.
You start with 12 Composure. Gain 1 when satisfying a member’s need or adding a willing member. Lose 1 when facing a member’s fear. Spend 10 to split yourself. Roll under Composure minus the number of members to add a defeated enemy Pack member to yourself.
Scenes: survive a shipwreck, outwit the merchant pack, infiltrate the royal pack’s castle, seduce the beautiful royal heir pack. Defeat the assassin pack.
