Throwing yourselves to the ground, your spaceship explodes. What a pain! It’ll be ages before a ship comes looking for you. Oh well, there’s gotta be something to do around this “Earth” place while you wait.

--------------------

Nominate one person to be the Game Master. The rest are aliens from the planet Rymulus - a world where anything that rhymes is true. As a group, decide on a goal for the aliens - e.g. assassinating the president or creating a successful mountain bike hire company.

Aliens are pretty incompetent - they can’t do anything of any difficulty. However, they do have the power to transform things. To do this:
  - The alien announces that they want to transform something in the scene.
  - The GM writes down a short description of whatever it is the alien wants to transform - e.g. “rolled-up newspaper” or “Vince, the accountant”.
  - If the alien comes up with a rhyme for that description with the same number of syllables, the thing is transformed into the rhyming phrase - e.g. an alien might transform a “rolled-up newspaper” into a “full-size skyscraper”. 
  - The GM narrates the consequences of this. 

The game ends when the aliens achieve their goal or give up.

If players are taking too long to think of a rhyme, the GM can start limiting the time they have before the transformation fails.
