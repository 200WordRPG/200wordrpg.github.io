```
Players are superheroes defending a neighborhood/city/country/planet from evil and disaster.
They have 6 stats: Strength, Speed, Toughness, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
Stats are ranked either F, D, C, B, A, or S
The rankings correspond to the following dice:
F: d4
D: d6
C: d8
B: d10
A: d12
S: d20
Any time the player attempts to do something non-trivial they roll a die corresponding to the stat corresponding to the task. If the number is high enough (as determined by the GM) they succeed, if not, they fail.
A player can have up to 2 S rank stats, 3 A, and 1 B if they have no other powers.
During character creation players can design their own powers; the GM will determine how much they must lower their base stats to acquire the power.
Upon completing enough heroic actions, the GM may let the players level up, either by gaining more powers, higher ranks, or upgrading their current powers.
All things like player death, health, or complex combat will be up to the discretion and creativity of the GM. Creativity > Giant Rules Section
