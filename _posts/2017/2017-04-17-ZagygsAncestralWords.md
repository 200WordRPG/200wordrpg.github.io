These are ZAGYGâ€™S ANCESTRAL WORDS! They are spread across lands in three little brown books for the enjoyment of all!

Alchemist, Apes, Archer, Assassin, Berserker, Bomb, Brigand, Cleric, Dungeon, Dragon, Dwarf, Elemental, Elf, Fearsome, Fighting Man, Fungus,Ghoul, Giant, Goblin, Golem, Halfling, Horror, Horseman, Hydra, Infravision, Lycanthrope, Magic, Manticore, Medusa, Minotaur, Myrmidon, Necromancer, Pirate, Pixie, Poison, Rat, Robot, Scorpion, Shadow, Skeleton, Slime, Snake, Sorcerer, Spectre, Spider, Swordsman, Teleportation, Thief, Troll, Undead, Unicorn, Vampire, Viking, Wand, Warrior, Wizard, Wolf, Worm, Wraith, Wyvern, Yeti, Zombie

Take part in the ancient ritual, name someone to be the Master of Games. 

They pick 4 words to frame the tale and then banish 2 who shall not be. 

Others, Players of Characters, then pick 2 words and become Heroes.  

Master of games, tell the tale of those Fabled Heroes! Weave fiction, ask questions! 

Heroes, put yourself at risk and roll them bones (2d6, one white, one red). 

WHITE IS GOOD, RED IS BAD! 

The highest die determines your fate. 

If WHITE shows a 6, pick a new word. If it shows a 1, remove one. 

When one of your words apply to a situation, roll 2 white and 1 red. The Gygaxian Gods favors you!

I decided to go back to the roots of the words we are using in our games. I took the OD&D little brown books and processed them through a wordlist website to see which words resonated closely to me. Then the game kinda wrote itself.
