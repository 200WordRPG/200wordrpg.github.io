You are Powerful and Dedicated Martial Artists competing to determine who is the Pasta Master by eating Pasta, the Ultimate Energy Source.

Each Competitor has a Name, Costume and Ingredient (Anything all players can eat). Put each Name on a Tournament Bracket.

Wander to a Market and get any Ingredients you need: Pasta, the chosen Ingredients, salt, pepper, garlic, olive oil, and other staples.

Boil salted water in a big pot, and prepare many saucepans. When it boils, add the pasta, removing only when ready. Ensure Pasta flows constantly, like a river.

Another Competitor makes the sauce for their battle. It must contain both player's chosen Ingredients, and should be as tasty as possible. Olive oil, spices and garlic make a fine base. Deliberately making gross food is highly dishonorable.

The Pasta is then served, stopping when 1 competitor says to stop. Starting after the cry "Allez Cuisine!", The players then race to finish their Pasta first. The fastest Competitor moves ahead, and the cycle repeats with the next Competitors.

If there's an odd number of Competitors, the remainder eats a bowl of Pasta, on their own.

The final victor is the Pasta Master, and doesn't have to clean up.
