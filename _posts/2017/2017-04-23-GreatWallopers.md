The prairie dogs are attacking in force, how many points can you rack up before getting overrun! This game has two win conditions; Be the last one standing, or first to 10 points. Every round the prairie dogs attack in a force the size of the round, 1 at round one and 20 on round 20. Every round the players roll 1d20, as long as the players roll is greater than or equal to the prairie dogs they gain a point, otherwise they lose half of their points rounded up, hit 0 points and you lose. Players can exchange points to gain a permanent additional die of that size, 4 points for 1d4, you can reduce to 0 points this way without losing. If you roll a 20 on the d20 you gain an additional point.

This game has an extremely low barrier to entry and while it is very light on narrative, it still evokes interesting imagery of a group of friends being overrun by  little furry critters.
