Magic is sad and beautiful. A chance to express yourself fully and make a difference, at the cost of your mind. Will you journey to make the world a better place? Or will you lord your powers over others? And more importantly, will you even still be "You" in the end?

Before your journey as a Wizard begins, commit to paper (Bond Paper recommended) your most treasured memories, enough to fill it with only a half-inch above, the sides, and bottom blank. Your SpellMaster (GM) then prepares a candle in front of you. As your journey starts he invokes the Spirit of Magic by bringing the candle alight. Your SpellMaster guides you on your odyssey and advises you in the manner in which your memories must be kindled in the Spirit of Magic to bring your spells to life. The more complex the spell you've described, the longer your memories stay wreathed in the Spirit of Magic and burned away. 

At the end of your adventure, when your SpellMaster extinguishes the Spirit of Magic, check how much you still remember of your old life. Are you still you? Are you better? Are you worse? And was it worth it?
