Needed: polyhedral dice, pencils, paper

One player is GameMaster who NARRATES WORLD.

Others make Characters and interact with narration:
 * Divide 5 points between attributes (0-3 each): Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Charm
 * Write down three skills. Assign vales: 1, 2, 3. (e.g.: pickpocket, laser, fireball)
 * Life Points = 3 + (strength * 2)
 * List possessions


When character’s actions might fail:
 * GameMaster rates task’s difficulty.
 * Player rolls die from table.
 * RR = Roll results
 * Bonuses = values of all relevant attributes and skills
 * Outcome = RR - Bonuses

Contests:
 * Difficulty decides die. 
 * All parties roll. 
 * Outcome = RR - Bonuses
 * Low Result wins.

Attacks:
 * Armor/Defense = Difficulty Die
 * Attack Value (AV) = Strength (melee), or Dexterity (ranged), or Intelligence (occult)
 * Outcome = RR - Bonuses - AV
 * Subtract damage from life.
 * Life = zero: unconscious or dead
 * Rest to heal.
