```
Character creation:

Spend 12 points among: Might, Agility, Wits, Willpower and Charisma. 4 points maximum per trait.
Take the 13 cards of one color from a deck, sorted from 1 to King.
Write a short backstory.

Overcoming challenges:

When trying something hazardous, roll a D8, and add the corresponding trait. You can invoke some part of your backstory and add 2 more to your roll, but only once per part.
After rolling you can choose to go beyond your limits: discard the first card of your deck and add its value to your roll (+15 for figures). 
If you score high enough it's a success, if not you suffer an injury.
A difficulty of 5 is very easy (riding a saddled horse), 10 is very difficult (riding a horse when tied up). Go beyond for near-to-impossible tasks.

Taking injuries:

Failure and being hit both hurt the same way: you suffer injuries every time you fail a roll. When injured, a character discard the first card of his deck.

When the last card of a deck is discarded, the character leave the game. She can be too much hurt, dead, despaired, angry toward their friends... Her adventure stops here.

More complete rules exist to play a campaign, with character progression and special abilities. As written here it is supposed to be played as a stand-alone short session (like at a convention) of 4 players (so you need only one deck of cards).
