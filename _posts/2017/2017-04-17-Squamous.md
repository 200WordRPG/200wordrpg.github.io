```
You are each eldritch abominations, taking human form for nefarious purposes.  Your human vessels areâ€¦ weak.  Disgusting. Meat. Always sweating, defecating, desiring. How do humans tolerate this?


Each abomination has a secret eldritch Goal.  Write down a noun and a verb.  Give the noun to your left-hand player and the verb to your right-hand player.  Combine the noun and verb you receive for your Goal. Take 15 d6s. You succeed at your Goal when you have no dice.

Describe your human appearance and identity.


Each player has authority over a human Need. Things like hunger, hygiene, sexual desire, romance, social acceptance. Name yours.


Take turns framing scenes where you perform tasks to achieve your Goal. Other players roleplay NPCs, describe scenery, etc.  

When they describe how their Need complicates your task, they offer 2-5 dice.  Roll one die. 

If you roll higher than the number of offered dice, the Need causes problems. Take the offered dice.  

If you roll lower, you resist the urge. That player takes back their dice and the die you rolled.  

If you roll equal, then you succeed at your task even while still succumbing to the Need. Discard all rolled and offered dice.
