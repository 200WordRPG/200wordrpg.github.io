```
WD
- Immortal being.
- Can influence R’s mind.
- Can’t talk.
- Must be kept sad, but not too much.
- Gains power depending on her emotional state. 
- Doesn’t necessarily know about or want to destroy Earth. 
- Insensitive to anything physical.

LOOK: 
- Innocent
- unspeakable
- human
- animal
- weird

WANTS
- freedom
- world destruction
- seclusion

R
- WD’s guardian.
- must keep her mood balanced.

ORIGIN: 
- Army
- Government
- Mystical
- Heir
- other...

Start by choosing a role and presenting to each other.
Answer each other’s questions.
Each scene R does something to WD.

R pick one and narrates what you do/say:
- HATE
- TEASE
- NOSTALGIA
- LOVE
- CARNAGE
- FAMILY
- GUILT
- TRUTH
 - HUMILIATION
- GOD

WD: decide how much it delights/saddens you. Add/subtract up to 10 from the mood. Use each value just once.
Then telepathically show something back to R, depending on your mood. (use the same word). You have full access to R’s memories and personal triggers (just ask to R’s player).

STARTING MOOD: 20 
- R can’t know the MOOD value until the end
- +50= WD gets too happy. The End.
-10= R can’t take it anymore. The End. 
- R uses all the elements of the list. WD reveals her mood score. R decides if they want to retire.

When people say that a game should be fun, my good friend Rugerfred freaks out. Foam from the mouth and everything. So this game is for him. Even the R character is named after him.
