The first book was a roaring success. You have the adulation of millions of fans. Can you strike gold a second time? Or are you a one-hit wonder?

You’re parts of the author’s psyche: roll individually to see which STORY ARC you’re after.

Take turns producing a paragraph of story, rolling to incorporate a PLOT ELEMENT.

The publisher wants changes! Once everyone’s had a turn pick another section then change it, according to an EDIT roll. Continue until a result comes up a fourth time.

ROLL  STORY ARC                       PLOT ELEMENT               EDIT
1     Rags to Riches (rise)           Narrow Miss                Make it more like the first book
2     Riches to Rags (fall)           Moment of Levity           Punch it up a bit!
3     Man in a Hole (fall then rise)  Exposition                 Change up the character roles
4     Icarus (rise then fall)         Tempting Offer             Add another PLOT ELEMENT (roll)
5     Cinderella (rise-fall-rise)     Conflict                   Move a section. Edit for continuity
6     Oedipus (fall-rise-fall)        Character Defining Moment  Make it less like the first book

-SCORING-

6pts divided among those with the final STORY ARC.
2pts for going first.
1pt per first book reference.
-1pt per inconsistency added.
1pt if an EDIT got laughs.

Argue over what counts.

## Author Comments 

Story Arcs are from here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07772 Plot Elements I pulled out of my ass.

I also wanted to incorporate parts of this list, but could not due to space constraints: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_narrative_techniques It may be fun to consider adding them into the mix.
