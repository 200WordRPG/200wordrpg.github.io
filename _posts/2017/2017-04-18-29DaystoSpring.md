An attempt to understand the perspective of the men in the battle for Iwo Jima

Western Child (CW): describe maturing in 1920’s America. Your old man talks about the Great War, what does it mean to you?

Eastern Child (CE): describe maturing in 1920’s in Japan. Your father tells you to honor your family, what does this mean to you?

CW: You hear of the attack on Pearl Harbor. America’s hackles raise. How do you feel?

CE: You speak with your brother, a proud member of the Imperial Japanese Army. He refuses to ever be taken alive. What do you say?

CW: Your brothers are ready to take the beach. Your brothers are real, those animals are not. Nevertheless, how do you survive as they kill your brothers?

CE: The enemy approaches, promising destruction. They do not see your imminent ambush. How does this make you feel?

CW: Brothers fallen. Alone. Hated enemy in hiding. One attacks! A stab in the side. What rushes through your mind?

CE: You rush the enemy as commanded. Home. Family. Honor.  He shoots back into you as you rush, impaling him. Knowing it is the end, what are your thoughts?
