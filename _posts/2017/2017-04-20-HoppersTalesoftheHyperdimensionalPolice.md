You are undercover Spacetime Agents with a device that lets
you jump between worlds, tracking an interdimensional criminal.

Choose a number of worlds and time limit per world.
(suggested: four; fifteen minutes)

Enter a world by activating the device (draw a card), then start
the chosen timer.  Attempt to locate and apprehend the criminal
(GM determines action outcomes).  When the timer ends, all agents
must be able to reactivate the device together.

When activated, you jump to a world whose inhabitants:

-------| are ruled by ____          HEARTS   | a dire wound
KING   |

If the criminal is in your custody during activation, you jump home.  
The criminal stands trial.

If you cannot catch the criminal within the chosen worlds or miss a
device activation window, the multiverse collapses.

## Author Comments 

As envisioned, the GM simply determines action outcomes based on what works best dramatically for the story, but you can tack on whatever determining system strikes your fancy. Additional quirk ideas as well as suggestions for suit encounters forthcoming. Special thanks to Michael Blatherwick for invaluable feedback.
