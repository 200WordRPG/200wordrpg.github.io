For any number of players, each of whom wants to walk away with the full contents of the Vault. Think to yourself what you'd do with all that money -- debts paid, loved ones saved, mistakes undone.

This game jumps back and forth between two scenes: the planning stage of a heist, and the heist itself.

Planning stage: Players discuss their plan for breaking into the Vault. How to distract guards, steal keys, deactivate cameras. You work together to get in, but remember that only one person can leave with the money. When you feel confident, move to the heist stage.

Heist stage: Players take turns executing the plan, rolling dice to perform anything difficult. Roll 2d6 and sum them -- anything above a 10 grants players a bonus, but anything under a 7 is a failed action. Once an action is failed, jump back to the planning phase -- failing here was all part of the plan. Explain how your failure was all part of the plan, and how you move forward now.

Once a player is in the vault, all bets are off. No more planning stage, just action in the moment. The person who walks out with the money wins.
