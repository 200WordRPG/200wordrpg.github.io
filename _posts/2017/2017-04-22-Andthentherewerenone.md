A short mystery/slasher game for up to ten players

We are trapped in an enclosed space. One of us wants to kill us.

All together, we first…
Discuss the era: medieval, Victorian, modern, sci-fi,…
Discuss the setting: isolated island, castle under siege, traveling boat or spaceship,…
Discuss the killer’s motive: revenge, justice, madness, hunger, intrigue,…

Each turn, each character still alive rolls a white d10.
Who gets the lowest result gets killed.

Each turn, each character murdered rolls a red d10.
Who gets the highest result narrates how the victim is killed and gain one point.
During the first round, the victim narrates.
Describe when, where and how. Establish the scene, add good details, and give some clues about the killer’s identity. Narrate the death: be gory, be horrific, be subtle.

If you want to influence who the killer is, you can give their player your red die to roll. You can change your mind at any moment.

When the last character is killed, who has the most points reveals themselves as the true killer. Obviously, they weren’t really dead. They narrate the epilogue, explain how they faked their death, and reveal their motive in details.

Obvious inspirations:
And then there were none
Alien
Fiasco
Any slasher movie, actually...

And finally, if you need a little inspiration for the murders:
Ten little Indian boys went out to dine;
One choked his little self and then there were nine.
Nine little Indian boys sat up very late;
One overslept himself and then there were eight.
Eight little Indian boys travelling in Devon;
One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.
Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks;
One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.
Six little Indian boys playing with a hive;
A bumblebee stung one of them and then there were five.
Five little Indian boys going in for law;
One got in Chancery and then there were four.
Four little Indian boys going out to sea;
A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.
Three little Indian boys walking in the zoo;
A big bear hugged one and then there were two.
Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun;
One got all frizzled up and then there was one.
One little Indian boy left all alone;
He went and hanged himself and then there were none.
