## Author Comments 

I wanted to make a fun easy system to simulate the tension of TV Dramas. It can be any kind of tension, be it comic, horror, suspense, romantic, social, anything.

This can be used for games inspired be monster of the week shows, telenovelas, slapstick comedies, espionage or criminal capers, anime romance, cartoon sleuthing mysteries, or any story where tension is important.

Some classics Roleplaying Games such as Ghost Busters, Paranoia, or Call of Cthulhu may, with some fun modifications, benefit from using this simple system. 

Thanks to the folks at Impossible Dream, makers of Dread. I tweaked their tower crashing mechanic to do what I needed it to do for this game.

Thank you Hasbro Gaming for making Jenna and popularizing the jumbling tower game.
