```
You are a person. You have wants that you must pursue, fears you try to avoid, needs you must have meet, traumas that follow you, language you use to show love with, and a goal you need others to help you achieve.
Love Language requires 3 to 5 players, notecards, and a pencil.
The table chooses a Challenge. Then each player writes their characterâ€™s name, traits, and relationship to the other characters on a notecard.
Traits are:
Wants (if you achieve it 1 Check)
Needs (if you fill it 1 Check)
Fears (if you face it 1 Check)
Traumas (if you overcome it 1 Check)
Love language (how you show and receive love, if you speak or experience it 1 Check)
To complete a Challenge everyone needs to have at least 3 Checks.
After Character creation, go around the table framing scenes. You get Checks when someone frames a scene that deals with one of your traits. Continue framing scenes until everyone has 3 Checks or the table chooses to stop.
When you are ready to complete a Challenge frame a scene of all the characters completing it. When you are done epilogue your characters and their relationships.
