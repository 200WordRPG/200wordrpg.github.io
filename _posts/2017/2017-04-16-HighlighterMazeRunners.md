One player is the maze master and draws a dungeon on a sheet of paper.  Hex or grid paper is excellent for this.

Indicate start and finish.

Players take turns moving.

Moving requires a player to balance their highlighter tip down then while pushing down flick it forward.  If the pen mark hits a wall an encounter occurs.  All players whose last pen mark can draw a direct line to the interception can fight in this encounter.

Roll a D6.  This many opponents are encountered.

All players roll as many dice as they have to attack and are successful if they roll over the target.  Each success defeats an opponent.  1 die is removed from each player for surviving opponents.

Abilities cost 1 dice to use

Play proceeds until the players lose all their dice or their pen mark reaches the finish.

Used to play this game with classmates back in the 70's.  It would look great with a couple of diagrams.
