Find 2 friends to play with. 
Pick a role each. 
The PROTAGONIST says who they are and what their goal is. 
Play to find out what happens. 

The game is narrated out of the perspective of the PROTAGONIST. They describe themselves, the scene and what is in it, but each description must be followed by a question, answered by the BEAST or GUARDIAN. 
    If both have an answer - failure fulfills the BEAST’s answer and success fulfills the GUARDIAN’s. 

When the PROTAGONIST has 0 remaining dice, switch roles to one you’ve not yet played this session. The game ends when the last PROTAGONIST has 0 dice or reached The GOAL.

GUARDIAN or BEAST cannot both use their powers on the same roll.

The PROTAGONIST
Pick up 3d6, each representing traits or items.
Name/Describe these.
Discard after using. 
Roll to overcome adversity. 1-3 = failure. 4-6 = success!
Each new player does this, establishing new facts about the same PROTAGONIST.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GUARDIAN - a force for good
Add 1d4 to the PROTAGONIST’s roll (Once / Scene)
Introduce advantage (add 1d6 to PROTAGONIST’s pool) (Once / Scene)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The BEAST - a force for evil
Deduct 1d4 from PROTAGONIST’s roll (Once / Scene)
Force PROTAGONIST to roll against adversity
