You are a SKELETON, and you have been animated by your GAME MASTER to complete a mission.

You only have one SKILL, and one ITEM.

Whenever the GM deems your TASK hard enough, you must roll a D6.

In order to succeed, you need to roll a 5 or more.
When using your SKILL or ITEM, you need to a roll a 3 or more.

SKELETONS canâ€™t die, but they can lose LIMBS. When you fail a TASK, lose a LIMB.
You can also sacrifice a LIMB before rolling to automatically succeed a TASK.

Draw your SKELETON on a piece of paper, and tear off a LIMB when you lose it in game.
1-SKULL
1-SPINE
1-LEFT ARM
1-RIGHT ARM
1-LEFT LEG
1-RIGHT LEG
Example
A SKELETON with no RIGHT LEG or LEFT LEG attempts to steal a car.

(They roll a 5, succeeding.)

They successfully break the window, and unlock the door, then get in the driver seat.

However, with no legs, they cannot reach the accelerator or brake pedals!

As you lose LIMBS you will need to become more creative in your solutions to the TASKS that you face.

Turn order is determined however you like, we just go clockwise.
Missions can range from stealing a delivery truck full of milk, to assassinating the president for anti-skeleton propaganda.
