You are ancient Greek poet-playwrights competing for the Ivy Wreath at the Great Dionysia festival.

Allocate 3, 2, and 1 to the following:

Melete (Practice)
Mneme (Memory)
Aoide (Song)

Choose two Muses you have the favor of:

Calliope (epic poetry)
Clio (history)
Euterpe (lyric poetry)
Thalia (comedy)
Melpomene (tragedy)
Terpsichore (dance)
Erato (love poetry)
Polyhymnia (sacred poetry)
Urania (astronomy)

Play goes in rounds. Each turn, decide on an action:


=Seek Inspiration=

Choose another poet and agree on a Muse to seek. Describe how. Each gain an Inspiration for that Muse with Quality = 1d6 - 4 + Mneme. Write down the Quality, Muse, and idea.


=Write=

Choose an Inspiration, describe the resulting scene, and write a representative line on a piece of paper. Destroy the Inspiration.

It has Quality = 1d6 - 4 + Aoide + Inspiration Quality, + 1 if your favored Muse.

If > 3, you may write two scenes, splitting Quality.


=Revise=

Choose a scene, crumple, and discard it. Describe your new idea.

Gain an Inspiration for the ideaâ€™s Muse with Quality = 1d6 + Melete + 4 - Scene Quality.


After 7 rounds, take turns performing your plays. Secretly vote for one other play you liked.

The play with the highest total Quality + 3x votes wins the Ivy Wreath.
