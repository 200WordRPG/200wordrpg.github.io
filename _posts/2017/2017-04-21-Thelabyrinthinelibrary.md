Need 
Scrabble tiles,  DM & 3-4 players

Players are the Arcanistâ€™s assistants. Sent into the labyrinthine library to find a lost spell scroll. The DM makes up a series of challenges. 

Character creation
Characters have 2 HP. Take 2 scrabble tiles. The Letters are your Initials. Make up your names.  The numbers give you 2 abilities from list below.  
1 = +1HP
2 = nimble
3 = goodshot 
4 = brawler 
5 = small animal companion (cat/owl/ferret etc)
8 = academic
10 = 1 (DM approved) spell
0 your choice

Challenges are resolved by players pulling scrabble tiles. If player justifies using ability, pick 2 & return 1. Players keep used tiles.

Vowels = success
Consonant = failure 
& If 
B bookshelves change their layout 
C cursed tome opens
D find drinks trolley 
F fairytale comes to life
G goblin book thief attacks
M meet forgotten previous apprentice
P poisonous bookmold
T trap!
Y learn something helpful

DM decides if a failure means characters lose 1HP, face additional challenges or simply fail to progress. 

DM draws a tile to represent NPC attacks. All NPC have 1HP. Successful attacks by players & NPCs remove 1HP. 

DM wraps up when all tiles used. Surviving characters use collected tiles to create the spell words.
