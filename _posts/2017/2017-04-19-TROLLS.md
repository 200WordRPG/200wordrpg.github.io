```
You are a troll: an under-the-bridge, ugly-as-sin, billy-goats-gruff troll.
 
Fortunately, you chose a bridge with a good wifi connection.
 
Make up an internet handle and write it down for everyone to see.
 
In secret, write down three physical aspects about which you, the troll, are extremely insecure. DO NOT draw on you, the player’s, insecurities.
 
The last troll to finish their list starts by stating their opinion on a topic, real or imaginary.
 
SPEAK ONLY IN TROLLSPEAK.
 
CALL CHARACTERS ONLY BY THEIR HANDLE.
 
IT IS YOUR JOB TO PURIFY THE INTERNET OF WRONGNESS.
 
DO THIS BY INSULTING OTHERS' LOOKS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE.
 
WHENEVER SOMEONE MENTIONS ONE OF YOUR ASPECTS, EVEN IF NOT AT YOU, YOU MUST RESPOND IMMEDIATELY.
 
NO PHYSICAL CONTACT WHATSOEVER.
 
If any troll thinks they have figured out someone else’s aspects, they can yell "BLOG POST", at which all other trolls must fall silent while the first enumerates those aspects.
 
If right, the attacked troll cannot blog post anymore. If wrong, the same happens to the attacker.
 
Play continues until only one troll can still blog.
 
End with a group pact "by the name of [winner's handle]" never to speak or write as you have just done.
