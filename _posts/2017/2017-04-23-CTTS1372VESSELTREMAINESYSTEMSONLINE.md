You need at least 4 people. Everyone plays a new employee of a galactic shipping company. You just woke from cryogenic stasis and your job is to make sure that your cargo reaches the station.

If you lost the last game you played, you instead play a parasitic worm, controlling a host body. Don’t reveal this.



When you check the computer, roll 2d20. Pick a result. If you are a worm, you must choose the lowest value.

0 DOCK COMPLETE. Go home.
1 SYSTEMS OK. -1 to next result.
2 Someone roleplays a video message from your family.
3 Tell everyone news from home.
4 BIO-CHECKUP. Lead the group in an activity.
5 Play music on someone’s phone.
6 AUTOPILOT. Roll 1 die next time. 
7 LOADING. Reroll.
8 Say what the revised mission is.
9-10 Say the ETA.
11 DATA CORRUPT. Guess the cargo.
12 OFFLINE. Roll 3 dice next time.
13-14 METEORITES DETECTED. +1 to next result.
15 GENERATORS ENGAGED. Turn off/on the room lights.
16 CONTAMINANT DETECTED.
17 HULL BREACH. Close/open all doors in the room.
18 OXYGEN LOW. Everyone must speak softer.
19 Describe a new lifeform.
20-21 A meteorite destroys the ship.
