```
A scene begins. An accusatory statement about one of the players is made. The accused player rolls a die. A higher number means the accusation is more truthful, lower meaning it is more false. Only the accused player may now the result, and can interpret the roll freely if enough ambiguity exists. Any player who wishes to participate in the scene may do so freely. The players must decide if the accusation is true and deal out punishment if it is. The accused must avoid punishment without revealing the roll. The scene proceeds with as many players as desired, for as long as the players desire. At the end of the scene it is revealed how truthful the accusation was. If the players make the wrong choice, they lose. If the accused is punished, he/she loses.
