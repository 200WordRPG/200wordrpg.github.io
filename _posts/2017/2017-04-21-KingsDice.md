King’s Dice is a simulated gambling game.

Set-up:
Each Player needs twenty six-sided (d6) dice.
There is one communal twenty-sided (d20) King’s die.

Game-play:
Players roll the d20. Highest roller starts with the d20. The d20 is rolled. All players starting with the d20 roller say how many d6 they will roll. Each player rolls the dice specified. Sum each player’s dice. Player closest to the d20 result wins all the d6 rolled. Winner then rolls the d20 for the next round.

In the event of a tie, tied players take one additional d6 and decide whether the die will add or subtract from their total. Players roll the dice and adjust their totals. Continue until there is no tie or someone is out of dice. If a player runs out of dice during a tie-breaker, they roll no more dice that turn. Should a player’s sum equal the d20 result, before ties, and is the only player to do so, that player wins the round plus one additional die from each player. The game ends a player has no dice at the end of a round. The player with the most d6s at the end of the game wins.

This is a shortened, revised edition of a dice gambling game I made for my D&D and Pathfinder RPG games. The game can be played in-character, or outside of the game. If used in game, players can assign the value of each d6 to determine how much money to contribute to the pot. Characters will cash in their dice at the end of the game. You can find the original version of the game here: https://thedmdr.blogspot.com/2015/07/kings-dice-gambling-game-for-rpgs.html
