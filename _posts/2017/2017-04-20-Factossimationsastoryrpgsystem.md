SYNOPSIS~

Players operate FACTS, POSSIBILITIES, and TRANSFORMATIONS.

These create or change aspects about: CHARACTER (characters or groups); STORY (plot-lines, dialogue-cues, events...); and SETTING (place, conditions...); referring to past, present, or future.

PREPARATION~  
    
Breathe.   
    
Each player establishes:
    
1 fact about each: setting; setting history; and own character history;

3 facts about own character;
   
1 possibility about each: setting; setting history; story; story history; and another player's character.
  
GAME~

Each player receives 1 Transformation, 1 Possibility, and 3 Facts to use Per Scene. Establish these in-scene or as logical, changing existing or creating new  elements.
 
[Play character-affecting facts only on own character, unless whole group agrees otherwise.]

FACTS are true at creation.
    
Facts change possibilities into Facts, and Facts into Hard Facts.
    
HARD FACTS are difficult to change.
  
POSSIBILITIES remain uncertain until changed into Facts.
Possibilities change Facts into Transformations.
  
TRANSFORMATIONS remain active until changed into Facts.
    
Transformations change Facts into (new) Facts.
    
2 Transformations + 1 Possibility can amalgamate 2 Hard Facts into 1 (new) Hard Fact.
    
[Players organise sharing non-player-characters, or one takes host role by rotation or solely. Each npc has 4 own character Facts available when created or as necessary.]
