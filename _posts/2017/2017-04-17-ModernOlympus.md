A Two-Player Game

Premise:
          The ancient Olympians have survived to this day, but time has mangled their portfolios.  They remember what they were; most hate what they are.  With enough divine energy, they can reclaim their original godhead.

Characters:
                                    Ancient                       Modern

Hermes                       Trickery                        Internet
Dionysus                     Drunkenness               Politics
 
Goal: 
          Find other Olympians. Absorb their divinity through pleading, coercion, deception, or violence.

Rules:
- Player can always sense the direction (but not identity) of the nearest Olympian.
- Olympians cannot die or fade away before losing their divinity. “Killed” Olympians revive unscathed within one hour.
- Divinity cannot be absorbed from unwilling Olympians unless they’re unconscious. 
- Absorbing an Olympian’s divinity adds its portfolios to player’s own. 
- Resolve magical challenges by rolling 1d6 for ancient portfolios or 2d6 for modern portfolios.
- Resolve mundane physical, mental and social challenges by rolling 1d6.  Add +1 per applicable - ancient portfolio; add +2 per applicable modern portfolio.
- Rolls succeed on results ≥ 5.
- If portfolio(s) were applied to mundane rolls, player narrates success / failure. Otherwise, GM narrates success / failure.

## Author Comments 

This game was inspired by my students' frequent (and often comical) misinterpretations of Greek mythology.
