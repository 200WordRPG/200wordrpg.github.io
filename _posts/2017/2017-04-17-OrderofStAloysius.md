In "The Order of St. Aloysius," each player controls a monk who attempts to live through a year while staying holy.  Each monk has four virtues (Humility, Kindness, Diligence, and Temperance) and a name.  Each player assigns the numbers 1, 2, 2, and 3 to their virtues.  All virtues are public information.

Every season, players go around the table five times, posing a single Problem to the player to their left each time.  Problems can either be External or Internal.  Every SEASON, players can only respond to as many External Problems as their Kindness, so they may choose to skip Problems.  Similarly, players can only respond to as many Internal Problems as their Temperance.  Players describe how they solve a problem, then gain victory points equal to their Humility.

Players can choose to Pray instead of responding to Problems; they can do this as many times per YEAR as their Diligence.  Players who Pray skip their turn but shift the Problem to the next player. 

During the second and forth season, the order of play reverses and players pose problems to the player on their right.

At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points wins.
