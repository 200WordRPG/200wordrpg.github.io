​Everyone needs a long sheet of paper and a pen. 

Understanding the past is tricky. ​Somewhere amid the myriad accounts, legends, songs, and artworks might hide a truth. This is a world building game. We're not looking for the truth; we're creating fragments.

In the top fifth or so of your paper write the name of a long-lost people and describe where and when they lived.

Pass your paper to the right.

On your new paper, create some art (e.g., drawing, lines of a song) from that people. Copy their name on your panel and fold the paper so only your art is visible.

Pass right.

On your new paper, describe some lore (e.g., myth, folk cure, urban legend) from that people. Copy their name on your panel and fold so only your lore is visible.

Pass right.

On your new paper, write a first person account of some major upheaval or cultural event the people experienced or celebrated. Copy their name on your panel and fold so only your account is visible.

Pass right.

Repeat: Art, Lore, Account

When you’ve no more room, reclaim your paper. Try writing a short textbook entry about the people you named.

This is a world-building play on the exquisite corpse genre of games, including Eat Poop You Cat--which is the origin for this game's name. I also wanted to create a game that at least touched on the difficulty and danger of creating narratives in history.
