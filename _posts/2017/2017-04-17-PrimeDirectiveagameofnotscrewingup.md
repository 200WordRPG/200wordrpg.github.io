Captain: Well done people. 

Players discuss proposals for first contact and trade. Eventually the Captain choses one proposal and each crewperson rolls a die; secretly adding or subtracting one. If the total is less than four times the number of players the mission is a failure. The player with the best explanation for the failure is the next Captain.   
* roll twice on subsequent lists
