In a world where everyone has a price, and technology’s true cost is intangible: One player is a Corporation. The rest are Outlaws scrabbling to survive.

Get in. Get the target. Get out. Get paid.

Allocate +3, +2, +1, +1, +0 to Styles:

Precise
Ruthless
Indirect
Cocky
Elegant

Choose a primary and secondary Role:

Role   | Special
Brains | Start a side mission to increase success or reward of your main
Muscle | Intimidate anyone who sees you in action
Face   | Learn anyone’s price
Tinker | Prepared tech: 3x per mission, neutralize a complication
Sneak  | Get into anything

When you try something risky, describe how, sum 2d6, and add the appropriate Style. Add +1 if one of your Roles applies, or +3 when using your primary's Special.

<= 6: failure. Situation worsens. If your primary Role applies, instead get a complicated and partial success.
7-9: partial or complicated success. The Corporation presents two choices.
10-11: success.
12+: success with bonus.

Successful missions:
2: +1 Style
4: Tertiary Role

Conditions:
Alone
Exposed
Trapped
Wounded
Dead

Missions:
Acquire       |   Blackmail Material
Deliver       |   Building
Destroy       |   Celebrity
Investigate   |   Corporation
Protect       |   Experiment
Sabotage      |   Politician

Complications:
Rival
Bad Information
Alarms Tripped (Green -> Yellow -> Orange -> Red)
Extra Security
Past Entanglement
Dangerous Target
Other
