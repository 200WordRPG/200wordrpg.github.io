Preparation
Both players write down a name and distribute 7 points between Rebelliousness and Determination. Players are secretly in love together, but have an oppressive force. Name the Oppressor and assign it 2 points.
 
Conflict rolls outcome
If each die rolls under target stat, the PC has Full success. If at least one die does, the PC has a partial success.
If a Player invokes a characteristic in the scene, -1 to one die per characteristic involved. Use Determination for Reroll (refresh per scene, but describe action).
 
Taking turns, each person plays one of these scenes.
