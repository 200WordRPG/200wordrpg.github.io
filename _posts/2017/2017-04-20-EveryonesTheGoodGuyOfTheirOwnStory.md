Storytelling RPG for 2 Players

Two players each take turns narrating a scene or event across five time periods, one forward through time, the other backwards. During each narration, the other player can interject one fact which must be incorporated into the narration. Along with that fact, all other statements should be assumed a true if not unbiased view of events.
At the beginning of the game, write down one in-narrative concession you would like the other character to make. If they do so, you win. This means that one, the other, both, or neither players could “win”.

Scenario 1: The Relationship

This scenario plays out over a five year relationship, each being one member of the relationship, from its beginning to its end. The five scenes occur at the meeting phase, the early relationship, the height of the relationship, its downward spiral, and its dissolution, each roughly one year apart.

Scenario 2: The Mission

This scenario plays out over five hours of a failed military mission, both characters being officers in charge of the mission. The scenes are the planning phase, the initial engagement, an ongoing stalemate, starting to lose, and the tragic withdrawal.

## Author Comments 

This game was inspired by a mix of Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon" and Jason Robert Brown's "The Last 5 Years" - both exploring how perspective often changes the nature of the story.
