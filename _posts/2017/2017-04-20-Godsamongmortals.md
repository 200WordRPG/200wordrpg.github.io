FROM THE RULER OF GODS TO THE GODS
“I sentence all of you to walk the earth. Far too long have you ignored the mortal realm. You will find your temples, avatars and worshipers all are forgotten or gone. 
You may try to escape your fate, alone you will not succeed. ”

TO THE GODS
Name? 
What are you god of? You may perform related actions without rolling. 
Anti-realm? You can’t perform related actions. 
Your avatar on earth? Last sighted?
Who worshiped you?
What do you look like? Then? Now?
Start: Mundane = 9, Godly = 50. 

When rolling: use a D100. 
If result under stat: Success. 
0-9: Triumph. 
90-99: Despair.

When performing non-trivial tasks fit for a mortal: roll Mundane. 
If fail: gain 1 Mundane.

When using your powers discreetly, indistinguishable from luck or tricks: roll Godly.

When performing a miracle: burn 10 Godly.

When Godly = 0: lose immortality.

When among worshipers: choose if rolls are against Mundane or Godly.

When a worshiper makes a major sacrifice in your name: gain 1D10 Godly.

When finding your avatar: Ascend.

TO THE RULER OF GODS
Challenge them, hide their avatars. 
Give them worshipers, take them away.
Give them hope, let the world be shaped. 
```
