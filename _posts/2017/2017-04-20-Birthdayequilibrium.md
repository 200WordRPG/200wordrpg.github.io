You all work in the same office. Go in order and introduce yourself. What kind of employee are you? Hardworking? Awkward? Unreliable?

The next person decides your position in the company - CEO, janitor or anything in between.

Oddly enough, you all have birthdays in the next few weeks. You can ask for one of the following:

1. Chocolate ($10)
2. Book ($30)
3. Whiskey ($60)
4. Game ($100)

Whichever you choose, you get $5 less (spent on wrapping paper) to invest on gifts for others.

Discuss gift ideas among yourselves. Plan carefully as there won’t be enough money for everyone. Luckily, you can take a vacation and skip one party.

Secretly write down your desired gift, whose party you’ll skip, and how will you divide your budget on others.

Celebrate birthdays in order. If you got the present you wanted - you get victory points (1 for a chocolate and up to 4 for a game). If attendants failed to raise enough money - each attendant loses 1 victory point. The winner is the person with the most points.

But.

If nobody comes to your birthday party - they’re all horrible people and they lose. You win but it’s a bitter victory.
