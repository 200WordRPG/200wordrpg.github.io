Enlist your 4 items: 3 rubbish and 1 fine:

--------------------   --------------------   --------------------

--------------------   --------------------   --------------------

Whenever your activity result is in question, grab 4 coins, shake them and smash on desk.

To succeed, a number of heads must match or exceed the task difficulty:
      0        |    1    |  2   |   3    |     4     |  5   |  6
---------------+---------+------+--------+-----------+------+-----
automatic fail | trivial | easy | medium | difficult | hard | epic

You may reshake a coin once per every level of used skill.
Always use the most suitable skill.

You can reshake more coins at a time when using suitable item during task:

coins shaken |    1    |          2         |  3   |   4
-------------+---------+--------------------+------+------
item quality | no item | improvised/rubbish | fine | great

You get 1 additional coin for every helping person.
Reshake it using helperâ€™s skill level.

Sometimes, when failing the task, you may lose 1 health per every tails.

Remember. We work unnoticed, protecting the weak.

                                                      London, 1893

Sometimes a limitation leads to unconventional solutions. Helsing's League accepts everyone who wants to live dangerous life during post-victorian era. Monsters are many and members of the league vanish too quickly. Help us to save the London!

PS: Hope you found an easter egg in the attribute list ;)
