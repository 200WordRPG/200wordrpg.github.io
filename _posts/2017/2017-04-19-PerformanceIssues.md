An actor portrays a multitude of characters in their career. What if they were recruited into a mercenary team together? It’s like the Expendable where the whole team is composed of multiple Stallones, or Arnolds, or...

WHAT YOU NEED
2-3 players (GM optional)
1d6 per player

MECHANICS
Players choose 3 characters from TV or Film who were portrayed by a single actor. (Eg. Eddie Murphy: Axel Foley, Prince Akeem, Pluto Nash)
Designate each character to an even and odd number. (Eg. 1-2=Axel Foley, 3-4=Prince Akeem, 5-6=Pluto Nash).
Describe the story. Meditate actions (combat or not) with dice rolls — roll a d6 to determine if you succeed with awesome (on Evens) or fail with humor (on Odds). (Optional rule: Never tell them the Odds. Just tell them how you fail.)
You can “flip your roll” to success if you impersonate the character in their actions or use a one-liner from their respective movies or television show.
Games can be cooperative or PVP against a foe or obstacle presented by the GM or other players.
