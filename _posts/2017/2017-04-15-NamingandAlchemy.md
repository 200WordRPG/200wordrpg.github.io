A game for 3 - 5 players.

Each player is an alchemist attempting to learn the “True Names” of the five elements: Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, and Aether. You win by learning all five names first.

Set Up:
One deck of tiles, which make up the board, and a starting tile
One corresponding set of tokens
One deck of material cards

At the beginning of the game, each player draws five cards from the deck of materials and places themselves on the starting tile. 

In a turn, a player can move one space in any direction. If there is no tile on the space where they moved, they draw one from the deck and place it. Each tile has an element and challenge assigned to it. The player must combine the material cards in their hand to beat the challenge. The other players judge if the combination works. If they beat the challenge, they gain a token, and can continue on their way, redrawing the material cards. If they cannot beat the challenge, they move back to the tile they started the turn on. A player learns the True Name of an element by beating five challenges of the corresponding element.
