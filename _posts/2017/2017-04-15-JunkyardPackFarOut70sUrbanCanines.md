This is an actual functioning RPG about dogs getting by in the big city (or anyplace you want to be a dog). Great small kids role play game or expand into more adult themes. Play out your favorite canine cartoons or shows. I plan to expand it a bit and publish it through Indie Press Revolution after the contest ends.
