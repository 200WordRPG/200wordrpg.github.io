A supplement for BlackHack-based games
Every character starts with a d20 Risk die. Every day the character kills a sentient humanoid creature they role the risk die.
The first time they fail they must choose the path of either Remorse or Hatred.
Once they have chosen a path, each time the risk die ticks down: Remorse, create a rule of behaviour around killing that justifies it in your character's mind, e.g. refuse to draw your sword first, pray for each of the souls you take; Hatred, choose one species you have killed since the last time your Risk die ticked down to join the creatures you hate, your character wages a genocidal war against their hated species, seeking to kill non-combatants, destroy settlements, poison water supplies and so on.
Once the risk die is exhausted: Remorse, the character retires from a life of violence; Hatred, the character is no longer interested in pursuing any goal except their hate and refuses to interact with those who donâ€™t share their beliefs.
