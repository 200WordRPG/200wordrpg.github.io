You are the crew of the Lucky Star, a magic-fueled spaceship held together by equal parts imagination and duct tape.

Pick a vocation:
     -psychic
     -warrior
     -priest
     -thief

Pick a job:
     -captain
     -boatswain
     -navigator
     -cook

To resolve conflicts, roll 2d6 and add one if your vacation/role applies or two if both do.  If the result’s from 7-9, you succeed and pick a complication.  If it's 10+, you don't pick a boon.

Complications:
    -Someone's hurt
    -Something's lost
    -It gets weirder

Traveling through space gets weird real quick. Weird starts at two and increases by one when a conflict is resolved and the 'It gets weirder' complication is selected.  If your unmodified 2d6 roll is <= the weird, it's a failure. If your roll's 10+ and > weird, you can receive a complication and reduce weird by one.  At weird 12, the Lucky Star and its crew become so improbable they are wiped from existence.

The admiral’s a special player who controls everything except for player characters. 

They canNOT:
     -railroad
     -deus ex machina
     -restrain the weird
     -bore the players
```

MSA is supposed to be a PBtA Spelljammer parody that really embraces the weird.
