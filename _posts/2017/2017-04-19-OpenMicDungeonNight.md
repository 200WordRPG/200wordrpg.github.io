```
Poet mages are here gathered
To tell of dungeons mastered

One at a time on stage
Who’s the best rhyming sage?

On many slips of paper
We will compose our caper

Thirty single word challenges
Could be blocking the passages

Put them in a box
How unorthodox

Five single word spells
Wizard’s materials

Take a challenge from the box
This will be the next hard knocks

With four lines of rhyming verse
Describe how affairs aren’t worse

Rhyme the spell you must
To power the thrust

The challenge is best rhymed
So the blow will be well timed.

Avoid repeating any rhyme
Each only works the one time

Five verses end the story
Are we laudatory?
```
