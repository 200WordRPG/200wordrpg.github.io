You are bio-commandos infiltrating the Machine-Monk’s temple to rescue your legion’s War-Womb.

Objectives:
Deny them the war-womb.
Recover the war-womb.
Destroy the temple.

One player’s the Machine-Master, controlling the temple’s defences. Roll on both three times:

Unaugmented
Flesh-and-metal
Mind-slaving
Auto-evolving
Virtual
Mecha

Knights
Hunters
Labyrinths
Engineers
Armouries
Bishops

Baseline humans have no chance. You have certain advantages:

Your Mutations:
4 ganglia: Sever 1 to hypnotise, scry, hack.
Roll [ganglia]d6s to sense environments/coerce others.

4 digits: Sever 1 to fire a burrowing projectile. 
Roll [digits]d6s to use dexterity/precision.

4 blood: Spend 1 to heal mortal wounds/get +1d6.
Roll [blood]d6s to understand/resculpt flesh.

4 limbs: Sever 1 to make an explosive. 
Roll [limbs]d6s to use speed/force.

When rolling take the highest:
6:	Success. Give next commando to roll +1d6.
4-5:	Success. You’re drained/vulnerable.
1-3:	Failure. Reinforcements arrive/you take a mortal wound.
At 0d6 roll 2d6, pick lowest.

Machine-Master: say the Temple’s response, gives another commando a threat or opportunity, and ask what they do.

When you salvage Machine-Monk flesh, restore 1 to a mutation but mark 1:
You can’t hear the squad’s thoughts.
You’ll reject further salvage.
The machinery is beautiful.
