Each player has a Player deck of 20 cards. They write one word on each. Each must: be a noun or verb, cannot be something overly ambiguous, and none can be synonyms or duplicates.

Each Player must also create 5-10 of each of the following: a Setting (a one word place like Dungeon, City), an Encounter (one adjective and noun; like Spiked Pit, Upset In-Law) and a Modifier that prevents certain cards from working (an adjective with explanation such as Angry (no Social cards), Disarmed (no items)). These are set into a pile for each that all players put theirs into.

Players shuffle their Player deck and draw 4 cards. Determine a Scene with one card from the Setting, Encounter, and Modifier decks. Each Player uses cards and explains how theyâ€™re used to get them through the Scene. Players can use their own cards to help others, and Players unable to pass a Scene are left behind. Used cards disappear. After a Scene is over, Players draw until they are up to 4 cards, and a new Scene is started.

Play continues until either there are no more Scenes (Victory!), or the players can do nothing more (Defeat).

Had to get rid of a couple examples and rule details to fit the count, so I hope it's clear enough. If anyone else submitting sees this, best of luck to you!
