For 3 to 6 players.

Players will take on the identity of a retail associate the GM is the General Manager of the establishment.

Players will each need a d6 & d10. 

Each player will start with 25 XP. If a player loses all of their XP they are fired.

GM will set challenges for each player to do either as a group or separately depending on the situation.

Customers
Players will roll a d6 versus customer roll. If a playerâ€™s roll is higher than the customer roll, the customer will walk away happy. XP received for each happy customer by rolling d10. If a customer walks away unhappy that player will lose 5 XP. If a player rolls a 1, GM makes a termination roll on d6. 6 = Fired.
