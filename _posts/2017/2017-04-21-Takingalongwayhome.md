```
A game to spend time and fill in long silences when walking with friends.
You will need
At least 1 music player - ideally one for every player
2+ players

Each person will be playing a character, based on first five songs to start playing in a shuffle mode.
First sentence to come up at or after 00:30 mark of the first, 1:00 of the 2nd, 1:30 of the third, 00:15 of the fourth and 00:45 of the fifth song will be the characterâ€™s main qualities. Instrumental songs can either be skipped or used to add an atmospheric depth to your character.
Stay in character until reaching your destination - farewells should also be done in character!!
Sample questions or topics include:
* The weather
* Politics
* Where you two met
* What are you doing next weekend
* Your five-year plans
* Will you ever meet again
For an extra challenge, you may mimic the artist from any of your characteristic songs
