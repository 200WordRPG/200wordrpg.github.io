```
You and your friend(s) go to an abandoned house. What does it look like?

Who are you? Answer these questions:
What have you heard about the house?
Why did you come?
Do you believe in ghosts?
What are you afraid of?

You split up to explore the rooms; of course you do.

Give each player five Fear tokens. Each player takes turns exploring. The person to their left plays the House. The House devours Fear.

A turn:
Player: Describe the room. Take your time. Consider all the senses. What is unsettling about it?

House: Describe the haunting. Take your time. Consider all the senses. What changes? Appears? Disappears?

Player: When do you reach your breaking point? How do you try to escape? Roll 1d6.
1-6 House narrates what happens and devours two Fear tokens.
7-9 Player narrates what happens, but House devours one Fear token.
10+ Player narrates what happens.

Fade to black. Rotate widdershins. Repeat.

When a player has no more Fear tokens, they are taken by the House and help narrate the Houseâ€™s turn. 
The last player with Fear token(s) after their turn escapes the House and narrates the epilogue.
If none escape, narrate it together.
