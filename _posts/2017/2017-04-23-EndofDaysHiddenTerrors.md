The world has ended. Your job? Survive and conquer.

Each player needs: one deck of cards, three tokens.

Cards represent actions: 
Spades – Mental
Hearts – Social
Clubs – Physical
Diamonds - Player's choice. Magic? Weapons? Cash?

Conflicts are CAPITALISED: Play a card, describe an action, your opponent reciprocates. Highest card wins CONFLICT. Aces High, Jokers Wild. Suits don't have to match, but actions must make sense.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Youngest player = Survivor. 
Player to their left = Narrator.
Remaining players = Terrors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Draw 6 cards. Play one face-down.

Survivor introduces their Character and objective. Narrator introduces scene.

Narrators HINDERS Survivor five times. Narrate each Hindrance/Outcome. 

Won the most Conflicts? Take one token from the other player.

Terrors only ATTACK when Survivors play card with same suit as Terror’s face-down card. Describe your Terror, then ATTACK. Won the Conflict? Take two tokens from the other player.

Rounds end when all Survivor's cards are used, or after Terror’s ATTACK. Roles rotate clockwise. Discard hand, redraw 6, play one face-down. 

No tokens? You cannot be a Survivor until you win some back. Narrate your deaths/escapes. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got the most tokens after 7 Rounds? You win! Conclude all stories. 

Who Survived? Died? Remained Terrors?

It’s in your hands…

A really dialled down version of a bigger RPG system I am writing called the 'Alchemy Roleplaying Toolkit' :) fun fact: this entry is 200 words, and 2000 characters long!
