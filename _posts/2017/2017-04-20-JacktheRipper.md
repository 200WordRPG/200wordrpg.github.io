In 1888, Jack the Ripper killed five prostitutes in London’s slums―and you’ve cracked the case! It was … Lewis Carroll.

No, really. Hidden anagrams in his writings prove it!

Gather three or more players. Set a timer for fifteen minutes. Fill a bowl with fake dollar bills. Find a book by Carroll. Pick five sentences from the book and make a list of them.

Start the timer. Each player rearranges the letters in the sentences to form new sentences that implicate Carroll in Jack’s crimes. You must use every letter from the original sentence in the new sentence(s) and cannot use a letter more times than in the original. Once you’ve decoded a sentence, grab a dollar bill and start on another one.

When the timer goes off, pencils down! Everyone reads off their list of anagrams, and the players vote on whether each one is a true confession. Majority rules. If an anagram is voted down, its player must return a buck to the bowl. 

Once everyone has shared their anagrams, start a new round. Play as many rounds as you wish. The winner is the player with the thickest bankroll at the end of the game.
