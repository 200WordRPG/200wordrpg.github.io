A Game of Heists and Hilarious Consequences

YOU NEED:
3-6 players, no GM
A die with the same number of faces as the number of players

MECHANIC:
When a player-character takes an action, they declare what they hope the result will be and assign it to the highest face on the die. 

(Player A says, “I detonate the explosives. On a 4, the bank vault door blows open.”)

Then they say, “What could go wrong?” and pass the die around the table. For each other face of the die, another player describes a different result. Each must be WORSE than the one before it.

(Player B says, “On a 3, the explosives don’t go off.” Player C says, “On a 2, they go off and trigger the sprinkler system.” Player D says, “On a 1, they go off and set all the money on fire.”)

Then the acting player rolls and discovers the true consequences of their action.

Before you play, you can use the same mechanic to define the elements of the heist, such as Target, Location, Attack Plan, and Getaway Plan. Each player suggests an idea for each element, and one player rolls to determine which to use.
