The game takes place in any possible scenery and point in time. It requires a minimum of 3 players, one of which is the guide. Can be co-op (players against NPCs) or PvP. Guide adds NPCs as required.
Players start with 100 hit points. When reaching 0 they are out.

Objective: eliminate the opposite team.

Mechanics:
1d10 for failure/success. 1, 2, 3 are failures. 4 to 10 are successes. The higher the best hit. 10 grants +2 bonus.
2d6 for damage taken/received.

The guide decides bonuses, penalties and hit based on the characters, their professions and background (special forces, soldier, police, medicâ€¦) given by the players.
Players narrate the encounter based on what the guide decided.

Weapons (damage is 2d6 +/- reported bonus):
Handguns: +3 from 10 to 25 meters. +4 close. -1 for every 5 meters after 26.
Shotguns: +5 from close. -1 for every 3 meters after 10.
Sniper rifle: +10 if expert. -5 if not. Not used in close combat.
Hands: +2. +5 if expert. -1 if upper body hit.

Guide decides what part of the body is hit.
Players describe tactics taken to win, combat options and anything compelling to the story.
