A roleplaying exercise for two players

Prep: Choose a genre and list a few types of characters you would expect in such a story. Pick one each to play and come up with a personal disagreement between these two characters.

Ready: Mark off the center and ends of a straight line at least twelve feet long.
Set: Choose opposite ends and stand equidistant between your end of the line & the center with your back to the center.

Go: In character, voice your opinion on the disagreement. Whenever your character wants to listen to the other, turn towards them. Whenever your character wishes they didnâ€™t have to listen, turn away. Whenever you feel closer to agreement, step towards the center. If you feel farther from agreement, step away from the center.

Finish line: Normal play ends when either player reaches their end or the center. Neither player can thenceforth speak, but the other player may immediately walk to the center or their end.
