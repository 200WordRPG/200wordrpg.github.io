You are a fidgety kid in a tight, restrictive classroom that has poor air ventilation that makes it torture to breathe or move. The kid must power up through each struggled breath to allow his body to power through the torture and start to fidget. The game goes until the kid is able to fidget to his heart's content and his body becomes extremely powerful and is able to crush universes and does. After this the game ends because all possible worlds are destroyed and are null and void.
Player count- one
Materials - torture classroom
How to play use your imagination to face off the struggles while the air crushes you
