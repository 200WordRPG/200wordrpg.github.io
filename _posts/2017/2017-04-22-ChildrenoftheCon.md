Player Roles:
Narrator: The referee tells the story and determines outcomes.  Fans: The other players. 

How to Play:
1. Create fans and figure out how they know each other.  
2. The Narrator sets up Part One, describing the convention and action and then giving each fan a scenario where they are the focus. 
The players and narrator tell a three-part story. Each character has one scenario per Part. Scenes take 5-10 minutes. 
3. In Part Two players describe the events of their scenario, but the narrator guides the story, adding complications and determining outcomes. 
If in doubt use a challenge of some kind (roll highest on 1d6, rock/paper/scissors, thumb war). Describe and move the story logically. 
4. In Part Three the narrator describes what happens to each fan. Players can demand challenges.
