2 players and a judge(s)

You need: 10 coins of same denomination and different years of minting

You are two SUPER POWERFUL SHAPESHIFTING WIZARDS. You hate each other.

Flip a coin to determine who goes first. Divide the ten coins evenly between the wizards. They then pocket the coins.

The starting player will draw a coin from their pocket. The final 2 digits in the year of minting determines which shape you shift into- pick from the list below with the two digits you have

1 Insect
2 Mouse
3 Sparrow
4 Ferret
5 Cat
6 Wolf
7 Eagle
8 Stallion
9 Bull
0 Elephant

Narrate which shape you shift into, and how you’ll defeat the opponent. Wizard 2 then does the same with a coin from their pocket, narrating how they defeat player one’s shape with their new shape.

Judge(s) then pick a winner based on narration. Discard coins, then Player 2 begins round 2 by drawing a new coin from their pocket and shapeshifting. Alternate who goes first each round. 

When no coins remain, winner of the most rounds wins and shapeshifts into a Dragon.

For added fun, do it in verse with a rap beat.

Inspired by the shapeshiting duels that crop up in mythology all the time (and in stuff like Sword in the Stone). Thanks to my RPG crew for feedback
