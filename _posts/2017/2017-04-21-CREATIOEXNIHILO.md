CREATIO EX NIHILO

The big bang, birth of gods, mythical ages, ancient civilizations...

Come together with one or more creative friends to create a collaborative fictional universe. Take notes on paper, index cards, smartphones, etc.

Spontaneous Creation
Starting with the First Cycle, take turns describing concepts, ideas, and stories to add to the fiction, assigning them points based on a three-point scale.

*** 3 = big ideas, more permanent, powerful
 ** 2 = medium
  * 1 = small

Players begin each round with 3 points each, and may spend them in any order. Altering another playerâ€™s creation costs 1 more point than originally spent.

Re-Cycle?
Once all players have spent their points for a round, as a group decide whether to move on to a new cycle or continue another round in the current cycle.

Advance
Moving to a new cycle indicates the passage of time, possibly eons, and a narrowing of focus, with ideas getting smaller in scope and impact. 

Sample Cycles
1st - Universal Laws
2nd - Elder Gods
3rd - Galaxy, Stars, Time
4th - Sun, System, Planets
5th - Prime Planet
6th - Additional Celestial beings
7th - Geography, Climate
8th - Flora, Fauna
9th - Intelligent races
10th - Age of Myth
11th - Civilization
...

Continue with Microscope or your favorite RPG.
