3-5 players

English haiku: a poem with three lines and syllable count of 5-7-5

Characters:

The land is overrun by demons. You are a glorious warrior!

Pick a Theme. Write a haiku about your splendour. 

Write a haiku, using another’s Theme, about your envy.

Play:

Pick two characters as focal characters. 

The other players create a Challenge together. Each writes a haiku detailing the Challenge using focal character Themes. 

Each focal character player secretly writes a haiku to defeat the Challenge. Pick one:
- Work together.
- Sabotage the other.

Reveal both haikus.

Both work together: 
- Challenge is defeated.
- Each writes a victory haiku and strikes one line from their warrior haikus.

Both sabotage:
- Challenge is undefeated.
- Each writes a shame haiku and strikes one line from their warrior haikus.

Only one sabotages:
- Saboteur defeats the Challenge and writes a victory haiku.
- Sabotaged character strikes one line from their warrior haikus.

When all lines from your warrior haikus are stricken, your warrior is dead. Choose one:
- Write a glorious haiku commemorating the death.
- Write a demon-inspired spiteful haiku. Any characters you choose strike one line from their warrior haikus.

Rotate to new focal characters.

End when one or none stands alive.

## Author Comments 

Thanks must be given:
though only a small gesture,
even nods warm hearts.

Jax Bryk, with stern gaze
as dauntless as spring’s coming, 
pushed me to write.

Albert Andersen
made a joke over ramen.
From soup springs haiku.

Brie Sheldon slashed
his sword-like pen and my craft
was honed by his strikes.
