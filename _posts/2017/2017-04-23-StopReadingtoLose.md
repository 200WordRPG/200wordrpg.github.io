Reading this is playing this.










































Don’t cheat. Go slow.











































You are in cryosleep.











































Why?











































Working?











































In here you don’t age.











































You remember leaving something behind.











































Tingles in your ear.











































You still love them?











































Feel your clothes. Your skin.











































What itches?











































You feel a breeze.











































Imagine home.











































Supposed to be air-tight.











































Feel your arm. Sticky.











































A training video about contaminants.










































 
Who screwed up?











































A growing headache.










































 
You ever seen a worm?










































 
Why are you in debt?


Try not to think about who you are letting down.











































Was the launch terrifying?










































Hum of the engines.










































Your job is to maintain something...










































Thin, piercing pain through your ear, through your head.










































pain










































hurts










































COILED










































You can stop playing, let go.











































Remember when you really got hurt.











































Clench your teeth, squeeze your eyes shut.











































Blurry, unfocused, you’re losing control.











































Do something else, this is just a dumb game.











































Picture who you did wrong to.











































Put yourself in their shoes, asshole.











































Obsess about this regret.











































Compare the two feelings.











































Something crawled in your ear.











































Why don’t you feel worse?











































You’re selfish.











































What’s the point?











































It’s gotta be in your head.











































It’s gonna get worse. 











































You fought off the worm. It dies in your head.
