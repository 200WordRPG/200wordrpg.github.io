```
You are playing a character that is just like you only measurably less anxious about things and slightly more competent. Everyone you meet today will be interacting with that character instead of you, as such all insults, judging looks and other abuse is part of an elaborate larp and should be ignored when you go ooc at the end of the day. Conversely any appreciation or compliments you get should still be taken to heart because roleplaying well is hard. Blue booking is encouraged as is helping new players with understanding their environment but do not go overboard as mistakes are part of the fun.  Remember debrief and aftercare are a must.

I strongly suggest playing this game in groups.
