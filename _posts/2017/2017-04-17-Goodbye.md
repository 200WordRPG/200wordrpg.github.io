```
2-4 players.
You need one coin.

It’s terminal. You have come to terms with it. You finally accept your death.
 
Join the others in your last meeting. Take a coin. Say your piece, pass it on.
In turn, share with the group, one;
Good memory.
Regret.
Goodbye.
 
5 years on, you all survived against the odds. Do you still accept death?

Each player tosses the coin.
On tails all is fine.
On heads, you have a lump. Test results are normal, everything’s fine. Don’t worry.
Meet with the other survivors.
Take the coin. Say your piece, pass it on.
Share with the group, one;
Bad memory.
Hope.
Fear.
   
10 years on, do you still accept death?

Face the other survivors.
 
Each player has the coin thrown for them. Do not throw your own coin. It’s not your fault. There’s nothing you could do. I’m sorry.

Say your piece, and pass it on.

On tails all is fine.
Explain why;
Keeping death close/afar was better/worse.
You resent the others
You feel guilty.
Say goodbye.
 
On heads you relapsed. You are dying.
Explain why:
Keeping death close/afar was better/worse.
You resent the others.
You feel relieved.
Say goodbye.
