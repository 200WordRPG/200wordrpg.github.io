A combat or skill resolution mechanic.

Each player draws 5 cards from a 52 card deck.  Anytime a ‘roll’ would be required, play 3 cards.  May choose 1, 2, or 3 cards from your hand before turning over the remainder from the deck.  Add the value of the cards displayed for a total between 3 and 39.  3’s and 39’s are criticals.    Draw back to a hand of 5.  Reshuffle discards when need a new draw.

Optional: may turn in a poker hand of 5 cards for a degree of epic success, being more epic the higher value of the poker hand.  Straight flush > 4 of a kind > full house > flush > straight > 3 of a kind.  2 pair and 1 pair are considered insufficiently awesome.

The GM should use a 2nd deck for monsters so that player and GM luck is balanced in separate pools.

An ace may be 1 or 11.   King = 13.  Queen = 12.  Jack = 11.  

Optional: Divide by 2 to map to 1d20.  Divide by 2 and discard kings to map to 3d6.

This allows for a player to save or build to one good 'roll' when they think they really need it.
