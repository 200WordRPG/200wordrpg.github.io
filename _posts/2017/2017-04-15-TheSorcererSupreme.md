```
THE SORCERER SUPREME sets a simple task for the PLAYERS.
They need to invent a SPELL that solves the task.
A SPELL is made of MAGIC WORDS.


No. - WORD - Definition
1 - Si - Trigger
2 - Magnitudine - Size
3 - Morphosia - Shape
4 - Ex-Nihil - Create
5 - Locatia - Location
6 - Emulus - Imitate
7 - Somateria - Object
8 - Injectiv - Insert
9 - Extractus - Extract
10 - Crescere - Increase
11 - Reducto - Reduce
12 - Transmutia - Convert
13 - Preventia - Prevent
14 - Vitalia - Life
15 - Vectora - Kinetics
16 - Luminus - Light
17 - Thermia - Heat
18 - Potentia - Electricity
19 - Chronos - Time
20 - Arcano - Magic

For each WORD in a SPELL, the PLAYER rolls a D20.
Roll - Result
20-16: Critical Success
15-6: Success
5-2: Failure
1: Critical Failure. Roll a D20.
The result corresponds to a new WORD that REPLACES the WORD you attempted to use.

Example
To save a cat from a tree, you try to shrink the tree.
REDUCTO - (Reduce)
MAGNITUDINE - (Size)
SOMATERIA - (Object)
Then roll 3 d20â€™s
The WIZARD rolls 10-17-2
Reduce (10): Something definitely gets reduced.
Size (17): Size is correctly targeted.
Object (2): Instead of the tree, the cat is selected.
The cat shrinks to the size of a mouse.

Then the next player tries a new spell!
