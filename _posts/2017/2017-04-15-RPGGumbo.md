Get a bunch of players and snacks. Each player must bring three of the crunchiest, dustiest, or hippiest RPG books they own. Make some characters. Shuffle the books and everyone takes one book. You must use physical copies, there should be plenty left. Whenever a rule is needed, all players search their one book for a relevant rule. The first person to find a relevant rule wins narrative control. The rule must be read aloud. You do not need to follow the rule to win. After each rule resolution, shuffle the books so that nobody has the same book twice.
