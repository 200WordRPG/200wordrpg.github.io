```
Character Creation: Roll 4d4 for stat points and distribute them between BODY and MIND to a minimum of 2 and maximum of 8. These are all the stats characters have. Players have 4 item slots and 1 weapon slot and can add anything to those slots with GMâ€™s discretion during character creation. Ammunition needed for a weapon uses an item slot. 

How to play: When a player wishes to take an action that player rolls a d12 against a stat the GM calls for. On a result less than the character's stat is rolled, the attempt is a success. On a result equal or greater than the stat, an additional point is added to the stat. Once either stat reaches 11 points, the character dies.

Sanity: When a character sees something their mind may not comprehend, a GM may call for a sanity check where a player rolls 1d10 and must roll higher than their MIND stat or add 1 point to that stat.

Damage:When a character takes damage, a GM may call for a Damage check where a player rolls 1d10 and must roll higher than their BODY stat or add 1 point to that stat.

I'd Like to thank Amanda, John and Dave for not bashing my first homebrew RPG. It wasn't this system, but it helped give me courage to write this one.
