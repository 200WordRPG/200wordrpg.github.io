TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS, DARKENING THE ROOM, EXCEPT FOR ONE TORCH/SCREEN/LAMP. 

You are mighty, the bravest daughter of your people. Your quest has brought you here, to a cave deep below the earth and full of dreadful things. The guardian of a great treasure stands here, barring your way. 

The guardian demands answers before you may pass. 

YOU MUST ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS ALOUD. 

You are a fool. Who are you?

You are a thief. What do you seek?

You are untested. Why are you worthy?

CONTINUE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, LOUDER AND LOUDER, UNTIL THE GUARDIAN FULLY UNDERSTANDS YOUR WORTH.

Years have passed since you carried home your treasure. The world is a darker place, and your loved ones have turned away. A memory comes to you during the cold night, and you must reckon with it before you may rest. 

YOU MUST NOW TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS, EXCEPT ANY REQUIRED TO READ. 

You have seen much. Who are you?

Your burdens are heavy. What do you seek?

You have come far. Why are you worthy? 

CONTINUE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, REACHING DEEP WITHIN YOURSELF, UNTIL YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND YOUR WORTH.

I was inspired to write this after encountering Incantation, by Merritt Kopas, when I needed it most.
