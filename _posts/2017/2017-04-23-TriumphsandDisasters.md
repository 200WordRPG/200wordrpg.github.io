IF

“If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same”

                             Rudyard Kipling

YOU

You reside in Victorian India. Write and share two sentences about your character:

1. Your most remarkable Triumph to date, about which you are self-effacing.
2. Your most regrettable Disaster thus far, about which you are stoical.

CAN MEET

Discuss and note your personal or common adversaries: dastardly individuals, diabolical societies, frightful locations, scandalous situations, any combinations.

WITH TRIUMPH AND DISASTER

Write two sentences to describe the possible consequences of a precarious undertaking which brings your character up against one or more adversary:

1. Triumph, fulfilling your desires and manifesting your virtues.
2. Disaster, thwarting your designs and exposing your frailties.

AND TREAT THOSE TWO IMPOSTORS JUST THE SAME

Toss a coin for your character:

Heads: Triumph.
Tails: Disaster.

Take it in turns to set the scene, and play out the events leading up to your character's Triumph or Disaster. Involve other players as allies or adversaries. Have them play their own characters where appropriate.

Keep a stiff upper lip, come what may. Record your Triumph or Disaster as experience.

For a solo game write all stages. Publish periodically.

Kipling's poem "If" has been a constant source of inspiration and motivation for me. Not least here, where it gave me the idea for this little game set in the adventure-rich world of Victorian India. I designed the game to explore the idea that failure is as important as success when telling stories together. 

Thank you to SageGenesis (https://youtu.be/gA_EJ2wsHfk) for his excellent tips on RPG design, which helped me to focus enough to get this into 200 words.
