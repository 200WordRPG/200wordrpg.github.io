All is quiet on the carrot farm, untilâ€¦ HYPER FLYING DEATH BUNNIES FROM MARS!!!
Needed to Play: one shuffled deck of cards per player, 20 tokens to represent carrots given to the farmer.
One player is the farmer trying to protect his carrot crop. All other players are bunnies trying to steal the carrots.
Each round, the players deal out three cards. Whichever player has the highest value card wins the round. In case of a tie, bunnies must Rock-Paper-Scissors to win. The farmer wins all ties. Play continues until all cards are dealt or the farmer has no more carrots.
The winning bunny must describe in elaborate, outlandish detail how they fly into the field to steal a carrot and take one carrot token from the farmer. If the farmer wins, they must describe in elaborate, outlandish detail how the bunnies failed to grab one of his carrots.
The bunny with the most carrots wins the game and must describe in graphic detail how they plot the downfall of the farmer. If the farmer wins, they must describe how they beat back the ravaging hordes of bunnies.
