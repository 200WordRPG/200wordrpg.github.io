## Author Comments 

Example of Gameplay:
[GM] – The King seems unimpressed by your request. What do you do?
[Player] – Can I persuade him?
[GM] – You can try. Tell me how you do it?
[Player] – I would like to sing him a Song – a song that I heard on the streets and talks about kingdom's poverty and misery.
[GM] – Right, that's a {social} action. To do that, you need the suit of Hearts. 
[Player] – Okay, I play this 7 of Hearts from my [Stamina] hand, since I'm a {Bard}, I get +3 from [class Bonus]. It's a 10!
[GM] – The King is touched by your performance (...)
