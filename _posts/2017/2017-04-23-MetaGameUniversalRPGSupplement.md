To be used with any RPG:

Exploits: To use an exploit, declare it, pay its cost, and roll a d12. You successfully use the exploit if you roll 12 minus your remaining EP. An exploit can only be used when its triggering event takes place.

Name (Cost)
Trigger
Effect

Exploit Points (EP): Begin each game session with 1 EP. When you “Fail” in game, roll a d12. On a 12, you gain an EP. Critical failures automatically earn an EP.

List of Exploits:
