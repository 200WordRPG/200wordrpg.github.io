inspirations:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/4zkem1/simple_game_idea/ - A game about cavemen.
* Microdot - https://github.com/brunobord/micro-rpg-catalog/blob/master/microdot.md - for the brutal but efficient d4 action resolution system.
* Jeu d'Troll - https://troll.jehaisleprintemps.net/ - a game I made for the french "250 words or less RPG", but this one was diceless and was involving trolls.
