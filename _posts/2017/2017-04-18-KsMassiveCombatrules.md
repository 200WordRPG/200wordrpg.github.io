KMC is a set of rules for any kind of massive combate.

You can add more special bonuses (like weapons, moral, etc).
If you are playing in a campaign and wish to use this rules, use the chars either as generals (with the general rules, adding +cha/social/int to that unit instead of +2) or as faction leaders (Adding rolls to entire faction). 

For space battles, you can have a d100 representing a mothership that releases smaller d4 sized ships (and alter the terrains to 'asteroid field', 'near a blackhole' etc), for instance.
