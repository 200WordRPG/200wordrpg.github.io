A few remaining dragons exist on U.S. National Badlands Preserve, and the National Guard is charged with keeping them from wandering onto neighboring ranches. Your team arrives for their 10 day training exercise, eager to prove themselves against the ancient beasts.

YOUR TEAM
   Teams arrive with (TEAM=2) and (EQPT=2), but stats change with each mission:
                Name:
                    -- TEAM=
                    -- EQPT=
                    -- HUNT=
               Dragons:

EACH DAY
    Armed with electrostatic lances,  soldiers pile into an armored Humvee and depart hoping to encounter a dragon. Their first mission is PATROL.

        --  Roll (2d6) WHITE and (2d6) RED
        --  Select any two dice and total for outcome (see chart)
        --  Describe events in a paragraph
        --  Remaining RED dice may increase stats based on mission:
                   1-3 = +0
                   4-5 = +1
                    6   = +2
