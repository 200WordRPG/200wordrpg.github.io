One player is the Control, the rest are Cold War era sleeper agents in █████████. Game begins now. Identify by codenames ONLY. 

Agents, listen to your broadcast(1) for an encoded message. Copy the numbers to a single sheet ██ ███████. Note each repeated numbers group only once (see ███████ ). The Mission Objective will be given by Control at █████████.

███████ Cross off 5 or below to ask Control about a mission detail. 
Cross off 6+ to introduce detail about ██████████, your character (equipment, specialization, ████████ ) or the mission.

Control introduces and narrates scenes ███████ ██████ ██████████ █████

When outcome isn’t certain cross off a number and roll a d10. Add both. Total of 14 or greater is a success. 8-13 is a success at a cost. Anything below fails - cross off the first available number. 

Complete the objective to successfully finish the mission. Agents narrate an epilogue.
If all the numbers are crossed off, the mission fails. Control narrates how. 

[1] Find a broadcast on http://youarelistening.to/numbers, http://priyom.org/number-stations/station-schedule or by other means as ██████████ ██ ██████████.
[2] ██ ███ █████ ██ ████████ ██████ under any circumstances.

## Author Comments 

I just listened to a ███████ 99pi about number stations and wanted to turn it into a ████. The fact that ███ Word ███ █████████ started the next day gave me the motivation to actually do it. ██████!
