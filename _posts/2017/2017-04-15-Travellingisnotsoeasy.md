```
Take or make a map of your (fantasy or reality) city. Overlay a grid of hexagons; scale it such that it takes 1 hour to walk between hexes (or 20 minutes to ride or drive).

You have a destination (where?) that should be reached soon (why?).

Every three hexes walked (9 ridden), you must eat (how?).
Every nine hexes walked (27 ridden), you must sleep (how?).

Every hour, there is a chance of finding something entangling. Roll a six-sided die (d6), then ask the person to the right of the last person asked.

[1] Someone/something tells you that something important or useful (what?) is just up ahead.
[2] Someone who owes you something (or who is bound to you by honour) is seen. Do you try to avoid them?
[3] There is something valuable (what?) nearby (where?), but it is moving away (why?).
[4] There is something dangerous (what?) nearby (where?), and it is moving towards you (why?).
[5] Someone to whom you owe something (or who is bound to you by hatred) is seen. Do you try to avoid them?
[6] Someone/something tells you that you should never come back here (why not?).

Good luck.
