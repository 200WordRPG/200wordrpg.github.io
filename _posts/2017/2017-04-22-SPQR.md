Split the players into two teams. Each team must decide upon a Dictator. If there is a disagreement over who becomes the Dictator, declare both players Co-Dictators. Each Co-Dictator has a veto on the otherâ€™s actions.

Begin by consulting the sacred chickens: All players roll 1d6. If all players roll a 3 or above, the chickens feed, and the Battle begins. If a player rolls below a 3, the chickens do not feed, and all players re-roll.

If the sacred chickens do not feed three times, a Dictator may renounce their gods, rolling 1d6. If they roll a 6, the sacred chickens are thrown overboard and the Battle begins. If the Dictator rolls a 5 or below, they are assassinated by their soldiers, and their team loses the Battle.

Once in Battle, begin a Skirmish. Both teams play rock-paper-scissors. Defeated players are removed from the Field until one team emerges victorious. If a Dictator is defeated, their team loses the Skirmish, regardless of how many players remain on the field.

If a team loses three Skirmishes, they are routed from the field, losing the Battle.

If five Skirmishes pass and neither team wins, retreat to your camps for winter.
