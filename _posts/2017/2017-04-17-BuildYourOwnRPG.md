| 1 |            Characters have 3 unwavering principles. For important actions, roll 1d6. You succeed on 4+. Sacrifice a principle (before rolling) for +2.               |
| 2 |                For important actions, roll 1d6. Success thresholds vary by method: Violence (2+), Deception (3+), Confidence (4+), Compassion (5+).                  |
| 3 |                  Create 5 NPC bonds each. After important actions, roll 1d6 to test a bond: 1–2, it breaks; 3–4, it changes; 5–6, it strengthens.                    |
| 4 |                 Each player has 3 tokens. For important actions, you only succeed if someone else spends 1 token. At 0 tokens, your character dies.                  |
| 5 | Each scene, draw cards for starting emotions (heart = bitterness, club = horror, diamond = sympathy, spade = suspicion) and intensity (two = lowest, ace = highest). |
| 6 |                       Characters have 5 vices, numbered 1-5. For important actions, roll 1d6. If you roll a vice’s number, you must indulge it.                      |

I love creating tables, and I love creating small RPGs. As though the 200-word limit wasn't enough, I decide to restrict myself further. The longest single RPG possible in this document is 32 words.

However, using d6 tables for each element allowed me to indulge myself by painting in all of my favorite genres.
