IN THE PIT

Each of the players represents a faction of the Humanity survivors of The Final War and the GM will be a narrator who will maintain consistency between sessions.

PREPARATION OF A CAMPAIGN

Each player writes less than 200 words describing their faction and their desires for the Future Humanity. The GM, at this stage, may make recommendations for the credibility and fun of the story.

EACH GAME SESSION

A maximum decision time is established, after which it will be necessary to vote.

Exposure:
The GM presents a global problem to the players the Survivor and explains the problems derived from the lack of a decision.

Discussion:
The GM acts as moderator in an open debate until the appointed time.

Vote:
The representatives vote on what action to take, only to be approved by a qualified 3/4 majority

Conclussions:
The GM describes the consequences of the decision taken or untaken which will be noted in the 'Diary in the Pitâ€™. The consequences will be taken into account for the following game sessions.

END OF CAMPAIGN
The campaign will end when the Survivors leave the Earth into space or all have died.
