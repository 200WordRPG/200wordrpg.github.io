## Author Comments 

A knowledge of the 2-player game "7 Wonders Duel" is required for this history creation game. It is being entered into the 200 Word RPG Challenge (https://200wordrpg.github.io/), but is expected to be marked "low" accordingly, as it's really there only for those that understand the 7 Wonders Duel game, and will use this as an accompaniment.

Because of word limitations, the Example Play section only shows the Empire, Capital, and Leader are created for each player. The 4 Aspects are not shown here, but would otherwise normally be part of play, and could be modified, removed, or added to during an action, as appropriate.
