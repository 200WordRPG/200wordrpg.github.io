```
Your first full moon was rough, but your second felt...good. The transformation, strength, freedom, the connection to nature and friends, the songs.
It's a new moon now and you and a packmate miss the full moon. Get together over seven days to remember.
Sunday, you change: Change something about your outfit, makeup, appearance.
Monday brings strength: Destroy something. Shred some paper. Snap a branch.
Tuesday, celebrate your wild nature: Do something you've never done before. Big and important or small and minuscule- No one's watching but the moon.
Wednesday reminds you of the forest: Lay in the grass. Take a walk. Reconnect to nature.
Thursday is spent with your pack: Let your packmate know you appreciate them and will protect and support them. You're in this til the last hunt.
Friday night is a celebration: Howl and sing with your packmate. Pick a song you both love or write something new and untamed.
Saturday, you change back: Return to human form. Replace what you changed about your appearance at the beginning of the week.
The next full moon comes in a few weeks. Lycanthropy or not, every experience is transformative. You're not the same wolf you were this morning.
