Gather 1 to 3 friends. 

Write these five descriptions on notecards:

Comedy
Your turn: Narrate a scene that puts your character(s) in an absurd situation.
Other’s turns: Add ridiculous details to the scene.

Romance
Your turn: Narrate a scene that puts your character(s) in a exciting situation.
Other’s turns: Add mysterious details to the scene.

Action
Your turn: Narrate a scene that puts your character(s) in a charged situation.
Other’s turns: Add dangerous details to the scene.

Horror
Your turn: Narrate a scene that puts your character(s) in a frightening situation.
Other’s turns: Add menacing details to the scene.

Suspense
Your turn: Narrate a scene that puts your character(s) in a tense situation.
Other’s turns: Add ominous details to the scene.


Collectively, pick 1+(# of players) notecards and distribute randomly.

Together, create one or more protagonists and a starting location. 

Choose a player to narrate the first scene.

When it is your turn, play toward your theme but leave room for input from the other players.

On another player’s turn, look for ways to add details without over-shadowing the current player’s theme.

Play as long as you like; at least once around the table.
