```
the fuel is gone
and you are all so very
alone
except
except
something else is on board
something moves from room to room
submit to the horror
else die as oxygen depletes
 
if you all die the ship drifts endless
submission could save you
if it knows of other fuel sources
or it could just fucking kill you
 
one plays it - begins in DOCKING AREA or ASTEROID CLAMP
player decides it’s motivation, physique, technology and powers
mark movement secretly & honestly
be terrifying and mysterious.
 
the others are the crew, fill from top:
CAPTAIN - shot himself dead in bridge
NAVIGATOR - responsible for this
ENGINEER - once kept the ship running
MINERS - desperate enough for the dangerous work
