"Only you can save us," an older version of yourself said.  "I didn't, but you can." He handed you a book and a die as he faded away.  Passages were missing from the book, but you could infer your nemesis was erasing your existence; the die would allow you to move through time to stop him from interfering with your temporal selves as they faced critical challenges.

REQUIRED

Pencil, Paper, d6, cards.

NEED TO KNOW

--Aspects--

Clubs = Physical
Hearts = Social
Diamonds = Spirit
Spades = Mind

--Subjects--

2 - Faith
3 - Pride
4 - Gain
5 - Elements
6 - Mystery
7 - Bravery
8 - Loss
9 - Health
10 - Persistence
J - Poison
Q - Horror
K - Power
A - Control

--Resolution--

6+ = Yes, and gain a Trait with no bonus
4-5 = Yes
3- = No, and -d6 Stability

Traits: +3 bonus once/game.
Traits mitigate harm; -1 from next roll/damage and Trait is lost.

SETUP

Describe character; choose 2 Traits/Aspect

10 (Temporal) Stability

START

Deal 13 cards/hand, face down.  Flip card, describe challenge using Aspect/Subject.  Describe action, resolving with a d6. 

END

After four hands narrate your win, or if stability drops to zero/lose all traits in an aspect, your erasure from history.
