You are children's toys acting out a child's fantasies.

Needed: 
    1 Magic 8-Ball
    3-5 people
    one d6 (optional)

As a table choose a Setting.
Each player chooses a Toy and a Role.

You may create your own Setting, Toys, and Roles, or roll below.

One player must play as the Villain and proclaims their evil goals to start the game. 

Players take turns framing Scenes that involve 1+ toys and a defined conflict. Once the Scene reaches a climax, ask the Magic 8-Ball a yes/no question about the conflict (e.g. does the cowboy catch the rustlers?). React to the answer appropriately. It is acceptable to end on a cliffhanger.

A Story has 3 Acts, and an Act consists of each player framing one Scene. The villain's scene goes last. Act 1 establishes conflict. Act 2 escalates danger. Act 3 resolves the story.

Settings

1 - Cowboys
2 - Astronauts
3 - Knights & Wizards
4 - Dinosaurs
5 - Pirates
6 - Cops & Robbers

Toys
 
1 - Stuffed animal
2 - Puppet
3 - Action figure
4 - Doll
5 - Vehicle
6 - Etch-a-sketch
 
Roles
 
1 - Hero
2 - Love interest
3 - Sidekick
4 - Authority figure
5 - Voice of reason
6 - Villain
