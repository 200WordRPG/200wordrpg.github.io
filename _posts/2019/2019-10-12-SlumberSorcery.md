START:
- Introduce yourselves. You're all wizards & witches who've decided to go on a journey. Determine why, macro-level (what is the main objective of this journey?) & micro-level (what's in it for you, specifically?)
- Venture off. Roll a d6 whenever the group's conversations become stale, figure out what event happens based on the table below:

                                          | ROLL |         EVENT         |
                                          |------|-----------------------|
                                          |  1   |         enemy         |
                                          |  2   |         trap          |
                                          |  3   |    traveler (good)    |
                                          |  4   |    traveler (bad)     |
                                          |  5   | traveler (mysterious) |
                                          |  6   |         loot          |

EVENTS:
- When encountering an event, get creative with what it means & what will happen.
- Once your party has determined what exactly is going on, it's time to cast your spells (if need be).
- Each player says what spell they'd like to cast (from table) & why.
- Sleep IRL.
- Wake up, think back to your dreams.
- Consult table below:

                      |     DREAM      |               OUTCOME               |
                      |----------------|-------------------------------------|
                      |   good dream   |         spell-cast success          |
                      |   bad dream    |         spell-cast backfire         |
                      |    no dream    |            no spell-cast            |
                      | very odd dream |        spell-cast confusion!        |
                      |                | (group determines creative outcome) |

- Back at the table, group discusses their dreams & resolves the situation accordingly.
- Rinse & Repeat.


SPELLS:
       | ELEMENT |        TRAITS        |
       |---------|----------------------|
       |   ///   | electricity / energy |
       |   <3    |     love / trust     |
       |   ~~    |     wind / force     |
       |    o    |     water / adapt    |
       |   /-\   |    brain / control   |
       |    *    |  light / visibility  |
                                                            /\                  /\
                                                          _/__\_ SLEEP-TIGHT! _/__\_

Sleep is important! This game encourages you to take proper full rests. Wizarding is hard work after all!
