Four or more players are duelists, come for the final showdown. You have three moves. Go clockwise and name your move, then follow the instructions.

SWEAT: Describe your environment. How does the sand blow in the wind? How does the sun beat down on you? How does your weapon feel at your hip?
Take a red d6.

TEARS: Look another duelist in the eyes and establish a moment from your shared past. What were you, before? Friends? Family? Lovers? Linger on that moment, that time before now. Don't explain what went wrong- they already know.
Take two black d6es.

BLOOD: Look a duelist you have an established past with in the eyes, then they explain why you're wrong. I didn't know. You don't understand. It's not my fault. 
Then shoot them. You roll all your red dice and they roll all their black dice. If any values match across colors, both duelists recover all their dice of those values. Then, discard any remaining black dice and put any remaining red dice in front of the shot duelist.

If you have three or more red dice in front of you, speak your last words, then die.

Only one duelist can leave.

Ayo, I just started publishing my projects publicly recently and wanted to thank this challenge for being a major inspiration to do so. There's a slightly prettified version of this up on https://rathayibacter.itch.io/sweat-tears-blood, and if you play it be sure to let me know how it goes! Thanks again to everyone involved.
