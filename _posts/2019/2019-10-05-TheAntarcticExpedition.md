```
A GM-less horror storygame for 2 to 5 players. You are members of an expedition to Antarctica and discover an eon-old artifact in a cave a dozen metres below the ice. What will happen to you?

The Setting
Decide on the era, your gear and the actual goal of the expedition. Prompts: undiscovered local tribe, Victorian British explorers, modern-day scientists, visitors from another planet

Your characters
Each player describes their character in a few words, revealing their calling and discernible personality. Additionally, they privately decide how their character benefits from the expedition. 

The game
Decide as a group how the expedition went so far. Prompts: losses, weird findings or encounters,  uneventful

What does the artifact look like? Does it react to you finding it? Does anything change? 

You have a few in-game hours to interact with the artifact and find out what happens. After each hour the artifact, your surroundings or you will exhibit a dramatic transformation--what is it? At the end of the last hour everybody describes a short epilogue for their character and where they finally end up after the expedition.

If anybody died, hold a moment of silence for them.
