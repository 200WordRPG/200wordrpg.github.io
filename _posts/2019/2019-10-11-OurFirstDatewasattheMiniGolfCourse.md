```
It's your first date. You're going mini-golfing.
Who are you? To each other? Why here?

Each of you guess who will win, don't reveal.

If your ball (choose one)...
-goes into the hole: Your date finds something endearing about you.
-hits your date's ball and ___ ends up closer to the hole... 
-their ball: you say something that your date finds charming. What is it?
-your ball: your date is offended by something you said offhand. What is it? How is it resolved?
-goes into a hazard: You overthink something small and decide it's a huge problem of yours. What is it?
-bumps an obstacle: you try to make an impression. How? Does it?

If you ___  on the winner and... 
-agreed 
-were right: What made you go on a second date, was it the right choice?
-were wrong: For some reason you never went on a second date, where did you go from there?
-disagreed 
-were wrong: You made a choice to not go on a second date. Why? How did that play out?
-were right: You wanted to go on another date, but never did. What about them made you want to go on another?
