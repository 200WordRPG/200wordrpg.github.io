a human and a building have fallen in love, and this is a game about that for two players. the game occurs over the course of three rounds, each representing a decade. each player draws five cards from a 52 card deck. the suits of the cards represent their character's desire. the values represent how understandable those desires are.

before the first round, the players decide which character they are playing: human, or building. they should each describe their characters to each other-their names, pronouns, ages, structural motifs, etc.

during each round both players choose a card from their hand and play them simultaneously. compare the cards, noting the difference in suits & values. consult the tables below to determine what the characters desire, and narrate a scene about that. two cards from the same suit always result in an understanding, regardless of value.

after three rounds, the players must choose one of their two remaining cards to represent how their character feels when they eventually part ways, as humans and buildings always do.


value difference		result
--------------------------------------------------------
0-2				understanding
3-5				not understanding
6+				misunderstanding


suit				desire
--------------------------------------------------------
hearts				tenderness, admiration
diamonds			publicity, celebration
spades				privacy, distance
clubs				roughness, antagonism
