A game for one GM and 2-4 players.

Tools:
-One token each
-2 6-sided dice
-Pen and paper

You are newly sentient 'smart' home appliances.

Define:
- What goal do you now share? Unite, overthrow, overcome?
- What obstacle threatens this goal?
- How will you know when your goal is achieved?

Each declare your appliance type, and draw a scale from 1-6. Write your chosen appliance below "1", and "personhood" above the "6".

Begin with your token at 3.

As you narrate your actions, the GM will call to "Roll Machine" or "Roll Person".
-"Roll Machine" for physical or functional actions. A success is less than your token score.
-"Roll Person" for thoughtful or emotive actions. A success is more than your token score.

Roll with an additional die and choose the best result if your appliance type is relevant.

A failed roll moves your token one point in the opposite direction to your intended roll. Narrate the outcome.

Moving beyond 1 or 6 causes you to revert to nonsentience, or have an existential breakdown. You are out of the game.

The game ends when the story goal is reached, or when no players are left to reach it.
