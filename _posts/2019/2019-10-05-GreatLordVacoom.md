You all dogs and one of you is worst nightmare, Great Lord Vahcoom, giant wind god capable of producing immense loud noise and sucks up everything in path. Great lord wrecks havoc in domain RUFFly once a week and seems to take control of  human master until satisfied.

Before game begins, dogs will write down their most prized possession(do not actually need to possess it and it should be something a dog would prize) choose 20 words and write them down. 

On your turn, another player start stopwatch and you begin praising great lord, talk about why your possession is more important and why everyone else's is less important, and tell tale from past life only using the 20 words. Say stop when you're done.

 If speech lasted more than 2 minutes or less than 1 minute, 30 seconds or did not meet requirements, great lord kills you. If great lord likes praise, you get extra life. If players including great lord unanimously agree that your argument or tale not good, subtract 1 extra life(cannot kill you). 

Free words: Me, You, name of your possession

Be last dog to survive. 

Great lord always win.

Praise great lord.
