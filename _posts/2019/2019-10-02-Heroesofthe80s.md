The player characters are actionheroes from the 80's.

One person is the director and controls the villains, describe the scenes and outcome.

Phases of the game:

1. Going clockwise the players in order choose 1 thing from the list below and elaborate it. The first players choice is the actual threat that must be defeated at the end. The other choices are obstacles or scenes leading to the end. 

Terrorists with nukes
Giant laser
The President is hostage
Evil Robots
Lasersharks
Gene-manipulated Monkeys
The Girl with the silver dagger
Orbital array
Predator
Dread Gazebo
Submarine


2. The players describe their hero to the other players. Stereotypes are superOK!

3. The director describes the scenes and the players describes the actions of their heroes. Remember that the actual threat is the last scene. 

Each hero starts the game with 2 heropoints.  When performing an action the hero succeed if he uses a heropoint. If he chooses to fail, he instead gain a heropoint. The heroes cannot die unless they sacrifice themselves for the others. Then all other heroes gain a heropoint.  

To defeat the final threat each remaining hero must be able to spend 2 heropoints. Otherwise evil prevails.
