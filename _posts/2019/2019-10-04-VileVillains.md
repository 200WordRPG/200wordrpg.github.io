1 GM, 3 Evil Players.

If you have 0 HP at turn start, roll a d6. On a 1, you die. HP can't go negative.

At combat start, roll a d6 + HP, going highest -> lowest for turn order.

To attack (1 attack per turn), roll a d6 against a target within range ('target:') they roll too. If you roll lower, nothing happens. Otherwise, you damage it.

You can move 30ft per turn.

Players:

-Deathknight. HP 5. You have a sword (3 damage, target: within 5ft). When it kills, you regain 1 lost HP.

-Blasphemer. HP 4. You have magic gifted from a god (2 damage, target: sight). You can heal 2 lost HP to a target you can see in addition to attacking, you must kill to heal again.

-Necromancer. HP 3. You have innate magic (1 damage + 1 curse, target: sight). You make a friendly zombie by touching a corpse instead of attacking.

    Curses:
      - Next attack automatically hits it.
      - Next attempted attack does double damage against it.
      - Subtract 2 from its next attack roll
