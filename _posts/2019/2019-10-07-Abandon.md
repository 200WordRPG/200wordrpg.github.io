This game is about the tension of partying with intentions, set inside a nightclub. 

Each player sets a goal they want to achieve. The GM adjudicates.
 
Each character has a list of 10 adjectives, corresponding to their mood: 
 
1. Joyful 
2. Confident 
3. _____ 
4. _____ 
5. _____ 
6. _____
7. Insecure 
8. Intoxicated 
9. Resentful 
10. Dejected
 
Blanks are custom.
 
To resolve a challenge or move a scene a player may either: 
-roll a d10 to determine a mood. 
-choose a mood, and burn it. 

The player and GM then explains how their character's mood is used to impact events.

A burned mood may not be used again. If rolled, the result takes +1. 
 
At any time, a player may offer a mood to another, either traded or gifted. If accepted, the mood is removed, written secretly on a piece of paper, and passed over face-down. This replaces an entry on the recipient's list, their choice.

Recipients may either:
-turn it over, which triggers it and burns it.
-leave it until a roll reveals it. 

Once a mood is revealed, players should explain how their characters' interactions determine the outcome.  
 
Play continues until a player has achieved their objective, or is burnt out.
