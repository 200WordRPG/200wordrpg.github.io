```
Setting: as desired.
Deck of cards needed for each player.
Select any 15 cards between 1 (Ace) and 5. The sum of the selected cards should not exceed 10. Add one Joker, one King and one Jack. 
Heart: Charisma
Club: Strength
Spade: Agility
Diamond: Intelligence
Shuffle your cards. When making a skill check, the GM determines the difficulty between 1 and 5 (1 = easy; 5 = difficult), draw the top card, and keep drawing until you draw the appropriate suit. If you drew => the difficulty, you succeed; otherwise, you fail. Keep the cards you drew in a discard pile.
If you run out of cards while drawing, reshuffle discards, take the top card, face down, and set it aside in a "dead" pile, then continue. 
Kings are an automatic success; Jokers are an automatic failure. 
Jacks mean something interesting happens, good or bad (determined by GM).
Suits do not matter for Jacks and Kings.
Health is your deck: if you are hit, take the top undrawn card and set it aside, face down, in the "dead" pile.
If you heal/rest, take one random "dead" card and reshuffle into your deck. You may never look at cards in the dead pile.
