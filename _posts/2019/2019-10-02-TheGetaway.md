The heist went wrong, you got the goods, but you need to escape. A GM is required.

Everyone describes their character. What makes you useful?

Everyone decides on the following: 
What was the heist? 
How did it go wrong? 
What's the current getaway plan? 
Who is chasing you?

Take the face cards and jokers from a deck of playing cards, shuffle them and place them on the table. Everyone takes one, The players with Jokers are undercover agents. The remaining are removed.

Lastly, shuffle the remaining cards. Players are dealt five cards from the deck face-up. These are Stamina cards

If you do something dangerous and/or the outcome is unclear, roll 1d10. If you get an 8 you succeed. You can turn a card 90 degrees and add it's value to the roll. You exert yourself to accomplish your goal.

If you are badly hurt, turn the highest remaining card.

When all stamina cards are turned, you die.

An undercover agent can reveal their card during any roll and automatically pass. Now everyone knows who's side they're on.

Play starts at the point the heist went wrong.

Play ends when every character dies or escapes.

The undercover agent(s) do not need to be with the group chasing the players. Nor do they need to be working together!

Sadly I do not have anything plug.
