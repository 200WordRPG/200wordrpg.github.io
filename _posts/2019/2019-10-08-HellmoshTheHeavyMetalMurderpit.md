In a horrifying world, test your Metal and fight to survive!
Turn it up, this goes to 11!

Poker deck with jokers, separate ace/face cards, shuffle rest.

Axes (spades) = Mystical / Guitars
Pipes (hearts) = Social / Vocals
Keys (diamonds) = Mental / Keyboards
Skins (clubs) = Physical / Drums

Name Band and Band members/Roles.
10 points per character among Suits (nothing below 2).
Name Specialty in Role's Suit, gain +1 when using.

Attack/Defend = describe, identify Suit, play cards from deck until anything offsuit's drawn, add card values to character's Suit score (+ Specialty if used).
Meet/beat Target (or draw Joker) = Success (Target takes Hit on Attack)
Under = Failure (character takes Hit on Defend; 3 Hits = character death).
Band Attacks first, then if any Targets left, Band Defends before next Attacks.

Stage 1:  Shredheads = 4 jacks, 1 Hit / 1 Keys attack each, Target 8
Stage 2:  Screamsirens = 3 queens, 2 Hits / 1 Pipes attack each, Target 9
Stage 3:  Meltmutants = 2 kings, 4 Hits / 1 Skins attack each, Target 10
Final Boss:  Demondirge = 1 ace, 10 Hits, single Axes attack affects entire Band, Target 11

Defeat a Stage = all characters heal one Hit and add +1 to one Suit.
Thrash Final Boss = rule Hellmosh!

Thanks for checking out Hellmosh!

This mini-rpg can be played with or without a game master as players prefer.  It's most ideal for 4 players (assigning Band Roles across the 4 Suits); however, it can be played with any number of players.  For more than 4 players, the required Hits to defeat the Stages could be increased (if the game group agrees), perhaps with a minimum number of Hits required to defeat Stage 1 equal to the number of players, and then increasing that number by 2 for each subsequent Stage.

For best results, make the action as over the top, outlandish, and unabashedly Metal as you can muster.  Enjoy!
