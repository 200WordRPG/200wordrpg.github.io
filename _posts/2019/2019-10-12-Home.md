Your planet is dying. 

You are a team of researchers sent to assess if Earth can be a new home where your few remaining people could peacefully settle. Disguised as regular Earthlings, you will clandestinely collect data on this peculiar place and its inhabitants. During the game, discuss your findings and reach a conclusion.

To start, name your researcher, then select 2 descriptors to guide role-playing them:
-Optimistic
-Pessimistic
-Scientific
-Philosophical
-Anthropological
-Idealistic
-Cynical
-Pragmatic
-Other?

Create a group chat accessible to all players. Over an agreed upon timeframe (1-3 days?) talk with your fellow researchers, detailing your observations to them using text, pictures, audio, whatever. Players may use their real-world observations to guide their role-playing (don't identify real people without permission). 

During play, allow the following to emerge in conversation if/when appropriate:
-What's happening to your planet?
-How has it affected you? 
-What there can never be replicated? 
-How is Earth beautiful/intriguing? 
-How is Earth terrifying/strange? 
-What will those you love think of Earth?

To conclude, discuss:
-What you learned about Earth.
-If Earth is a suitable new home.

Collectively, write up your formal recommendation.

Afterwards, consider what you, the player, learned from your observations.
