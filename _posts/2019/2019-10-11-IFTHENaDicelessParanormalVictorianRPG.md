```
	How do actual people deal with the mechanical empire of Victoria, mingled with the moralistic horror of Robert Louis Stevenson and Rudyard Kipling? When social order is tyranny and deviation is demonic, what is a paranormal investigator to do?
Characters distribute 15 points across 4 attributes: Logic (costs double), Quickness, Perceptiveness, and Vitality. Players can petition the referee for a special ability and corresponding disadvantage.	
	Characters attempting feats of skill, observation, and the like compare the relevant attribute to a difficulty threshold assigned by the referee. Three is average. No rolling is involved. If you have a low perceptiveness, you're going to miss most potential clues.
Danger and confrontations: Each round you write your main action. For each point of logic, write a conditional If/Then statement to respond to an action you think another person might do. In descending quickness order, people perform their main actions. If this triggers If/Then statements, those interrupt it. If one action has multiple responses, resolve in descending quickness order.
Injuries give -1 vitality. At 0 you are incapacitated or dead. An exception: bullets put you down in just one or two hits.
