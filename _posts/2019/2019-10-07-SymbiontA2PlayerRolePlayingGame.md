Requirements: 2 people, several quarters and a six-sided die (D6).

One player is a Symb, a virtually presenced advice giver. The Symb shares their host's senses, but is strictly a passenger. The other is the Game Master (GM) who describes the situation, plays the client and referees the resolution.

Symb Creation

Play

Players both ante $0.50.

The GM rolls for and describes the engagement. The Symb describes how they help, identifies a relevant skill and rolls a D6. The roll is modified by +3 for Great, +2 for Good and -1 for Terrible.

The GM narrates results:

1-4: Failure. Gain $0.50.
5-6: Success. Gain $0.75.
7-8: Exceptional. Gain $1.00.
9+: Extraordinary. Win the Jackpot!

Players swap roles after each engagement. Unearned bounties accumulate as the Jackpot. Engagements should be quick and memorable!
