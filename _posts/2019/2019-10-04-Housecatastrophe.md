1 GM/human & (n) player cats

Player cats each take distinctive breed and colouring to differentiate them.

Breeds: shorthair, moggy, Maine Coon, Persian
Colouring: ginger, tabby, blue, tortoiseshell, black, white

Action (d10):
1 Push
2 Hunt/eat/drink
3 Run top speed at/from
4 Poop/pee/vomit on
5 Scratch
6 Meow at
7 Doze atop
8 Climb up
9 Rub face on
10 Make pastry on

Need (d6):
1 Ownership
2 Relief
3 Vantage
4 Comfort
5 Warmth
6 Food
(If d6 result equals d10 result, Need is DEMONS!)

Each scene:
-GM narrates scene from perspective of human owner
-Every player cat acts:
1. picking Noun in scene
2. rolling Action and Need
3. describing why (in their cat mind) they Action Noun because Need
-Solo player cat acts twice
-GM reacts way human owner would, trying to clean up after cats but distracted by cuteness
-GM gains 1 stress for every 1 Noun they have to clean/fix
-GM can remove 1 stress by successfully stroking a cat
-Stroked cats immediately act again, as above
-Check stress

End:
A) Stress>2n - house ruined - cats win
B) Stress<n for 3 consecutive scenes - cuddles - everyone wins!
