```
In TTOS, players exist in a bugged, digital landscape on the brink of collapse. Their greatest tool is Heartbreaking: the act of straining the data they are composed of to warp their virtual reality.

Each character has six Aspects of their uploaded consciousness: three Passions of the character, two Frailties such as fears or vices, and their Core motivation.
 
When attempting a task, roll 1d6, succeeding on 5+. You may also Heartbreak, risking your stability to warp the simulation around you. You gain additional dice depending on the type of Aspect you risk: +1d6 from Passions, +2d6 from Frailties, +3d6 from your Core. You succeed so long as you roll one 5 or 6.

If a 1 is rolled while Heartbreaking, that Aspect is lost, severed from your character's personality and manifesting physically in the scene. If a character has three or less Aspects, their existence is worn thin, succeeding on 6s only. If a character loses all Aspects, the GM takes control of them as they become data-starved monstrosities called Husks.

Any player near a loose Aspect can roll 1d6. On a 3+, they integrate the Aspect into themselves, otherwise it is destroyed.
