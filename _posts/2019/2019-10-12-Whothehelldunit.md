For 4+ players.

~~~~~~~~~

You're invited to a party, but the host is nowhere to be seen. A blood-curdling scream rings out, and you all rush over to find the corpse of the host in this very room. Their death seems recent, meaning the killer is someone in this building, hidden among you.....

~~~~~~~~~

Players choose 1 person to be the ghost of the victim.

Come up with your character's backstory (who's the victim to you, do you know other characters, what's your job, etc.)

Ghost of the victim tells players how they died (bludgeoning, stabbing, poisoning, etc.)

Living players flip a coin secretly to determine if they're innocent (heads) or guilty (tails). Only the ghost sees the results.

~~~~~~~~~

Players look around the room, using objects or items around other players to accuse them of the murder. Everyone makes accusations, then votes who to accuse, and the ghost kills the accused. If there are still killers alive, the ghost gives a vague hint about the killer (perhaps in how they killed the accused), and the process repeats.

The game ends when all the killers are killed, and the ghost is at peace, or all innocents are killed, and the killers get away.
