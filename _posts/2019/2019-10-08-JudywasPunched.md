You are fleeing Punch, the most terrible puppet of all, trying to find a better life away from him.

He has taken your words away.
You can grunt, mime, gesture and babble but not say any words. You will mainly communicate using your hands and hope you are understood.

When you want to attempt a difficult action, play rock paper scissors with the GM.
If you win, you succeed.
If you fail, you suffer a setback.
If you draw, ask "the audience" a question like "Where is he?" or "What did he do to our baby?". This is the only time a player can speak. The GM answers.

To escape Punch, you need to make friends along the way.

GM: Pick 3 characters from this list. Each one will help the player a little bit but may ask for something in return. 
The Policeman
The Crocodile
The Devil
The Doctor
The Executioner
The Clown 

Once the player has been helped by the three characters, they have their words back and the freedom to exit into the audience. Or they can choose to stay and battle Punch, finally finding the strength to fight back. 

At long last, the choice is theirs.
