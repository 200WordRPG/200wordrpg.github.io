A game for two players: 

God - The Great Author, The Mover Unmoved. What world have you created?

Job - A person, not at ease. They have no rest, but trouble comes. How has God wronged you?


Job briefly lists God's crimes, ending: "I would speak to the Almighty, for I desire to reason with God."

God then describes the terrible form in which They appear to Job - a fire, a whirlwind, a still quiet voice. They command "Who is this that demands counsel, with words without knowledge?"


Then, God and Job play a game of Questions, Job demanding answers, and God presenting mysteries.  Each player may only speak in questions - if they make any other sort of utterance, or are struck speechless, they must flip a coin. Whenever Job flips tails, their resolve to question God is worn down. Whenever God flips tails, their aegis of mystery is eroded, a little bit. If either player gets five tails, they must concede defeat - Job must recant, contented that they are dust, or God must confess the Mysteries of Creation.


After someone concedes, narrate:

God - How do you reward Job?

Job - How do you live out the rest of your days in peace?
```
