```
One player is a dwarf. Write your name and the treasure your people lost which you hope to recover.

All other players are halflings. Write your name and your favorite food, the more elaborate the better (keep it secret).

Going around, the dwarf attempts to persuade a halfling to join their quest by addressing them by name and offering them a specific food. Halflings eat the food, thank the dwarf by name, and comment that it "needs more [ingredient from their favorite food]".

When the dwarf offers a halfling exactly their favorite food, they will agree to be a thief for the dwarf. Both win a share of the treasure.

The other halflings win because they got a bunch of free food, and don't have to go on a perilous adventure far from home.
