I recently retired and started my indie game development studio - Art of Wargames. I'm designing a tactical level hex and counter wargame as well as a Solitaire RPG set in a low fantasy medieval Japan. I'm excited as this is my first submission to any game related contest and quite honestly a bit outside of my wheelhouse. I hope you enjoy the little game.
