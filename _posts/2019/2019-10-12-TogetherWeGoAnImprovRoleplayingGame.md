```
A group of 5-10 people sit in a circle/ around a table. Drawn from a bowl, each player blindly chooses from Roles with a certain Gift;

A King - With Wisdom: a Voice Like a Drum
A Saint - With Faith : Hands that Heal
A Soldier - With Courage : a Rifle for Protection
A Scholar - With Reason: a Book Full of Words
A Shepherd - With Vigilance: a Flock to Guard
A Wizard - With Wit: a Staff of Illusion
A Peasant - With Sympathy: a Tankard of Ale
A Child - With Joy: the Toys of Youth
A Nobel - With Grace: the Coin of their Rank
Death - With Finality: the Scyth of Division

The story, told collectively and improvisationally through the different roles, focuses on a journey to:

Defeat a Great Evil
Find True Love
Break a Terrible Curse

Together players decide the type and, starting with the peasant, proceed clockwise. A player's role isn't revealed until the end of their turn. Items are used as plot elements and to transition between players. The goal is to keep the story going until Death's turn. When Death is reached they summarize and finalize the story, then collect the rolls back into the bowl to be redistributed.

I love games that give room for players to tell their own stories in community.
