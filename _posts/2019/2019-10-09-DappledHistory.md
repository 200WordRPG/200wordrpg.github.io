Gather: a blank map, drawing tools, at least yourself

Whoever last built something goes first.

On your turn choose 1:


- Add something to the map. It can be as small as a pebble or as big as a mountain. It could be a fence post or a fence, a tree or a forest. Just make sure that you leave room for others.

Tell us about the history or significance of what you added. A story, a memory, a fact, a rumour.


(After 2 rounds.)


- Introduce a character. Draw a symbol that represents them near a place they hangout. Tell us what they look like and a little about who they are.


- Add a new hangout for an existing character, with consent from whoever introduced them. Draw their symbol nearby and tell us a story they have of this place, and how they relate to it.


- Ask the group if they want to describe a story two or more characters with nearby symbols share and how they relate to each other. If everyone isn't on board, do something else.



When you run out of room or time, or grow tired or restless, give this place a name together and end play.
