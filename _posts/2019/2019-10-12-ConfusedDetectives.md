A mystery for 3+ players.  You need pens, paper, index cards

You've come together to solve a mystery.  Together determine who/what/where you are (hard boiled gumshoes, a Japanese Attorney and crew, military investigators...).  
After, figure out what crime you are investigating (murder, theft, missing person...).  
Individually, take 6 index cards and fill out the following:
   2x Clue/evidence - Fingerprints, a scrap of paper with something written
   2x Witness - A neighbor
   2X Suspect - An estranged spouse, an angry business partner, a rival
   2x Motive - An upcoming contest, an inheritance

After everyone has filled out their cards shuffle them all together.  

Play begins and one player draws a card and interprets the scene.  Everything they provide about the card is true but not necessarily relevant to the investigation.  Play the scene with the other players asking questions, interrogating, or otherwise exploring the information.  When satisfied, the next player draws a card and they frame the next scene.  Play continues until everyone has had two chances to frame scenes.  After the final card scene the detective team determines how they think the crime occurred, motives, perpetrators.  Did you solve the crime?  What are the results?
