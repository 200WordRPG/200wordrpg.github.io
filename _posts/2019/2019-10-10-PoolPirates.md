```
Requires: 1 body of water, 3 pool noodles in black (Pirate), blue (Navy) & yellow (Merchant)
Collectively decide on 3 locations in the water for ports and 3 players to be captains

Each captain takes a noodle and other players join a crew 
Players may leave ships at any port and then may join any ship that travels to that port

The crew of the Merchant ship gets a point by traveling from one port to another
The crew of the Pirate ship gets a point for battling merchants
The crew of the Navy ship gets two points for winning battles against pirates


Battle
If ships meet at sea the captains will declare why they are the best captain and all players in each ship pick a side.  The captain with the most players on their side gets 3 points.  


Mutiny
If the crew mutinies the captain must swim to a port and a new captain is elected.  If more than half of a crew agrees they can mutiny


End
The game ends when it feels right.  Players with 20+ points win, players with < 20 points wasted their life.
