```
Put away all distractions (e.g. phones) in a bag.
Sit with other players all around the table and put a bowl at the center.

1. Each player writes anonymously a real secret about himself/herself, a confession, or a private thought (in no more than 20 words) on a piece of paper and put it in the bowl. Make sure that everyone uses the same pen color.
2. Shake the bowl.
3. Each player picks up a piece of paper from the bowl and reads it silence. 
4. Then each player pass the piece of paper to the player on the right until every piece of paper is read by everyone.
5. All the players must return all the pieces of paper in the bowl. 
6. One of the players lights up a match and throw it in the bowl, giving fire to the secrets that will vanish forever.

Now you got closer to your friends, you know their secrets. But you won't know who they belong to.
