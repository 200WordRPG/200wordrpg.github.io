You are a second year student at the Bardic College, having learned many of the magical songs of your craft. Like many of your fellows you congregate after class at the Sodden Badger Inn, to practice the ancient art of Song Dueling.

How to Play:

You have to have a way to stream songs upon demand, such as a phone, or Alexa. Pair off with your opponent and begin.

Flip a coin to see who goes first. Whoever is the attacker chooses a song, begins to play it, and spends some time describing the nature of the spell they are casting. When the song is done, the defender gets to cast their counter-song. They too play a song, describing how the spell takes effect. These are all illusions; no direct damage is ever done.

The rest of the players then vote on the winner of the round. The best of three rounds wins.

Example: Jim plays Peace Sells by Megadeath, describing a field of illusionary warriors marching along, etc. Beth, on her turn, plays For Whom the Bell Tolls by Metallica, and describes a scene of Death slaying the soldiers, etc. Everyone votes for Beth. Repeat.
