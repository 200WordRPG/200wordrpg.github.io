For 2+ players.

Gather at night. The Summoning will ease three negative emotions. Decide which emotions to bring with you: hate, greed, pain, sorrow, envy etc. Different players can bring different emotions.

Bring news articles / printouts of social media posts / books / flammable objects that evoke those emotions. These are your sacrifices.

Light an open flame. You will be burning things, so make sure it's safe to do so.

Say this together: "Scavengers and tricksters, accept our offerings. Dine on our scraps and lick our tears."

Go round the circle. Each player holds up a sacrifice and speaks according to this formula:
"Listen, you who [past action]. Behold a [description of sacrifice]. I charge you: [imperative action]."

For example: "Listen, you who forged speech. Behold a man with the best words. I charge you: curse his lies so that he must answer for them."

Burn the sacrifice. Together, say: "Hear our pleas and send us aid."

Move on to the next player. Save your most heartfelt sacrifices for last.

When all sacrifices are burnt, speak together: "Hidden, you swallow our hidden prayers. May your bellies be full and our hearts lighter."

Put out the flame.
