You need:
1d6, pens and paper, 2 Players that will take turns playing Barbarians and the Glorious Destiny (GD).

Define the setting: fantasy, post-apocalyptic or something else. Who are the Barbarians and their worst enemies? What's your quest?
When you are satisfied with the setting you can start playing! 

GD: set scenes by introducing obstacles the Barbarian must overcome to advance or complete the quest. Your role is to describe the location and all the characters that populate it, if the Barbarian is too close to the goal introduce new complications. 
The world should be hostile, harsh and brutal, try to push the Barbarian to make hard choices.

Barbarian: roll the die, it will determine the dominant feeling of the scene.
Feelings can be a motivation, a medium or inspire your objective.

During the scene you play the Barbarian describing their actions, thoughts and words, remember to incorporate the feelings in the narration.
The Barbarian is unstoppable, but can never overcome the obstacle unless they scream, cry or laugh (or something else, as appropriate to their emotions), with a mighty vocalization they will triumph!

Feelings die:
1 Love
2 Hatred
3 Pride
4 Desperation
5 Euphoria
6 Hunger
```
