You are a group of researchers in an isolated base. One of you is a Thing from outer space, hiding in the warm cocoon of a former friend. Draw lots to determine who. Keep your lot a secret.

Separate into pairs, and set a timer for five minutes. In those pairs, play out a scene set somewhere in the base, between yourself and another researcher. What role do you serve in the base? What do you do to relax? Do you know you are a Thing, and do you hunger for something more than your rations, something you cannot understand? 

Switch pairs every five minutes.

When the Thing grows restless, they may assimilate another player by shaking their hand. That player may go on to assimilate more people. If you do not wish to assimilate anyone, you may remain alone.

When any researcher (Thing or not) suspects another of being a Thing, they may shoot them with a finger-gun gesture, and remove that player from the game. The dead are not obligated to reveal if they were a Thing.

The game is over when all researchers are no longer themselves, or when only one survivor remains.
