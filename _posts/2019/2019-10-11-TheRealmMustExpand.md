In this game of three act mini-adventures the players become...

The Realm: Which details how it expands.  
    Be it peaceful or forceful.

The Outside: Where hardships the realm faces appear from.
    Be it nature or creature.

The Heroes: Who describe those rising up to protect the realm.
    Be they urchin or duke.

Starting from the top. When each player has added their ingredient the adventure begins.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Play the acts as vignettes focusing on:

I:  Heroes' origins.

II: Their journey.

III: The resolution.

Provide a description in order of:

The Heroes: How they progress in their quest.
The Outside: An obstacle in their way.
The Realm: Their support of The Heroes.

Act out each scene with heroes of course played by The Heroes, antagonists/nature the Outside and supporting cast The Realm.


Once the adventure is finished The Realm expands once more.

"Wargame"

Draw:

###
#R#
###

Expand as Realm grows.

Assign influence:
# = 1d10+2
R = Pick


Realm spends influence from cells, expanding into others to capture.

Influence is adventure dice pool. Distill each act into one roll. Outside declares difficulty first.

Heroes pick 2 skills for permanent 1d10 bonus to relevant rolls.

Realm collapses at zero influence left.

A realm RPG distilled into the very minimum. A vague realm, its challenges and heroes to save the day.  
The idea to explicitly make the adventures into tiny vignettes. Came from wanting let players see as many facets of their shared realm and world as possible. No dawdling at the inn. But rather brief glimpses of all kinds of heroes and monsters from all over its history.
