A game of strong constitutions, for several players.
 
Together, establish scale:  Nations?  People?  Cats?  Ants?
 
Each describe your own purpose.  A single sentence, perhaps two.  This is your raison d'Ãªtre.  Your "Wherefore".
 
Divide six points between Original Intent, and Flexible Interpretation.
 
Together, describe your relationships, ambitions, and plots.  Make up actions you might take until some action is contentious.

Other players decide if you are acting within the intent of your stated purpose.  If so, roll against the value of your intent.  Otherwise, against Flexibility.  If needed, you act as the tie breaker.

If you roll equal or under, you have the presence and purpose necessary for success.  Good job.
 
If you roll over, you lack the focus, clarity of intent, or will to be successful.  Maybe you didn't try hard enough, prepare enough, or want it enough.

Choose the reason for your failure.  This becomes a defining quality of your character, and colors the way others interact with you.
 
Record any success or failure as precedent.  A majority of the players may cite precedent to declare that you automatically succeed or fail in any similar endeavor you attempt in the future.  If needed, you may be a tie breaker.
