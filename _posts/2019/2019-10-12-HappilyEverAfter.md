Many suitors wait outside the Princess' window.
One of them is her authentic Prince Charming.
One of them is the Princess in disguise!
Game for 3 or more players. 

The goal of the Princess is to find her Prince Charming and vice-versa; Suitors aim to be chosen by the Princess.

At the start of the game, one player writes a "Princess" card, one "Prince Charming", and as many "Suitor" as necessary for the remaining players. These cards are randomly assigned to the players in order to set their secret identities.

Each player takes turns to try to impress the Princess. Each one describes an amazing feat they'd done or would do for the Princess' love. 
Example: "I'd slay every dragon in these lands!".

After each player described at least 2 feats, the Princess reveals her identity and selects a suitor. If she guesses the Prince Charming, they live happily ever after. If she does not, the Suitor then narrates a new end to the story. 
Example: "We moved to my farm to raise chickens!".

The couple formed may exchange phone numbers and become friends.

Winking is allowed throughout the game to signal other players, whichever their role or intentions are.

I hope you play and enjoy my 200 word RPG! Feedback is always appreciated.
Sorry if the pronouns used for the Princess/Prince/Suitor offend anyone. English is not my main language, and this was written with the best of intentions :)
