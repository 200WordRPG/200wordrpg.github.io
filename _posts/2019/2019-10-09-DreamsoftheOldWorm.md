```
You (four): Dreamshapers (sorcerers)
You (one): Rang, the Old Worm (senator)
You (all) need: marker, whiteboard, playing cards (54)
Rang has bad policies but believes in the people's will. He is dreaming (and therefore connected to other dreamers). Dreamshapers will change his dreams.
First turn (Rang): Describe your dream in three sentences. Write the sentences out. Place a card on the table for each significant detail (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, conjunction, preposition) given. Rang plays face-down cards.
First turn (Dreamshapers): Draw three cards from the deck, and flip the table's cards face-up. Every dreamshaper takes a turn placing a card on top of one of the table's cards with the same value or suit. A Joker overwrites anything. Speak of the new detail; how did the dream change?
Other turns (Rang): After all Dreamshapers go, replace a detail by replacing a table card with a face-down card from the deck. Describe what changed.
Other turns (Dreamshapers): Flip the card face-up. Take another round replacing cards and describing changes.
Play continues between Rang and Dreamshapers until Dreamshapers are out of cards. Rang takes the last turn. He wakes up and tells his chamberlain his dream. What is his new plan?

This game is based on a setting I was working on nearly 10 years ago. That setting, a watercolor renaissance Italy, was called Arpraine and featured a country called Arvucia where Rang was a politician. Dreamshaping was a type of magick that involved changing the dreams of those sleeping. It worked more like a hack of Ars Magica in that version, but I think I like this better. Happy dreams to you.
