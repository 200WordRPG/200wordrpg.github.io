```
In this game, three players narrate the rise and fall of a civilisation.

Phase 1 - Creation:

Each player in turn defines one starting characteristic of their initial tribe: physical environment (climate, presence of resources...), origin story (real or mythological) and relation to others (isolated, surrounded by enemies...).


Phase 2 - Rise:

This phase lasts up to 10 rounds, with three roles rotating each round, describing the following:
	1) A major event affecting the whole civilisation (plague, invasion, scientific discovery...)
	2) The immediate reaction and impact from this event by the population
	3) The slow aftermath over the following century, as the civilisation adapts

Each round covers a 100 years in total, and must take into account (and possibly build on) the consequences of all previous rounds. Players are free to discuss the evolution of society and collective psychology in as much depth as they may find interesting.


Phase 3 - Fall:

If the civilisation is still standing at this point, each player then must describe a way in which it brings about its own downfall. All three scenarios then happen at once in an era-ending moment; it is up to the players to decide what legacy if any may be left behind.
