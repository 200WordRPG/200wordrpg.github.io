     Sit. Stay. Speak.

>Where have humans gone? No dog knows. Must find human friends- get good treats, get nice pats.<

Who are these good pups? Furry, curly, short, tall, wrinkly, lanky, brown, white, spotted, merle. Many kinds to meet! Learn each other's smells. What are collar names? What are favorite treat or toy? What was naughtiest flub? Good one!

Wild is rough, encounter many things. Might go through lonely city, spooky woods, long travel, meet other dogs. Might even see cats! Use pup traits to work way out of trouble. 

     Woof - Growl, Beg, Yap. 
     Fight - Dig, Attack, Gnaw.
     Brains - Tricks, Courage, Know-how.
     Speed - Run, Jump, Swim.
     Track - Scent, Hearing, Identify.
     Attention - Follow-through, Awareness, Motivation.


Each pup gets +1 to two traits, +2 to one trait, -2 to one trait. 

Roll traits: (2-6 big oops) (7-9 some good some bad) (10-12 tail waggin time) (13-14 wags +gain a treat)

     Treats- Eat a treat to gain a roll. Give a treat to give a roll. Resources limited, only 5x number of dogs.

>Game ends when find humans, get good good pats.<
