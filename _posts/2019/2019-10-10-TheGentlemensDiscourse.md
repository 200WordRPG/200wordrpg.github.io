Each player takes two red tokens and three blue tokens. 

Starting with the oldest player, they will choose another player to challenge to a battle of "wits." 

The Challenger is trying to defame the Defender, who is trying to protect his honor. 

The Challenger starts by making an outlandish and scandalous claim; for example, "I saw you at the party coveting the Queen!"

The Defender will try to rebuke that statement by creating an equally outlandish alibi; for example, "I would never! It was a masquerade!" 

The Challenger gets a final chance to try and defame their opponent. "That's how I know it was you, you weren't wearing a mask!

Other players may interject with added details by spending one of their blue coins; for example, "Yes, I remember you drank yourself silly before meeting her."

At the end of the round, the other players will vote on if the challenger or the defender had the most compelling argument. 

Whoever is right wins the other person's token. 

The game ends when only one player remains with red tokens; The Master of Gentlemen Discourse!

Special thanks to my friends and family for always trying out my games. Big thank you to my Grandparents for encouraging my creativity of making board games when I was young.
