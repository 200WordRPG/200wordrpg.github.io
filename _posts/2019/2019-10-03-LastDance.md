A game about music, reminiscence and the end of the world for 3-5 players.
The world is going to end at the climax of this party. As a group, decide why the party is happening, the host and who's attending. Players will be party attendees, the GM runs the world around them. 

Players and GM: create a playlist of 90-150 songs, together. Don't add more than two weird obscure songs only you know, mutual recognition is vital to the game. Three minute pop songs are ideal. 

When a scene starts, the GM describes a situation and shuffles the playlist. The players discuss why, right now, this song matters more to them than anyone else in the world. This can reveal their past, response to the scene or current emotional state.

Anything stated during scene framing by any player remains true. If players don't agree when the song ends, the GM decides who's argument is most relevant. The chosen player chooses how the scene resolves. Other players act as a supporting cast, hindering or assisting that player's resolution. 

After twice as many scenes as players, the world ends, and with it any of the conflicts at the party.
