```
Everyone has a story to tell, or so the saying goes... Then, how come you - a Writer [player one] cannot come up with even a single tale? You've searched your heart, scoured your soul, poked at your mind and there's nothing. So, you shout and curse all of the gods.

As an answer, lightning strikes and your Muses [other players - up to seven of them] are made manifest! Silently, each of them draws up a paper at random, with the following topics.

Setting|	|Characters	|Plot	|Conflict	|Theme	|Point-of-View		|Tone

[The Muses must fill the topics with additional content, for example, the Setting can be post-apocalyptic fantasy, Characters - a sentient snail, the Plot - the suns have died and everyone must find shelter in the underground; etc.]

Thus, your prayers are answered! But the gods made you work for your new masterpiece. You must spin a tale based on the topics and content provided by the Muses. [If there are fewer than seven Muses, you must come up with content!] You have moments to prepare [~5 minutes] and little time [~20 minutes] to tell the tale.

Once done, one of the Muses becomes the Writer and the cycle begins anew.
