```
This is a GM-less RPG about the diverse relationships people have with their bodies.
Before the game begins, answer these questions privately about your character:
Why are you here? Medical reasons? Cosmetic? In between?
How do you feel in your body?
How do you feel about your body?
Do you feel healthy? Beautiful?
What do you most hope for from surgery?
Play begins as characters gather in plastic surgeon's office.
Each player describes their character and what they choose to read while they wait to see the doctor.
When the silence becomes overwhelming, break it.
Use the flow of conversation to answer questions about yourself and others.
Play ends when a player says "oh, that's me." signalling that they have been called out of the waiting room.
