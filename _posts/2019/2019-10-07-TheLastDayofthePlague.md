It is the last day of the plague. Many have died, many more will. You will tell their stories.

Each player names one location in the town, then takes three six-sided dice.

Each player holds up a die, speaks a name. Say what they do, what they are like, one thing this person loves. Then place the die in the center.

Once all of the dice are in the center, roll them.

In the first round, the player who was sick last goes first. After, whoever took the lowest numbered die last round will.

The first player chooses a location, says what is happening there.

The player to their left chooses one person and one of the dice. Continue left, doing the same.

If the die is three or less, the person will die of the plague, a four or five, they will be murdered, a six, a tragic accident will befall them.

Play out a scene with these people meeting. Talk about what they love, talk about their hopes and dreams.

When the scene concludes, each player says how that person dies. Speak their last words.

Continue until all the dice are gone, their final stories all told.
