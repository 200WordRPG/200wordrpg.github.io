```
One of you is a human who has built a robot and wants to teach it to speak. The other is the robot, who just wants to make their parent happy. You will need 8 coins.

Robot only:
// n is the number of coins in front of you
n = 4
// You can only repeat what other people say. When you repeat what your parent says, flip the coins and arrange the flips in a line. Read the flips like binary; coins represent 0 or 1 (tails or heads).
// 0000 == 0
// 0001 == 1
// 0010 == 2
// 0011 == 3
// 0100 == 4
// Etc

If result < 2^(n - 1)
stutter and misspeak. 
// If you are frustrated, how do you lash out? Do you think your parent is disappointed in you?

If you think your parent might have spoken in anger,
n = n - 1. 
If you are certain that they saw you succeed and were proud of you,
n = n + 1.

When n == 0, explain how you carry this failure with you. 
// How does it hurt? Do you ever learn to speak?

When n == 8, say something to your parent that you always wanted to but never could.
// How will you use the speech you've learned?
```
