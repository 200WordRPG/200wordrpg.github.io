Nope. You are a cool Guy form an 80's action-movie protagonist. 
Cool guys don't look at explosions.

Write down these Traits: sunglasses type, wearing style, one-word backstory, catch-phrase.


HOW TO PLAY A SCENE? 
Choose: a Place and One or more Character (reusable). One question.
Decide other details together.

One plays Guy (rotates every scene). 
Others play other characters and call for Conflicts. 
Just call a Conflict by saying, "No, and..". 
Guy can accept or strike one of their Traits to overcome.

Try to answer the scene question, end the scene when you do.
You may pitch more questions for playing more than four scenes.

This game starts on a dare, should be played as a dare, and will definitely end in a dare. I hope you'll have fun!
