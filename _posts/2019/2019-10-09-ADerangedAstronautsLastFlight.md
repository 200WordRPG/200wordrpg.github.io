A GM describes a space ship that is on it's way to doom in the next 30 minutes. Could be a core meltdown or O2-system breaking down.

Each player comes up with 2 bizzare or otherwise difficult to achieve achievements or feats that a soon to be astronaut might want to do before death. Write the feats on paper slips and mix them. Give each player one slip at random.

Players try to achieve the thing described on the paper. For more hilarity, make 2 types of achievements. "Easy" and "Difficult". While Easy might be to "punch another player" the difficult ones might be "Throw another player to jump out of an airlock".

Each player rolls personality at random. 1D6
Even numbers = Negative (narcisstic/sadistic)
Odd numbers = Positive (helpful/cooperative)

Depending on the personality the players might help or hinder the other players plans.

When GM describes obstacles and hardships: Roll 2d6
2-6 = Pure fail
7-10 = Success with a setback
11-12 = Pure success

The ship will be destroyed in 30 minutes. You can use a real time clock or a GM-timed "in game clock" to measure time.
