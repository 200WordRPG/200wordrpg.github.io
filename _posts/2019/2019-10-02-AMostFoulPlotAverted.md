```
Required: 32-card deck, four PLAYERS, GM. Shuffle cards, the Sevens separately as RANDOMIZER.

Scenario: A palace garden, diplomatic party with representatives of four KINGDOMS. 

Suits represent KINGDOMS, faces roles:

King, Queen
Ace = Royal advisor
Jack = General
Ten = Bodyguard
Nine = Handmaid
Eight = Fool

PLAYERS draw their character from the deck.

RANDOMIZER (draw, no replace) determines KINGDOM goals, known only to GM and PLAYERS of that KINGDOM:

Spade: Assassinate VICTIM KINGDOM's leaders (also knows VICTIM).
Clubs: VICTIM - uncover plot, survive.
Hearts: Host - save face.
Diamond: Profit from chaos.

PLAYERS in turns draw NPC (redraw if own KINGDOM), converse up to five minutes, four rounds. RANDOMIZER (draw and replace) determines NPC personality:

Hearts: social.
Diamond: rational.
Spade: competitive.
Clubs: fearful.

Inactive PLAYERS choose NPC looks, meeting situation. GM plays them. Invent facts as needed.

Then hue and cry is raised: "Murder! ASSASSINS!"

Each PLAYER chooses one PC or NPC TARGET they run towards to achieve their KINGDOM's goal. GM shuffles VICTIM and non-TARGET previously drawn NPCs, plus the Sevens as ASSASSINS. PLAYERS take turns drawing first an encounter on the way, then someone they find with TARGET. GM adds characters and decides action results for maximum drama.
