```
A player chooses a tree to claim. They must yell "I SPEAK FOR THIS TREE!" 

Each player must defend why they speak for that tree, they must include in their statement;

What kind of tree it is (you can name any type of tree or make up a name for it).
What this tree wants to say.
How the tree got there. Were they simply planted there? Were they from far away? 

Each player must then declare something the tree needs to continue being successful. 

In order to get the things the tree needs they must ask people around them, who are NOT Lorax's. In order to ask for things they can casually ask them, sing it, scream it at them (in a non-threatening way). If they say no to whatever you request just walk away. If they say yes, then start to persuade them to join you in being a Lorax for your tree. 

If someone willingly approaches you and your tree, the only thing you are allowed to say to them "I AM THE LORAX AND I SPEAK FOR THIS TREE!"

Game is over once it reaches 15 Lorax's. The game must start with at least 3 Lorax's.
