Basic Premise
This game is played with a GM, 2-6 players, and a handful of six-sided dice. Players are citizens of a small town in the middle of nowhere. Establish how they all know each other. Strange things are beginning to happen in town, and they are going to be tangled up in it.

Inciting Incident
1 Murder
2 Disappearance
3 Appearance
4 Sighting
5 Strange Behavior
6 Dreams

Resolving Uncertainty
When a player takes action, and the result is unclear, they roll a die. They can get extra dice in a few ways:

-Possess a significant advantage
-Work together with others
-Trigger a new Oddity

Take the highest die, and interpret the results:
1-3: No, And (Failure, things get worse.)
4: No, But (Failure, a bright side.)
5: Yes, But (Success, with a catch.)
6: Yes, And (Success, things get better.)

Oddities
Endless hallways. Strange creatures in the woods. Creepy strangers on the side of the road. As the players dig up the secrets of their town, reality unravels, and the world becomes more like a dream, or a nightmare. Some are innocuous new neighbors, some are deadly monsters. Oddities are permanent, they will snowball over time.

## Author Comments
A game inspired by Welcome to Nightvale, Itras By, and Twin Peaks. I will most likely create an expanded version with lots of random tables that simply couldnâ€™t fit on this sheet.
