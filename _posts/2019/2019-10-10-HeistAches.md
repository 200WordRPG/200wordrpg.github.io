You're a group of hustlers out to take every penny from a rival's casino.

Create 4 traits describing your character (sexy, brawny, marksman). Write down one useful thing (hacker friend, hidden gun) and keep it secret. When revealed, this Ace in the Hole automatically succeeds one relevant task. Players begin with 5 poker chips and their own deck of cards.

Everyone names one area of the casino with something valuable. GM plans some unknown locations, valuables, and security. Discuss heist plans.

Begin heist. When attempting something, draw a card and play up to five cards. GM draws 1-5 cards, depending on the difficulty, and plays up to five cards. Reveal cards simultaneously. A better poker hand than the GM means success. 

Draw an extra card for each relevant trait. After resolving actions, keep a hand of up to 5 cards. Reshuffle your cards when there are none left to draw, or when you play your entire hand.

If an action fails, lose a chip. If you succeed an action by playing the same number of cards as the GM, gain a chip (maximum of 7). If you lose all your chips, you are caught. They're high stakes, after all.
