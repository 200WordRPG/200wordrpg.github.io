Weekness: 1 carta | Disadvantage: reveal 2 cards keep worst 

2 - The RIP creates situations to be solved by the group . Describing the situation, characters envolved, etc. 
Players explain what they do, and they bet a number (1 -3) of cards (do not reveal) representing thir effort. 
Extra cards can be added (max 2 extra cards):

The RIP chooses one card from his hand to be the situation difficulty. 
The player reveal his hand, if one or more cards are higher then the RIP, is a success. Add a card from RIP deck into yours. If not, is a failure, and RIP tells what happends.
