Eternal damnation isn't that bad, all things considered.

I mean, sure it's unbearably hot outside, but you were given a house with all the amenities you could want, and including air conditioning. What's more, your friends are all here too. In fact, your all having a dinner party tonight.

One or two players will host. It is their task to lead their guests on a tour of their home, serve them dinner, and provide entertainment.

Guests will describe their arrival at the party, engage courteously with the hosts, complimenting their home and food, and make small talk.

All will describe their actions in detail, with emphasis on the logistics of movement and the passing of dishes.

Ah, yes. One last detail: The elephant in the room, as it were. The elephants in every room, to be more literal. Every single room in the house is almost entirely occupied by an elephant, multiple if the room is large enough. Everyone must squeeze and maneuver themselves past the pachyderm to do anything; and, most importantly, never acknowledge them.

If anyone mentions the elephants, be it in or out of character, snap a rubber band against their forehead.

Welcome to hell.
