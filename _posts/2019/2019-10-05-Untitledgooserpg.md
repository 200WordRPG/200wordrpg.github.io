```
As a group, pick a GM (Goose Master) and pick the setting of your untitled goose rpg.
Example settings: village, castle, space station, military base.

The GM should come up with some locations, some humans to antagonise, and some items for the geese to steal. At worst, let the geese decide. They must bring this loot back to their goose hideout.

Players, roll a horrible goose by first choosing an identifying item.
Example items: eyepatch, flat cap, red ribbon, sunglasses, bandana.

Then assign 0-3 once each to the following stats: RUN, DUCK, HONK, PECK.
Your FLAP stat is 2.

When you do a thing, roll d6 against the appropriate stat.
You succeed if the result is equal to or less than this number.

RUN: Move quickly, feats of agility
DUCK: Move stealthily
HONK: Persuade, intimidate, deceive
PECK: Pick up something, enter combat

FLAP: Attempt to fly.
A goose can add their FLAP to any other stat, provided that player is flapping their arms.
Someone else may have to roll their d6 for them.

If a goose does something particularly horrible, the GM can award them a Horrible Point, which can be exchanged for an instant success on any action.

First time taking part in something like this. Thanks to Grant Howitt @gshowitt and his compatriots at RRD for being the catalyst that spurred me to write this ridiculous thing.
