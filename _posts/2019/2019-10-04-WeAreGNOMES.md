Your endless ingenuity and creative prowess threaten the Emperor. Rounded up and imprisoned, your people work away your days in forced labour. In 4 days, you escape together.

Build the prison, roll 2d6, each result eliminates a feature: 1-Magical Locks, 2-Underwater, 3-Underground, 4-Beasts, 5-Unblinking Guards, 6-Turrets.

Each day, Build or Aid towards a component for The Contraption. Each component foils a prison feature. To Build, Roll 2d6. DC 5+ succeeds. If successful, roll an additional d6 to conceal your work. If die share a value with either of the Build die cast, you conceal the ruse, and the component is built. If doubles are rolled you are discovered: increase Build DC +1, you may only Build until the escape. To Aid another, you may reroll any one die cast by a player who builds. Only one player may Aid per Build.
Each day sees the total for a success increase by 1. If a component seems outlandish (and it should), Increase Build DC +1, roll 2d6 to conceal. Dumb guards won't see it coming.

On the 5th day, you make your escape, describe how The Contraption undermines the prison features.
