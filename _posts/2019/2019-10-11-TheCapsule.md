In which we roleplay recollections then replay other characters' differing memories!  


Setup:

Each player puts 3 mementos in a bag/time-capsule. 

Random things at-hand are great. 

We're together again. Time to exhume the capsule!  

Discuss these questions:

What brought us together then?  Now?  
Why did we bury it?  

Describe your character....  

Each player makes one notecard for each other player (completing ALL-CAPITALIZED as below).  These will guide other's roleplay by telling them how they're remembered by you. 



(REMEMBERING CHARACTERS NAME)'s  TAKE ON  (YOUR CHARACTER)

I AM:  (DESCRIPTION OF HOW YOU'RE SEEN BY THE REMEMBERER)

BECAUSE: (rememberer will describe a situation) 

YES-AND:  (ADD SOMETHING...)



Vary people's take on you. 
Connect to what's established.  

Pass out cards for "Because:" input.  

Re-collect and complete.

Redistribute so each player has a card-set describing their biases toward each other character


Play:

Take turns pulling a memento out.

Use it to frame a scene (recollecting in character). Lean into your biases. 

Rememberer hands out their cards to respective player/characters. Everyone shares information then plays accordingly!

 "Rememberer" calls scene and re-collects cards. 

Each scene elicits replays:   

Another character disagrees, describes changes (in character) and hands out their cards... 

Reenact!!!

No telling where the "truth lies";).

It has been really rewarding whittling this idea down to a scrimshawed toothpick of a game.  I hope at least a few of you will try it out!   If you do please email me to let me know how it went:  tsbrez@gmail.com.  To quote my beloved grandpa, ‚ÄúHistory has the damndest time repeating itself‚Äù. This was one of the  many memorable quips he would offer up during the inevitably disagreeing reminiscences arising at our family gatherings...  although others may remember the quote differentlyüòÄ.
