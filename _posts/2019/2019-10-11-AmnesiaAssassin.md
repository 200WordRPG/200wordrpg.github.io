```
Pick who the assassin will be this round and have them go out of the room. Establish where you are, what jobs you have, who is the boss, and what you are doing. Decide a certain obscure action for the assassin to do to prove their an assassin, this will come into play. Start pantomiming typical actions that would occur at this location and job. Have the assassin come back in. They have to assimilate with the group, blend in with their surroundings, and get the feel of the place. They have been sent to kill the leader of this group, but have lost their memory. Without being suspicious, they have to ask questions and figure out what's happening, then identify who the boss is and kill them by saying their full title. Ex. "I assassinate you, the judge!" The other players try to win by getting the assassin to do the predetermined obscure action the group agreed upon, and therefore blowing the killer's cover.
