```
Gather some rumormongers around a table or a front porch with somethin' cold to drink and time to kill.

Y'all are a group of busybodies in the dusty town of Dewarhille. A Stranger has ridden into town of a hot, lazy afternoon, and with nothin' better to do you folk have started in to talkin' as folk are known to do. Share your knowledge of this Stranger and set straight who they are and just what it is they're doin' here.

-Someone ought to start. Favor an eavesdropper who's rarin' to go with some juicy tidbit they picked up at the post office or what have you.
-Start every statement of fact about this Stranger with "Well, I heard..." and then elucidate your companions with the tale you learned and where and from whom you learned it.
-Focus on figurin' out: what they look like; where they came from; why they're here; who knows 'em; what they've been seen doin'; who they've been talkin' with
-By the time you've settled the matter amongst yourselves, the Stranger seems to have moved on and y'all are due to be gettin' home for the day anyway. Them chores won't do themselves.
