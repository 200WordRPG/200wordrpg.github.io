It is OPENING NIGHT.

The show is a disaster. Your job is to save it.

There are 2-4 DESIGNERS and a STAGE MANAGER (SM). The SM facilitates the game. Each DESIGNER starts with 1 TIELINE.

The DESIGNERS are the: Lighting DESIGNER, Sound DESIGNER, Set DESIGNER, Costume DESIGNER.

Each DESIGNER selects a quirk and then reveals simultaneously. If a quirk is shared, DESIGNERS are (rivals/dating).
     1. Neon hair
     2. Colored clothes
     3. Heavy accent
     4. Band shirt
     5. Coffee drinker
     6. Former actor

Decide the show together. Mockery is encouraged. 
     1. Shakespeare
     2. Musical
     3. Community Theatre
     4. Off-off-Broadway
     5. One-person show
     6. Greek tragedy

The SM (with suggestions from DESIGNERS) narrates the the show. 4+ things go wrong.

When you try to fix something the actors messed up, roll 2d6+TIELINE.

     * On a 10+, it works better than the original. Gain one TIELINE. 
     * On a 7-9, it works, but there's a problem. The SM offers you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.
     * On a 6-, it gets a lot worse.

After curtain call, all DESIGNERS vent, and then read the reviews. 

The DESIGNER with most TIELINE is mentioned. The rest are not.
