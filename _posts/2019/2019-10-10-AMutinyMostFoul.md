The Captain is dead, and one of you will be forever branded.

Write the following numbers and motives on index cards, and deal one to each player: 1-love, 2-duty, 3-cowardice, 4-greed, 5-cruelty, 6-hunger. These may be attributed to either your character or the captain; either way, it has created an intolerable situation. Repeat with the following: 1-hate, 2-treachery, 3-bravery, 4-fear, 5-justice, 6-compassion. These represent a trait of your character. Together, these reveal who your character is, and why they were willing to mutiny. If both numbers are the same, however, you must secretly remain loyal to your captain!

Players now take turns describing the situation that led to the mutiny. Reveal a card to determine who narrates first; a player with a 1 on either card goes first, followed by any 2, etc. No player may narrate a second scene until everyone has taken a turn. Once each player has taken a turn describing the situation, repeat with your other card to describe how the mutiny occurred.

If there is conflict, the numbers will determine the number of sailors who will fight with you. The higher total wins.
