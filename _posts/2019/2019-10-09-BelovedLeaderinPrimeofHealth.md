Best played with 12+ and extravagant bootlicking.
Beloved Leader is NOT dying!  Talk of a succession crisis is TREASON!

ASSIGN ROLES:
  Beloved Leader
  Chancellor*	\
  Army*	 	 } *senior ministers
  SecPol* 	/
All others are lesser ministers who choose their titles.  Ministers receive three support tokens, which they can freely give any minister.

ACTIONS:
At any time...
  * Beloved Leader may execute anyone.
  * Beloved Leader may designate a senior minister Heir Apparent; only execution removes the designation.  
  * A senior minister may declare a coup.  Spend all tokens; objectors must expend that many together.  If they can't, or can't agree who pays what, the coup succeeds.  Otherwise, coup fails, and usurper is executed.
  * A senior minister may execute any minister for three tokens.

RESOLVE ACTIONS IMMEDIATELY!  Actions may not interrupt others, though unexecuted ministers may share tokens before resolution.  Beloved Leader replaces executed senior ministers from lesser ministers.

Upon a successful coup, Beloved Leader dies.  Successor executes half (round down) the remaining ministers and fills senior positions from survivors.  If any senior ministries remain empty, regime falls.

AFTERMATH:
Successor wins.
Everyone else loses if regime falls.
Anyone loses if executed.
Beloved Leader wins if Heir Apparent succeeds AND regime stands.
Others win if promoted.

## Author Comments
Largely inspired by GCPGrey's "Rules for Rulers," movie "Death of Stalin," and Liulevicius's lectures "Terror and Utopia in the 20th Century."

Roles may readily be reskinned: mafiosi, academics, shareholders... and execution becomes "early retirement," or "spending more time with the family."
