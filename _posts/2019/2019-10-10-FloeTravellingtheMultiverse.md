```
Suddenly, the Portal closes behind you. Your group of Shifters is stranded on the world of Awal that is vanishing into non-existence.
 
Can you find the Key to escape this looming doom?
 
First, describe the Shifters.
Every Player contributes two words or short sentences as character-defining Descriptors and one name. Distribute these evenly amongst you all. 

Second, describe your party. 
Together, write down three group-defining Descriptors.

Third, describe the world. 
Together, write down six Descriptors of what is left.

Descriptors are at stake in challenges of relevance to the story:
One success is needed for a relevant deed,
Two for an important deed,
Three for a truly pivotal deed widely recognized as heroic.
Throw one dice per applicable Descriptor. Even numbers count as successes.
 
If you fail, for each success you needed but did not get, any one Descriptor is lost forever (decide narratively).
For each successful pivotal deed, a new Descriptor is created.
 
To begin, the Narrator tells a legend of this realm.

To end the session, the Players tell a legend of what will be remembered.
 
To venture on, give the next world a name and one fewer Descriptor. How far can you go before you perish tragically?

I wanted to present a rpg that is as comprehensive as possible. World building, character generation, party generation, conflict resolution, campaing rules... just everything you would expect from a typical core book.
My inspiration was a strange mixture  of Kris Burm's great game ZÃˆRTZ and the Episode "The Mysterious Stranger" of the "Adventures of Mark Twain" tv series with a few elements of the MTG fluff thrown in. Sometimes, strange things align... 
My best advise for all players and Narrators: feel free to interpret everything the way you like and JUST HAVE FUN!
