```
Name your mice and your clan, and choose tokens.
Roll 5d6 per player onto any sheet of paper, spread out clusters, and pencil each result beneath its die. Remove dice and draw boundaries between. 

1 Safe path
2 Perilous path, 1 extra ENERGY to avoid dangers
3 Food Source, gain 2 ENERGY 
4 Water, gain 1 ENERGY
5 Shelter, end day here to gain 1 ENERGY 
6 Impassable human development

Begin anywhere with 8 ENERGY. Number days starting at 1. Days end when all mice are in shelter.
Moving costs 1 ENERGY. Food spaces can't be shared, or gathered two days in a row. Shelter is 1 ENERGY more effective if shared, but fouls if used three nights running or if a mouse stays in all day.
Name each area when first encountered - think mouse thoughts.
On days ending in 5, reroll 1s and 2s, replacing number in matching area with new result.
On days ending in 9, reroll 4s and HALF of 6s.
On days ending in 0, reroll 3s and 5s. Foul Shelters clear.
When first revisiting changed areas, rename them.
Game ends on starvation (0 ENERGY), sorrow, or bounteous resources.
