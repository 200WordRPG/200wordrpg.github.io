With the tyrant vanquished, the people can rebuild, but years of conflict have reduced the kingdom to ruin.

Pick a profession. You are commonfolk, not adventurers - blacksmiths, farmers, shopkeepers. You have a shared pool of resources, one per player.

Each player writes down a problem: widespread famine, flooded farmland, rampant crime, etc. Shuffle them and, without looking, write ascending numbers on their backs starting with 1. This is each problem's severity.

Flip over any one of the problems. Roll the die and add the severity; this is the difficulty to solve the problem.

All players roll. If one of the players has a relevant skill they want to use, add +1 to their roll. That player becomes exhausted and cannot roll for the next problem. Each player that rolls a 1 adds 1 to the group's resource pool.

Compare the highest roll to the difficulty; if it's higher, the problem is solved. If it's lower, the group can choose to spend resources to reach the difficulty, solving it.

You win the game if the total severity of the problems you solved is greater than those left unsolved.

If you fail, the dragon returns.
