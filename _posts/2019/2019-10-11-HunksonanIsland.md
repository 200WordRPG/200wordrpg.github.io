```
One Beauty is on an island with 3+ Hunks. Each Hunk is trying to win the Beauty's Love by the end of the Night. But some Hunks are here for the Wrong Reasons as well...

A Producer distributes between the Hunks an equal number of secret Real and Fraud designations. 

The Beauty wants to find True Love.

Real Hunks want True Love. Fraud Hunks just want to Win.

The Producer wants to create delicious Drama and Conflict between Hunks.

Play out Dinners between the Beauty and all the Hunks, and individual Dates with the Beauty. Producers provide beverages and influence Hunks toward Conflict by asking questions and setting up scenarios.

A Hunk can call out any other Hunk once. The Hunk called out must try to prove their True Love for the Beauty. 

The Beauty should consider defenses when making their final decision. At the end of the Night, the Beauty will give their Love to the Hunk of their choosing. Producers reveal whether that Hunk was Real or a Fraud.

If the Hunk was Real, the Beauty and the Hunk win, and all other Hunks lose.

If the Hunk was a Fraud, Fraud Hunks win.

The Producer always wins.

The Beauty and the Hunks are not restricted by gender identity - Everyone is Beautiful, and Hunkiness is all about presentation. 

Thanks to Melanie for introducing me to Bachelor in Paradise, and incepting the secret role element into my thoughts.
