materials: a tarot deck

-------
-setup-
-------

collectively choose a setting.
deal out the minor arcana.
make a deck of the major arcana (in order).

everyone plays a card, describing their character and allegiance.
[cups: emotion; swords: reason; wands: creativity; pentacles: wealth]
note your allies.

if multiple cards have the same value, discard them and any others of that value.
players who played uniquely take all four cards of that value.

based on cards played/lost, establish your characters/relationships.

whoever played the highest-value unique card leads. [aces are high-value]

------
-play-
------

the leader reveals the next major arcanum, and describes the challenge it represents.
they play a card representing their leadership.

everyone else chooses a card, then simultaneously either:
- reveals it
- takes it back
- gives it to someone else

if the total of the numbers played equals the major arcanum's number, you succeed - if they differ by 1 or 2, you succeed partially.
[court cards have no number, aces are 1]

whoever played the highest-value card following suit places the major arcanum before them, discarding the other cards. 
they become the leader, and describe how the challenge resolved.

------------
-conclusion-
------------

after 22 rounds, note where the cards ended up. 
how have you changed?

Inspired by Friends at the Table (esp. The Tower and the 2016 christmas special) and dark souls 3, I wanted something that had failure baked into the game, used tarot cards, and mixed competitive and cooperative elements, while telling a story. I think it worked! But first draft was 300 words and i think it deserves an expansion... Will do that perhaps soon.
