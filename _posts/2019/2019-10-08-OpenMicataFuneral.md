A terrible game for 5+ people.
 
You are at the funeral for someone you barely knew. You were not personally invited, but it was an open invitation. Those who were officially asked to speak have said their words, and now it's time for the open mic. A facilitator must tally points and keep time to ensure everyone speaks for five long, uncomfortable minutes.
 
Speakers gain five points per each of the following:
·      Make a statement about how you don't want to take up too much time.
·      Sneak in an admission about how little you interacted with the deceased.
·      Incorporate an object into your speech. Ex: a paperclip the deceased once loaned you.
·      Tell an inappropriate story about the deceased.
·      Tell an utterly boring story about an interaction with the deceased.
·      Make an impossibly grand statement about how much the deceased meant to you.
·      Fake cry.
·      Humble-brag.
·      Incorporate an impromptu performance about the deceased that you are ill-prepared for.
·      Claim you share something with the deceased that nobody else does.
 
Players may refer to the list. The game is over once everyone has had a turn to speak. Whoever has the most points wins.
