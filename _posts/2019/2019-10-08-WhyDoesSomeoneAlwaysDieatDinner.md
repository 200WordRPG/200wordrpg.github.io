```
All Players play a character at a dinner party where someone is murdered.  Over the course of the night they must learn about each other, hunt for clues, and find out who's the murderer by rolling the dice and telling a cooperative story in phases.  This is a role-play and story-telling centric game.
Phase 1: The Introduction:
Each player rolls a d6.  The number indicates the number of pieces of personal information about their character they must include in the conversation as the party-goers meet each other.  
Phase 2: The Murder:
The players find the body and search for clues to what happened.  Each player rolls a d6.  The number determines how many clues each player adds to the story.  Players bring forward their clues to the group in character.
Phase 3: The Intrigue:
Each player rolls a d6.  The number rolled determines how many additions or rebuttals they are allowed to make related to the clues found in phase 2.
Phase 4: The Parlor:
All players act out the parlor scene to decide who the murderer is based on the clues, information, and rebuttals brought forward in the first 3 phases.  Dramatic finger pointing and gasping is encouraged.
