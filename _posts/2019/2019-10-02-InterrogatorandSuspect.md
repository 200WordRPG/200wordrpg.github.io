```
"She did it. I'm sure. Her alibi stinks and she's always trying to dodge the important questions. But if she loses concentration for just a moment and says that ONE word, I've GOT her!"

2-5 players.

Two players play the Interrogator and the Suspect for two minutes.

Write a one word crime on a piece of paper, seen by everyone. The Suspect is forbidden to speak this word. If she does she has been exposed by the clever Interrogator and goes to jail.

The Interrogator asks where the Suspect was yesterday and further leading questions. The Suspect tells him her alibi. When two minutes has ended you change who's playing Interrogator and Suspect randomly. The new Interrogator writes down a word that the Suspect was saying under the interrogation (not like he, she, it, I, we etc.). The new Suspect now has to avoid telling the TWO forbidden words and continues to stick to the established alibi. This proceeds until the Suspect is in jail.

If the Suspect is hesitating frequently, being quiet or speaking nonsense the Interrogator may write an extra personal forbidden word for that player. If this is repeated frequently that player is going to jail.
