## Author Comments
This is about creating the feeling of having too many responsibilities and always having someone better around. In this game, Sidekicks run the show but don't get the credit they deserve. The point of the game is to illustrate what it feels like to be this kind of person in the world and highlight how we cannot get along without these unsung heroes.
