```
Needed:
-------
    * 2 people: one referee and one operative.
    * Stopwatch
    * Deck of cards
    * Pool of 15d20


Setup:
------
* The operative rolls 2d20. One result will be the operative's SHOOT stat and one the 
  operative's SEDUCE stat. 


Play:
------
* Tell a story together about a gunfight the operative is in.

* At anytime the referee chooses, the referee shows a card to the operative and starts 
  the stopwatch.

* After seeing the card, the operative chooses to SHOOT or SEDUCE.

* Upon hearing operatives selection, the referee stops the watch.

* The operative can roll any number of d20 in the pool in an attempt to roll higher 
  than the first two millisecond digits on the stopwatch plus the number of full seconds 
  multiplied by 100. The operative can add the stat of their chosen action if they wish.
    
* Success means the operative decides what happens next in the story. Failure means the 
  referee does.
    
* The used die are discarded.
    
* If a face card was turned up, then the operative sees an unarmed civilian that 
  replenishes the dice pool if successfully SEDUCED.

* If a number card, then the operative sees a bad guy that should be SHOT.

For my very first RPG, I thought I would try a type of game totally unlike TTRPGs: First Person Shooters. Crazy huh?
Big thanks to my gf for being supportive, and my job for being boring enough that I think about games I want to create when I should be working. Also thanks to the podcast "Head to Table" for inspiring me to make silly games.
