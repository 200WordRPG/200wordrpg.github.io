Blood-thirsty Outlaws are terrorizing our peacefull Galaxy! Such reckless times require equally hot-headed heroes!

There is one Captain, who tells the story. Other players play as Cowboys - beautifully crazed bandit hunters. To create a Cowboy player should choose Badassness ("Drunken Monk", "Sexy Pilot", "Bold Grunt" or come up with their) and randomly receive Hidden Agenda ("Make love with...", "Vendetta on...", "Trick...", "Destroy..." - the target for Agenda could be a party member, Outlaw or even some special object). They also describe their Ships with one Style- "Speeder", "Stomper", "Trapper" etc.

The Captain describes an Outlaw with 3 Cunnings such as "Bug Collector", "Giant Mothership", "Smokes Poison", "etc. And of course one Edgy Plot - "Rob a Strip Planet", "Kill President of the Galaxy" etc.

Cowboys need to capture Outlaw, but each of them has to secretly fullfill their Agenda.

When Cowboy should overcome Danger, they roll 2d6. If they can use their Badassnes, they get to reroll one die. 1-4 counts as Very Bad, 5-9 as Goes Partly As Planned, 10-12 as Badass!

Outlaw is roleplayed accordingly to his Cunnings (define character and give benefits that Captain thinks are necessary) and Edgy Plot.
