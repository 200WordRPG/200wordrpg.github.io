```
We are all children, but strangers; trapped together, facing an impending doom. Not all will survive.

For 2-5 players.

Setup a Jenga Tower in the middle of the play space.

Everyone takes a cue card and writes: 

Name:
Age:
Hopes:
Dreams:

Write nothing else for now.

This is your character; you are trapped with the others, you are not an adult.

A player goes first and asks to the left, "What do you want to be, if you grow up?" Everyone takes a turn asking to the left until all have answered.

Now go around again, each player taking a turn asking any question they wish to the left.  After they answer, the questioner pulls and places a brick from the tower.  Fill in your own character as you answer.

Keep going around, asking questions, until the tower falls.  

When it falls, everyone's character, except for the last player to have placed a brick, dies.

The survivor answers this question: "Whose dreams will you take with you into the future?"

Use the survivor to create a character in another game and strive to make that world better.

The Beginning.
