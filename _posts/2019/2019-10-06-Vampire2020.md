2020. Smartphones track everything. Vampire hunters are hackers tracing IP addresses. Your community is in disarray. Even the shadows aren't safe. 

You're a vampire. 
Pick a name. From anywhere.
Pick an age. From yesterday to 1000 years.
Pick a fashion. Antiquated, Simple, Trendy, Unkempt.

Roll d10 for:

Diplomacy		Subterfuge		Violence		Magic

Roll d10 at or under attribute to succeed.

Façade starts at 10. Following subtract from Facade:

Burner Phone 
Driver's license
Internet 
Paid work
Smartphone

Legit subtracts 2. Shady subtracts 1. 
A smartphone subtracts double.
If seen, roll d10 at or under Façade to remain in shadows. Otherwise, add 1 Mark.

At 1 Mark, the hunters know your alias.
At 2 Marks, they know your feeding grounds.
At 3 Marks, they know your address. Run, now.

GM roll d10 for scenarios:
1: A gnawing hunger arises.
2: A large event arrives. More blood, more security.
3: An old debt is called in.
4: Hunters found your friend.
5: Someone called the cops.
6: Someone found silvered weapons.
7: You find a hunter's address.
8: You're caught in a crossfire.
9: You're smitten for a mortal.
10: Werewolves are in your turf.

I saw the new Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines game preview, and I thought I would do a more ""accurate"" approach to modern vampires.
