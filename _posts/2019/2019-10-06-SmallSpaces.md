How to play 

Each player takes two notecards and writes a complication word on one and an emotional word on the other. These words are the themes for each scene. Place the cards in the middle of the group and have someone start by pulling a card. They're the narrator for this scene as it will be from their point of view. They must use the word on the card to come up with and act out an event that happens during the first week living as a group. The scene can be just them or whoever they want to be in it with them. There is no limit on how many people are in a scene. Each pull from the deck is a new week, then on the second round a new month until you end on the last card.
