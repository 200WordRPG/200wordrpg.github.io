"There are only bodies and languages, but there are also truths." --Alain Badiou

This is a game of microhistoriography. It is concerned with the emergence of complex and compromised subjectivities in times of crisis and revolution. 

To begin, describe the situation. For simplicity, limit your description to the following four conditions: science, art, politics, love. Provide as little or as much detail for each as you feel is necessary. 

Pick one condition to experience a rupture. A rupture is the event of a truth appearing in the situation. A truth is that which transforms the terms of the situation. 

This transformation occurs in four distinct stages: nomination, intervention, fidelity, forcing. This is the truth-procedure, the process by which bodies are made into subjects.

Nomination (the event is named). How does language change?

Intervention (the event is elaborated). How is life impacted?

Fidelity (the event is solidified). How do you orient yourself toward it?

Forcing (the situation expands according to the event). How do you find your place?

When the truth-procedure is finished, discuss how it will be remembered in five years, fifty years, five hundred years. 

All this is an experiment in the eternal.
