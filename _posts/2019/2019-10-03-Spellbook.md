Spellbook!
by The High Minded


In this game, players play wizards trying to impress the High Wizard with their spellbooks. One player is the High Wizard, judge of the spellbooks. The High Wizard also makes copies of spells, usually simple combinations of symbols and text, and puts them around the game environment before the game. These can be printed on paper or actually part of the environment, such as written on a wall in chalk. Spells can also be given out by other NPCs, if you have enough players, who may require a task to earn a spell. The other players are wizards who wander the environment, collecting spells to scribe into their spellbooks. These books should be blank journal type books brought by players or provided as part of the game. There is also a place for the wizards to scribe the spells into their books using markers and other art supplies to embellish them. At a certain time, all the wizards must turn their spellbook in to be judged. The High Wizard looks over the entries and selects the spellbook which shows the most magical promise! There should be a celebration following the contest!
