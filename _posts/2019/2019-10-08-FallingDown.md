You are a middle-aged man or woman frustrated with your work and passing by a very difficult problem. And the last bad thing that happens to you will be the last straw, making you lose control.

Choose a profession, a personal problem and something that irritates you a lot.

Your rage die starts at 1. Whenever you perform an action, roll 2d6 and add the value of your rage die: 1-6 you fail; 7-9 you get success at a cost; 10-12 you get a success.

Whenever you encounter a situation that irritates you, roll 1d6. If the result is greater than the current number of your rage die, add 1 to your rage die. If it's something related to your profession, personal problem, or what irritates you a lot, add 2 to the rage die instead. When you reach 6, you lose control and commit unbridled violence.

Your police-chased die starts at 1. Whenever you do something violent, roll 1d6. If the result is greater than the current value of your police-chased die, add 1 to it. When you reach 6, the police find you and you are captured.
