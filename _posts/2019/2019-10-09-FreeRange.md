Greetings, fellow Fumoggulians! We hope you had a great time coming out of stasis. Our next destination, Earth, has just been reached. As on previous planets, we will equip you with the necessary morphological changes. Two arms, what a hoot! Remember, eyes are tricky, so please don't forget to put on your shades.

Our group will be shuttled to a large trade building, where the Earthlings purchase their goods. Each traveller will be provided with a special Earth device, a primitive mobile computing unit, that can also make sensory recording. Don't hesitate to use them, it's fun! Please also be reminded of our policy to not directly engage with lifeforms beyond small talk. When approached, we recommend showing your "teeth" in the upper frontal orifice a bit and using one of the following sentences provided by the installed xenotranslator: 

"Hey, nice!" 
"Cool day?"
"Wow..."
"That's great."

After a set period of 30 Earth minutes we will meet again in front of the trade building, where a camouflaged shuttle will pick us up. We will finish the trip by sharing our recordings and voting for the most hilarious one. The winner gets an Earthling hat!
