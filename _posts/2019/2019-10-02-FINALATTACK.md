You are COLORFUL HEROES piloting a MACHINE OF INCREDIBLE POWER. Over the course of many trials and tribulations, your battle against the EMPEROR OF DARKNESS has come down to this: the FINAL ATTACK.

Establish your team and your own hero. What binds you together? Which hero understands your sacrifices?

Consider the Emperor of Darkness. What is their plan? What challenges have you overcome? What sacrifices have been demanded of your team?

Consider the location this showdown occurs in. What threatens you? What must you protect?

As the situation surrounding the final attack becomes evident, it is time to muster your energies. Your attack begins with a number of d6 in the pool equal to the number of players. Consider elements that make the situation more or less desperate, generated in the questions above. For each positive, add a d6. For each negative, remove one.

When you launch the attack, roll the pool. Based on the highest result achieved, narrate your epilogue:

Multiple Sixes: Total victory. What does tomorrow bring?
Six: Victory. How has the battle changed you?
Four-Five: Sacrifice. What does victory cost?
Two-Three: Retreat. What more do you need to win?
One: Defeat. What hope do you leave behind?
