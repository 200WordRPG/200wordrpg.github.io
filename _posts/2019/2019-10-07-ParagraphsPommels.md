The GM is known as the Hero, and the PCs are known as the Weapons. The Hero can only bring one Weapon into the dungeon.

Before you begin coercing the Hero, each Weapon must roll a D6 to determine how much time they have to convince why they should be used. Each Weapon rolls and multiplies the result by 10. This gives them a time limit in seconds. 

After you have selected which Weapon you are, you must convince the Hero why you should be chosen. Each Weapon has a restriction, and a number of seconds on the clock. If you mess up, keep going! After everyone has gone, the Hero chooses who to take. They win! 

Weapons

Sword: Communicate only through gestures. 

Warhammer: Make intense eye contact, unblinking. 

Bow: Speak from outside the room or very far away.

Mace: Only speak in verbs. 

Dagger: Whisper very quietly. 

Spellbook: Spell out every single word. 

Axe: Shout everything in one breath. 

Nunchuck: Repeat every word twice. 

Rapier: Only speak in Adjectives.

Shield: Speak very defensively. 

Spiked Boots: Kick the air with every word. 

Ancient Weapon: Speak in an imaginary language.
