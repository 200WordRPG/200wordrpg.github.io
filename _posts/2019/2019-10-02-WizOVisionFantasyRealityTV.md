"Welcome to Wiz-O-Vision, the hottest fantasy-reality entertainment to hit your local tavern! 
We wizards are giving YOU front row seats to watch, from the comfort of your barstools, as brave heroes face the deadliest dungeons!"
 
In this GMless RPG, players play as apprentices filming actual heroes using magic crystals. 
The goal is to capture as much drama as you can to get the highest ratings!
 
SCENES:
Take turns filming your scenes.
On your turn, choose your theme: Action, Conflict, Romance, Grief, Suspense, Comedy, Fear
Then roll 2D6 to establish the drama and narrate it.
Be sure to keep track of the total ratings.
 
For each die, work the following into your narration:
1-2	"Snoozefest!" 		-1 Rating
3-4	"Seen it!" 			+0 Rating
5-6	"That was AWESOME!"	+1 Rating
 
ILLUSION DICE:
To add drama you may use magic: 
Roll 1D6 adding the number to ratings. 
On a 1 it breaks the illusion (-2 Ratings)
Describe how your spell changes the drama.
 
THE END
After each apprentice films 2 scenes, each films part of a final montage, where heroes face the boss. 
Everyone narrates the finale together!
 
Enjoy the show! Post your ratings on Twitter, tagging @DiceUpGames!
