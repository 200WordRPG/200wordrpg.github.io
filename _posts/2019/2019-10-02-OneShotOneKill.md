Target: Codename Mr. White
Estimated Net Worth: $12,000,000,000
Occupation: Philanthropist
Silent donor with high spending on security, privacy, PR.
DoB: Today (year unknown)
Infiltrate party on floor 10 of the Grand Park Hotel; retrieve (1) standard 9mm handgun and (1) untraceable bullet; eliminate target.
Standard Agency Non-ID Protocol

Things that are true: 
* You are contractors working together to complete this job.
* You have never met before tonight.
* You have never heard of Mr. White before tonight.

To make a character: Tell everyone what they look like, what we should call them, and how we should refer to them.

When you try to do something specialized, make a skill check.
* Basic tasks don't require checks, even if they're a little bit hard.
* Checks don't allow you to attempt the wildly improbable.

To make a skill check:
If you have a skill that covers it, you automatically succeed.
If you don't, flip a coin. On heads, you succeed. If you succeed and no one else has a skill for this kind of thing already, write down a name for your new skill.
Whether you succeed or fail, flip again. On tails, there's a complication or repercussion.

To begin, destroy this dossier.
