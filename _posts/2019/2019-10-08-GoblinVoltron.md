----------

The players are goblins in a shared disguise (e.g. "Baron Notagoblin"). They must work together to accomplish a GOAL (e.g. "Bake a cake for the king") with as many STEPS as there are Goblins ("Gather ingredients", "Preheat oven", etc).

Goblins and GM alternate turns, until Goblins accomplish their Goal or get Busted.

----------

GM TURN
The GM throws an obstacle at the Goblins. They must either DO SOMETHING!!! or take a Problem.

----------

GOBLIN TURN
Players pick one:
- DO SOMETHING!!! (accomplish one Step of their Goal)
- FIX IT!!! (eliminate Problems)

----------

DO SOMETHING!!!
- On separate cards, Goblins each write down what they want their shared goblin voltron to do.
- Goblins reveal cards.
- Everything happens simultaneously; GM narrates the ridiculous results.
  ALL DIFFERENT: Total Chaos. Goblins accomplish their aim, but gain a Problem.
  2+ THE SAME: Controlled Chaos. Goblins accomplish their aim, and nothing else happens. Phew!
  ALL SAME: Cool Chaos. Goblins accomplish their aim, and fix a Problem in the process.

FIX IT!!!
- Pick 2 Problems.
- FIX IT!!!
- Eliminate them. (Hopefully you didn't make any more!)

----------

TOO MANY PROBLEM!!!
If Goblins have 3 or more Problems at the end of their turn, they gain a STRIKE. Three Strikes and they're BUSTED!
