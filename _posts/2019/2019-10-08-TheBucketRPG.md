Bucket RPG

SETUP:
Bucket
Pens
paper
d6

Six strips of paper each.
Write a famous name - real or fictional - on each.
On the back of each write a useful item or skill. Number these one - six.
Fold strips in half, names on the inside. 
Put strips in bucket.

Without reading it, place one strip under the bucket. This is the Villain.

Everyone take a strip from the bucket. This is your character and their skill. 

INTRODUCTIONS:
Without saying your name, tell the group your backstory. 
Player who guesses your character gets +/-1 to rolls during your henchman round.

SKILL ROLLS:
Roll d6. 
If number matches or 1 off your skill number: success.
Otherwise: success, causing new obstacle.

HENCHMAN ROUNDS:
All players draw a slip. 
One player looks at the name: they are the Villain's henchman. The others have a one-use skill.
Henchman describes their lair and two obstacles the others face. 

+/-1 to whoever guesses the henchman.

Defeat obstacles and henchman with successful skill rolls.

Repeat for all players. 

VILLAIN:
Players guess the Villain. Successful guesser plays the Villain, using remaining skills from the bucket. 
Play like henchman rounds. 
Villain is defeated with successes equal to number of players.

Very special thanks to David Harris for game writing advice. And thanks to the various friend groups throughout the years with whom I played variations of Celebrities/Bucket Game/Monikers/Salad Bowl/Lunch Box: your house rules gave me the idea to RPGify a party game.
