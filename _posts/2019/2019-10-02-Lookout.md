```
Needs:
2-4 Players
A window that looks out on an active outdoor space

Everyone sit facing the window and look out.

The window is a view-screen showing a live video feed from a nearby camera.

The view out the window is actually (choose one):
- the area outside your spacecraft, which has landed on a distant world.
- the area surrounding a secret government facility.
- the view from a remote wilderness lookout post.

Translate the real-world things you see into things that would make sense in the scenario you chose. Buildings are huge mossy boulders, birds are distant or tiny spaceships, streets are mighty rivers, people are tumbleweeds, etc.

Watch the scene attentively, mostly bored and silent, sometimes chatting idly.

Occasionally, something real or imagined outside will concern one of you. When this happens, point to it and ask your fellow players, "Wait, what is that?"

The other players will look closer, then explain why the thing you see is nothing to worry about, and you all go back to idly watching.

The game ends when someone reacts to a concern by saying, "Oh, no..." or "Oh, yes!" and all the players rush out of the room to investigate.
