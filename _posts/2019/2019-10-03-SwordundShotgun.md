You are TRAVELERS, on a perilous journey to the PROMISED LANDS.

Divide nine points among the following stats: ATHLETICS, LORE, THIEVING, PERCEPTION, CONVERSE, MAGIC KEN, SURVIVAL, and SHOTGUN.

Name and describe your traveler. Each traveler starts with a sword and clothing.

Your traveler has eight COIN. One COIN buys:
* Bandages
* SHOTGUN points
* Tools (bonus points in a stat- describe)

The NARRATOR rolls 1d6 to determine an encounter.
1: Environmental hazard
2-3: Monster encounter
4-5: Hostile humans
6: Human civilization (Trade?)

To perform a task that has any risk, roll a d6 per point in a stat. Use the highest die:
6: You succeed!
4-5: You succeed, but at cost.
1-3: Bad stuff happens.

(0 points in a stat? Hail Mary! Roll a d6 and hope you get a 6, otherwise Bad Stuff happens!)

Instead of using a stat, you may spend SHOTGUN points and roll those to shoot a problem in the face. Spent SHOTGUN points are lost forever.

Some "bad stuff" may include losing gear, temporary stat penalties, or injuries. Four injuries and your traveler dies. SURVIVAL or bandages can remove injuries.

After ten journey legs, surviving travelers reach the PROMISED LANDS. Describe them!

So this year, I was going to make a game about working the really lousy 11 am- 8 pm shift in retail called "Dulce et Decorum Est Pro THE CORPORATION Mori" (It Is Right and Proper to Die For THE CORPORATION) inspired by my many many years in retail hell. But, y'know, these games are for *escapism...*

So I went with a fantasy piece instead. Rules are slightly worse than Blades in the Dark. And by "slightly" I mean "much." The shotguns, though? A reference to my dearly departed Nosferatu from my group's *Vampire: The Masqeurade* game, Albert Hurt Johnson, who invariably dealt with every problem the coterie had by shooting it in the face with a shotgun.

Special thanks go out to Charles Bair, John Brownlee, Matthew Bulick, Joshua Carlson, Damien Heppel, Chrissy Lake, Cory Miller, Allen Neral, and Bryan Thompson for being an awesome Venn diagram of gaming groups.

*Please* don't ask me what shotguns are doing in a more or less medieval fantasy game.
