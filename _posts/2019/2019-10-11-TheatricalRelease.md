You are collaborating to make a movie. Decide what kind. However, each player has their own agenda for it. Roll 2d6 to determine what that is, re-rolling duplicates.

2- You already had this giant mechanical contraption made, so...
3- This product placement WILL happen
4- Promised role to bumbling cousin
5- Ensure staff are treated well
6- Stay within budget
7- Win a major award
8- Tell a compelling story
9- Showcase technical aspects
10- Cats are cute
11- Piss off your dad(s)
12- Characters can only speak at most 200 words
          
Each player has 3 dice. Choose a player to start with Creative Control. They describe the movie: the setting, themes, cast, plot and scenes. At any time, someone may interrupt and give a die to attempt to take Creative Control. They both roll. High roll gets Creative Control and continues describing the movie. Low roll introduces a minor complication.

Players without dice may get one from another by agreeing to a stipulation.

Player with Creative Control may ask anotherr for help to lock in an aspect of the movie. Both players lose a die each.

Once all dice are lost, the movie is released as is.
