An absurdist live-action game for 5 players based on the play, Line by Israel Horovitz.

BIG IDEAS:
-Characters stand in a line vying to be first despite conflicting understandings of what the line is for
-Every character's top priority is to be at the front of the line
-Players stay in character and act according to their motivation
-The game ends when everyone is at the front
-Play should last 15 minutes at most

PREPARING TO PLAY:
-Mark the ground where the line begins with visible tape.

CHARACTER CREATION:
Players gather in a circle and take turns answering the following aloud:
-What is your name?
-Why is it important that you are at the front?
-What don't you like about the character to your left?

Each player rolls 1d5 (or 1d4 + Id2 [scored 1 or 0]) on the following table (each player's should be different):

Line Strategy: This is how you plan to get to the front...
1. Starts at the front of the line (you got there early)
2. Fast Talking and Confusing
3. Sex Appeal
4. Bullying
5. Opportunist

PLAY:
Enter play in ascending order according to rolls (1 starts in play).
