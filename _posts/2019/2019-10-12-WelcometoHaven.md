A village of Haven was founded.

Multiple spheres shaped life of the village.
Choose sixth sphere: magic/technology/terror/deity.

History of the village is told during 5 time periods - rounds.
During each round roll 6 dice twice:

1. consecutively write one result to each sphere
2. assign each die to a sphere

Then each player:

1. narrates, how chosen sphere influences the sphere determined by written value,
2. leads the narration to either negative (1-3) or positive (4-6) conclusion, based on assigned die value.

## Nature
How do nature and weather affect the village?
What about seasons, transportation, trade routes?

## Beasts
How they affect life in the village?
Do people hunt beasts and vice versa?

## Culture
What are local traditions, rules? What's their relation to the spheres?
How people behave to themselves and foreigners?

## Individuals
Did any individuals significantly influence the village? Why?
What were the consequences of their deeds?

## Outland
What happens beyond borders?
Describe how religions, wars, and revolutions influence the village.

## Transcendence
How is its presence manifested?
Do other spheres register, control, or crave for it?

## Author Comments
I played for years as heroes and heroines. Travelled lands, cleared dungeons and visited numerous towns and villages. Then I moved forward and designed some hero-centric systems. This year I tried something different and designed a village-creation simulator into 200 words. Itâ€™s doable.
