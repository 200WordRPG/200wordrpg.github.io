DEATH RACE 20XX-500 is a game of cooperative survival. Imprisoned in a lethal track with a car and your comrades, you must complete the race while stopping corporate race sponsors from profiting off your televised demise.

BEGIN
Design your car. A car must be able to: MOVE, STOP, and CARRY A DRIVER. Otherwise, it can be anything.

SOCIALIZE
Name your car, then introduce your vehicle/yourself to the other racers. You're each other's greatest hope.

RACE
The DEATH RACE 20XX is 500 miles. An obstacle arises every 50 miles that can destroy whoever passes through.

DESIGNING OBSTACLES
Brainstorm the most dangerous barrier/trick/trap possible. It is now in the way of every driver. Sketch the racetrack and obstacles. Give them names as enjoyable as your car's.

OVERCOMING OBSTACLES
Work with your fellow drivers to figure a way out. If there seems to be no path forward, drivers can automatically pass if one driver sacrifices themself. If that's you, describe your sacrifice and check off the obstacle. 

FINISH
If every driver dies or all obstacles are overcome, the game ends. 

When you reach the end, you're free. How does it feel?

After seeing so many awesome entries in a previous 200 Word RPG competition, I told myself I had to write one someday. This time I was ready! I hope everyone enjoys escaping the corporate deathtrap abyss with their friends.
