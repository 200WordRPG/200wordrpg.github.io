```
GM: You are a caretaker, Your goal is to keep the babies safe and clean.
Players: You are a baby.  It is your goal to drive your caretaker to madness.  

Players: Call your mother, ask her on a five point scale how difficult you were as a child.  This is your energy in D6's
GM: Call your mother, ask her on a five point scale to rate your parenting skills.  Multiply this by the player count.  This is your sanity. 
 
Player: Describe a dangerous/disgusting act your baby performed, GM will determine a difficulty.  Players can combine efforts/dice.  Roll the dice pool.  4+ equals success.  Discard each 1-2.  When you are out of dice, you are sleepy and it's time for a nap.  If you roll more successes than the difficulty, GM loses sanity equivalent to difficulty fixing your mess/saving you from injury.  
GM: Set difficulty.  "Diaper blowout over expensive rug" is 1 difficulty.  Complex things like "open baby-proofed cabinet and swallow cleaning supplies" are 3.   Describe how your caretaker stops it, easily if the player rolls failure, stressfully on success.

The GM wins if all babies fall asleep.  The player win by driving the caretaker insane.
