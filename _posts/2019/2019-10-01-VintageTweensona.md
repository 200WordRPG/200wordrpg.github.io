You are TWEENS. It is the 80s/early 90s. 
You have your current: gender, orientation, self-knowledge, acknowledgement of your mental and/or physical health conditions, and communication skills. Otherwise, you are TWEENS. 
This means you have tween-sized problems, such as quizzes, having to sneak home before curfew, and deciding how to spend your allowance. You do not have adult problems, such as politics or body image issues. If there are tween-sized problems you don't want to have, you don't have those either. 
You should wear 80s/early 90s clothing such as: overalls, corduroy, pastels, patterned leggings, acid-wash denim, ringer tees, body glitter, whatever. 
Do things like: go to an arcade, bowling, laser tag, watch cartoons, take Polaroids, play old-school RPGs, run around outside, eat junk food, plan to be best friends forever, read comics, roller skate, play freeze tag, play 3D Pinball Space Cadet, download an emulator and play old games, make prank calls, draw on your arms, bake cookies, build a secret hideout/blanket fort, get lost in the woods.   
Optional: whenever anyone asks you about your friendship, pretend you are childhood friends who have reconnected after a long time.
