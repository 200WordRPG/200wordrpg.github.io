```
You are a squad of Aliens sent to Scout Earth during the 1950's.

You have Advanced Camouflage Devices, but don't know the precise settings to use.

You are to observe Normal Human Activities.

When you Observe Humans, roll d6. On a 6, you understand the situation, anything else, and you miss Significant Context and must keep observing. Your interpretation of the situation should be colored by the missing context.

Each time you observe, roll d6. On a 6, the Camouflage works, anything else, and a human starts suspecting you.

You're not authorized to hurt humans, but lying, running away, and Memory Rays are all options. To undertake something risky, roll d6. On a 4+, you succeed, anything else, and the situation gets more complicated.

Once you have successfully Observed, you may move on and find another Activity.

When you must Beam Yourself Up, make a Report. Roll a d6 and add the number of successful Observations. On a 6+, your commander is pleased. On a failure, you're sent to the cloning vats to be recycled!

Beware of: Communists, Police, Rednecks, and the Men in Black.
Use: Advanced Alien tech, Cloning Chambers, Memory Rays, Tractor Beams.
