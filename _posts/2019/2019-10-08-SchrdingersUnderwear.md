- Players become characters.

- Discuss safety and consent.

- You're on a date and it's going very well. In fact, this date could end with some (very consensual) sexy times. Trouble is, you cannot remember what underwear you're wearing. Are they 'hot', or should they have been burned long ago?

- Inexplicably there's no opportunity to check your underwear situation during the date.

- Players take turns progressing one step at a time through their date.
- Start by rolling each die to recall a memory about your underwear.
- Describe your date, integrate your memory.

- Itinerary
  - Pick Up
  - Lunch

    - 6. Touch
    - 5. Taste
    - 4. Hear
    - 3. See
    - 2. Smell
    - 1. Sudden memory (wild)
      - Limit 2 repeats

  - d4 = the recalled perception of your underwear
    - 4  -->   -->   --> 1
    - Yay / OK / Meh / Boo

  - d8 = your confidence in your recollection 
    - 8 high --> 1 low

- Track your overall confidence (d8), weighed against your perception (d4).

- During the last round, consider your overall confidence and describe how you go about revealing your underwear. Describe your underwear based on what you have deduced.
