```
Players guide a shepherd as they herd their flock through the overgrown ruins of a once great city, the former heart of a long fallen empire.

One at a time the players pick a location the herd is grazing through and the shepherd contemplates. 

The current player begins the contemplation by saying "In the olden times they used to.." and the player shares a long passed rumor, memory or tale of the old empire and their customs. Did they sell fellow men for a few scraps of gold? Did they send inexhaustible armies beyond the horizon? Do the ruins provoke awe, bemusement, fear?

The current player ends their tale by saying ".. but not anymore." The herd moves on and the next player picks a location to ruminate over. Once every player has shared two tales, the day draws to an end and the flock leaves the city.

For locations select attractions from a tourist map of any major city.
