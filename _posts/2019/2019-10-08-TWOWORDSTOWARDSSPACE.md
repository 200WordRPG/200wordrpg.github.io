```
Each player is a spaceship crew member, traveling through the deep space. Your hyperdrive knocked out and you can't do a hyperjump. The stocks of fuel and arms are minimal. Nobody considered a long flight. Fortunately, your mechanic is a gathering maniac and he got lots of stuff in the cargo. 

You have two main tasks: find some fuel to continue the flight, get something to defend the ship from the  threats of the space. From the start of each round, all players must write a two words on a different pieces of paper. This items they found in the cargo to help them push the ship forward and to defend it. All items mix in the common pile and everybody gets two items blind. Then players see, what they got and tell the story with this items helped to resolve two tasks.

The ship gets one damage for each item unused. This items get to the common area, so everybody can use them in their turn, unless they available. Nobody can't use identical words in one game. The turn passes clockwise. Each round you have only two items. Your ship can fit five damage. The mission is really important!
