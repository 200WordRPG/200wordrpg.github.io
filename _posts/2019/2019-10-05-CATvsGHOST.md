For two players

One of you is a CAT. One of you is a GHOST. The ghost is haunting the house where the cat lives with some PEOPLE.

Choose a name, pronouns, and one short tag to describe yourself. Together, describe the house and the people who live here.

Cats can be SMART or FIERCE. Ghosts can be SPOOKY or SNEAKY. People can be SCARED or COMFORTED.

The ghost begins by describing how they haunt the house. They should set up a problem for the cat. The cat then either chooses how they address the problem (smart/fierce) OR how the people react (scared/comforted). The ghost chooses the other. Both players make their choice, then reveal them. The cat describes how they handle the problem, consistent with what was chosen (e.g. fierce and comforting). Based on the cat's narration, the ghost assigns them another tag.

Now the cat sets up a problem for the ghost, to be resolved in the same way: the ghost chooses either how they address the problem (spooky/sneaky) OR how the people react (scared/comforted).

After six scenes, evaluate how the people feel. Decide together how they address the situation.

Inspired by my cat flipping out about something invisible on my wall all day.
