Assemble 3+ players.  Together, pick a fictional intellectual property that everyone knows.  

Individually, choose one iconic historical photograph (the flag-raising at Iwo Jima, for example) and two visual depictions of easily recognizable in-universe things from the chosen IP (concept art, screenshots, still frames).  Using an image editor, insert the latter into the photograph in any way you choose.  Print the result.  

Voila!  You're now SOPHISTOS, erudite denizens of Meta--a realm that is a fusion of our world and the IP--and hoo-boy, you have LOADS to say about the significance of your particular images.  Take turns presenting them.  What do they depict?  Why are they iconic on Meta?  How did each "define a generation?"  Lean into allegory.  Build on each other's details.  Be verbose.  Be pretentious.  Be "too beaucoup."  

Debate, ramble indefinitely, but don't laugh.  Ever.  Art is fucking serious.  

Anyone who breaks character or chortles is summarily demoted to PHILISTINE status.  Philistines are rubes, unfit to discuss high culture.  They ignorantly point out how goofy Sophistos sound discussing old pictures.  Philistines jeer, making crude jokes until they drag Sophistos down to their level.

When the last Sophisto succumbs (or when the last Philistine falls asleep), destroy the images.
