```
Requires:
Minor Arcana. 
Three coins per Alchemist.
D6s

One player is the King, the rest are Alchemists. Each alchemist seeks to gain the King's favor so that they can create their Magnum Opus.

The Alchemists must first choose their goal.

Power- Swords 
Health- Cups 
Knowledge- Wands 
Wealth- Coins 

Every great work has four stages. Each stage:

Each Alchemist presents the next stage of their work to the King.

Then, the other Alchemists may offer their objections. After all objections, the speaker may respond. 

Once all Alchemists have presented, the King distributes the coins based on his relative trust in each project. The Alchemists then draw a card for every coin.

After the fourth stage, the Alchemists reveal their cards that match their goal suit. Next, the Alchemists take turns attempting to debunk their opponents. 

An Alchemist may spend one of their remaining cards to explain why one of their opponent's creations doesn't work. If the King is swayed, the Alchemist may remove one of that opponent's cards. 

When no Alchemist has cards to spend, each Alchemist adds up the point values of their revealed cards.  Whichever Alchemist ends with the highest number of points has created their Magnum Opus.

If you don't have a tarot deck, this can also be played with a deck of cards- substituting swords for spades, coins for diamond, clubs for wands, and hearts for cups. 

Thanks to my players Daniel, Right David, Josh, and Kyle for playtesting this, and putting up with my alchemical ramblings.
