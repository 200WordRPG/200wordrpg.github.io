```
He's the talentless son of a legendary wizard. You are a rat skilled in the arcane arts. When you first met, you immediately recognized the significance of your pairing, and teamed up to collaboratively become the greatest mage ever.
As a rat, you cannot be seen performing magic or else you will be killed or worse. As the son of a legendary wizard, he cannot be exposed as a failure or else he will be ostracized. You found a solution. You hide under his hat and guide his actions, either whispering in his ear or pulling his hair to steer him, and he keeps your presence a secret. Together, you appear to be a single, powerful wizard. But how long can the charade last?
