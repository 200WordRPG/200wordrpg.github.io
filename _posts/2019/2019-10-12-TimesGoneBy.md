Gather a few of your oldest friends to remember the Good ol' Days when life was hard but times were good.

Begin by pouring each other a round of drinks. The oldest then welcomes you all, takes a hearty swig of their drink, and regales you with their favorite story of your times together.

If someone thinks the teller forgot something or missed something important, they take a hearty swig and remind them of what they missed. Such occasions are met with grumbles and the drinking of drinks or apologies and the nodding of heads. Mistakes are fixed and missing details are worked into the tale.

If someone thinks the teller got something wrong, they take a hefty gulp of drink and explain how it *really* happened. Such occasions are met with raucous chatter as the drinker now tells the story.

Anyone finishing their drink gets the final say. Drink-less drinkers may still assert afterwards, albeit unreliably or unconvincingly.

The tale isn't worth ending if the table runs out of drink. Pour another round, tell a different tale. 

If a tale reaches its end, raise your glasses and toast to the Good ol' Days. Down your drinks and pour another.

Inspired by a now shelved mechanic from a game a few friends and I are designing. Can be played with the drink of your choice, alcoholic or otherwise. Stay safe and drink responsibly, folks.
