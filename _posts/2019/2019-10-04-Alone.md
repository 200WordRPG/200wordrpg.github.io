Alone is an immersive, narrative game for either one (solo), or two+ people.

You wake up and everyone is gone. Even the internet, which still exists, seems devoid of people.

You need:
A diary: notebook and pen, digital notepad, or recording app
30+ minutes every day for a week
A private space
Optional: headphones

Spend at least thirty minutes each day without any human company. If your environment is usually filled with human sounds, use headphones and play white noise. Please be aware of your limits and end the game if it affects you too much.

Contemplate these things while you sit in silence for 15-20 minutes. Then take 10-15 minutes to chronicle (write, speak, or draw) about it in your diary.
Day 1: The first person you noticed missing
Day 2: The first house (other than your own) you checked
Day 3: The first social media platform you checked
Day 4: The first public building you checked
Day 5: Who you miss the most
Day 6: How you fill your days now 
Day 7: You found another person! Exchange diaries (you can do this online). If a solo game: Describe finding signs of another person
