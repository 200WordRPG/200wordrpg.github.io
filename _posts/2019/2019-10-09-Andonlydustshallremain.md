```
GM: prepare a setting, characters with a backstory, scenes and a detailed plot, then ignore all of it entirely and improvise on the spot. Do not hesitate to resort to nonsense and non-sequiturs. Occasionally ask for a die roll of any kind and pretend the result affected anything in the narration.

Player: create a character with desires, flaws and drives, then justify during every scene why they need not abide by these. After each scene, ponder - in character - about the causes for your actions, the goals you tried to achieve, and how it makes you feel. Notice in particular similarities between your character's and your own emotions.

All: after each session, decide whether the game world is fair. Try to define fairness together. Wonder how much of that fairness is the GM's responsibility, and how much depends on the players' expectations, and how much comes from the rules of the game. Conclude with potentially misguided analogies between the game world and real life.

Play until everyone knows deeply in their souls that nothing matters, and then you die.
