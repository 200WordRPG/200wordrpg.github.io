You are medieval infantry. There are a lot of angry horsemen coming your way. This is deeply unpleasant and arguably unfair, but it is your lot in life. Your sole objective is to survive.

Roll d6s, lowest number is in front. Highest is in back. Reroll ties or negotiate until you have a hierarchy.

Describe the battlefield and situation. The course of battle. The state of your commander. Your relationships with each other.

The cavalry are on their way. Before they hit, the first row declares if they Hold or Run, followed by the second row, and so on. Whenever a row Runs, the rows behind them move up to fill their space.

When they hit, everyone who Holds rolls a d6. If you're in the first row, you survive on a 6. In the second, you survive on a 5 or 6. In the third, you die on a 1-3 and Run on 4. Behind third, you die on a 1 and Run on a 2.

If there are 1 or fewer remaining lines, the cavalry breaks through and runs down the retreat. Everyone who Ran rolls a d6. Die on 1-3.

Props to Lurker, Cetash, EricD, and the rest of the SufficientVelocity military history nerds for the idea.
