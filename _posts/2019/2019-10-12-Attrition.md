Attrition is a two-player game about clashing forces.
You are on the same team, working together to win.
You need 3 ten-sided dice and 4 index cards to play.

Setup:
Decide the setting and scale of the conflict, from gangs to armies.
Name each side and decide which side you are playing on.

Choose 3 advantages for your side (training, reputation etc.).
Choose 4 obstacles you must overcome (zealotry, chokepoints etc.).
Record these on two index cards.

Each player secretly records their favourite type of plan on an
index card (violent, stealthy etc.). Never reveal this.

Play:
On your turn the other player asks you: "What's the plan?"

Announce which obstacle you are attacking with what advantage. Briefly
narrate your plan.

The other player silently hands you dice:
-one by default
-another if they think it could work
-another if it matches their favourite plan type

Roll.
- On 11+, cross out the obstacle. You overcome it.
- On 10-, cross out your advantage. You lose it.
You narrate the result as the OTHER SIDE in the conflict.
Pass turn.

Endgame:
If all obstacles are gone you win, if all advantages are gone you
lose. Take turns briefly narrating the aftermath.

I literally heard about the design challenge yesterday and decided "Why not?" Here's hoping people like this idea that's been in my mind for a good little while. Thanks to the Gauntlet for being an awesome community for a beginner and showing me this contest.
