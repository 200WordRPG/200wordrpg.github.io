```
Premise:
It's time to eat. You want to go somewhere, but you are also with a group. If you admit you only want Baja Blast they may think less of you, so it's time to lie and connive and make them think they decided on getting that sweet sweet blue liquid. 

Don't ever admit what you really want.

Don't ever make compromises.

PREPARATION:
Write down 3 aspects of the restaurant you want to go to:
one foodstuff such as "serves hummus"
one aesthetic  such as" goofy shit on the walls"
one vibe such as "awkwardly horny"

Keep 2, and put the other in a hat. Everyone playing will draw another aspect from the hat. 

Now write what you consider the antithesis of the restaurant you want to go to. Horny Hardee's, for example, is the antithesis of chaste Red Lobster. This is your Veto card.

VOTING:
A vote must be proposed and seconded before voting starts.

A majority vote will end the game unless it gets hit with a Veto card.

CONCLUSION:
If you don't get everything you have ever wanted; you lose. 

You have 10 minutes. Agree on lunch or you must go to Taco Bell

I dedicate this game to filibustering for long enough to get 3am Taco Bell.
