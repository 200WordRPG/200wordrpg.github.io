You are tree-folk gathering to share stories of your kin.

Entmoot requires fallen leaves. It's best on a windy day surrounded by trees, friends, and little else.

Pick a leaf. Damaged gnarled shredded desiccated is best.

It's a record of your family. Find a rib with defects. Your kin's story.

Look up at the tree. Your kin. Its movement. Shape. Imagine how they walk. Speak. Watch. Their name.

Follow the rib. Tell your kin's story in turns.

A forking is a sapling's birth. What were they taught they began their wanderings?

A spot is conflict. Who or what did they encounter? Did they quarrel?

A hole is adventure outside the forest. What new things did they see, achieve?
(Lay your leaf over another's, positioning the adventure over their rib. What was their kin doing? How were they involved?)

At leaf's edge, tell of your kin's death.

If it's worm-eaten, they were consumed. By what? Were they resentful, or happy to provide sustenance?

If it's curled, they were felled. Were they cut, or toppled in a storm?

If it's browned, they burned. What grows from their ashes?

When you're finished, find another rib or leaf, another kin. Tell their story.
