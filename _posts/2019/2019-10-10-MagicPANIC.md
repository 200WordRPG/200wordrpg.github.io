As brave emergency service workers, players must use magic to arrive at and resolve crises daily.
One player is the reporter who chooses and depicts the emergencies instead.
Start the game with at least three emergencies.
Example: Breaking News! Warehouse fire across town caused by batteries is spreading, employees are trapped inside the building, a chemical cloud is moving over the city!
Magic governs play, with players casting spells following the format:
"I want to [protect, harm, alter] [object, person] with a [line, field, ball] of [fire, water, wind, earth, lightning]"
A d12 is rolled to determine a positive (>=4) or negative (<4) outcome.
A negative outcome downgrades the player's dice (e.g. d12 becomes d10).
A player is removed in dramatic fashion when they downgrade a d4.
Example: I want to protect the labourers with a ball of water! *Rolls 3 on d4*
The reporter interprets the spell and narrates outcome.
Negative outcomes change emergencies and positive outcomes resolve emergencies.
Example: The water ball amasses from your fluids; you die and begin drowning employees!
The game ends with a news report when either the players are removed, or all the emergencies are cleared.
