The table works to appease The Kraken. 

Gameplay is two parts: First, players gather items to appease The Kraken. Second, players ensure the success of the annual festival. 

The game only needs 1d6+(stat mod) rolls to complete easy(5), medium(6), or hard(7) tasks. DM can increase difficulty.

Character Creation: Roll 1d6 for each stat-this is both total and modifier.

Part One
DM tells a legend that indicates the Kraken's likes & dislikes. Based on this legend, the players announce what they will each gather for the festival. Players can help each other-or sabotage each other if they think another player's idea won't appease. The DM presents at least one obstacle for each effort to gather.

Part Two
Players attend the festival and must ensure optimum festivities. Each must contribute to the festival in some way. DM presents one problem at the festival per player.

Ending: Kraken Judgment
At the appropriate time in the festival, the Kraken evaluates the offerings gathered and the quality of the festivities. If the Kraken is appeased, the Kraken slumbers for another year. If the Kraken is displeased, there is a Kraken Rampage.
