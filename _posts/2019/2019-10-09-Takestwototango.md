```
You are the fire brigade planning a rescue action. 
Tasks: 
- Putout fire. 
- Move to floor above.
You need to successfully pass max levels you can without errors. 

Before a round starts players should write down 2 items on 2 cards.
Mix all to deck. Pull 2 cards to your hand. You'll take these items to mission. 

Try to write funny words and then correctly explain it by acting a role of firefighter in trouble! 
For example: you got word "GOAT". 
You think 5 seconds and say "I milk the goat and putout fire". 
You did it! Task One solved. 
Now you need move to another floor (Task Two). 
You pulled "GASOLINE" word. Using your brain you can say "I fill jet pack with gasoline and soar to next floor". 
Good job. Pass turn to next player. 

Gameplay subtlety is to come up with not simple things for FIRE PROBLEM / MOVING ON FLOOR. 
If an item appears more than ones - you can't use it. Game chain will be stopped. Do not use "extinguisher" and "ladder" often then. 

Replay rounds and try to score 30 floors and more! And then get another setting: Farmers (Garden / Manufacture), Bandits (Crime / Chasing) Hospital, Espionage, etc.
