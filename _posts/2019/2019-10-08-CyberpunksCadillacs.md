```
You are cyberpunks en route via Cadillac on a very dangerous road. With the GM behind the wheel, will you be able to survive this vicious road ahead?

State the reason for traveling and choose a GM.
Characters get 3 body modifications and weapons. Explain their functions.
Write down any relevant Character info. 

Each Player writes on note cards:
5 threats they might encounter
2 locations with brief descriptions
Hand these to the GM

The GM will write down:
10 events
5 positive
5 negative

Once GM has all cards the game begins. 
GM plays cards in any order to craft the narrative.

Checks:
Roll d6. 
1-3 is failure 3-6 is success. Advantage or disadvantage may be granted by GM depending on situation.

Combat:
Players go first unless ambushed
Roll d6 for initiative
Characters or enemies on successful checks deal 1 damage unless stated otherwise.
When a Character is damaged they break a modification, when all modifications are broken they retire.

Enemies:
GM may introduce enemies on the road and locations once per 2 cards played.
Roll d6 to determine health.
Create unique conditions to defeat.

Play until Characters have retired or until all locations are visited.
