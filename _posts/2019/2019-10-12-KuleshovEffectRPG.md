```
Players explore mysterious castle/cave/laboratory/etc. where surprises lurk behind every corner.

Character: two Skills ('Swimming'), one Item ('Crossbow'), two Traits ('Generous', 'Arachnophobic').

Resolution: 1d20, 10+ for partial, 15+ for full success. Add +1 if prepared, +1 if relevant Item, +1 if relevant Skill, +1 per xp spent, -1 if relevant impediment.

Players take turns being Leader. Whenever the party turns a corner or discovers something new, the Leader makes a Kuleshov roll - 2d20 on the table:

1. Bizarre
2. Clever
3. Deadly
4. Disgusting
5. Enormous
6. Familiar
7. Funny
8. Hostile
9. Legendary
10. Mundane
11. Mysterious
12. Old
13. Ominous
14. Reassuring
15. Revelatory
16. Suspicious
17. Unique
18. Unreliable
19. Useful
20. Valuable

The Leader then describes what they see according to the adjectives they rolled.

e.g. Disgusting + Useful = skeleton key made from human bones
Hostile + Unique = angry albino zebra

Doubles mean the opposite of the adjective rolled.

+1 xp when you overcome significant danger or when your Trait interferes with the party's interests.
Spend 1xp to add +1 to resolution roll, 1xp to reroll 1 Kuleshov die, 5xp for new Skill.

GM has final say on all disputes.
