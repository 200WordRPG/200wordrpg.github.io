This game emulates an escalating war. Dedication ultimately decides the victor, not luck. 

Those who dare, win.

------------------------------------------------------------
RULES:
------------------------------------------------------------

Have real stakes, like cash. Commitment is vital.

Every DICECON level, each competing player/team follows the instructions, and proceeds.

">ROLL" = roll all dice and tally your total.

Dice may have any number of sides, but values cannot exceed them. 
(d100 = valid. d4 with a 5 =/= valid) 

All dice MUST be rolled simultaneously and land flat. Equipment allowed to assist rolling.

Move each dice from field after it's tallied.

Any properly-labeled *fair* object can = dice. No coins/electronics.

Dice untallied after 24h become forfeit.

Highest score wins.

------------------------------------------------------------

This certainly isn't a traditional RPG, but definitely something I'd want to play myself!
