You remember nothing. The three faces look intently at you. Your dissertation defense committee. A Reader says, "The title of your dissertation is..." and they tell you the title, but you remember nothing. 

One player is the Student, three are Readers. The Student is doing their final defense of a doctoral dissertation, but they have forgotten everything about it. The Readers should leave the Student alone to create a dissertation title that the player playing the Student knows nothing about. After telling the Student the title, the Readers ask questions of the Student about the dissertation. The questions should be specific and leading. Readers can ask as many questions as they want. Take turns. When all three Readers are satisfied, they decide if the Student passes or fails. It must be unanimous, or the Student fails. 

Reader Advice
Everything you say is true, even if it is contradictory. Prove you are the expert. Add pieces to the dissertation and ask the Student to explain them. Create a theory and ask why the Student didn't consider it. Say, "I see," a lot, ominously. 

Student Advice
No one can help you. Godspeed.
