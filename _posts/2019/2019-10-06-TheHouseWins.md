The person running the game is The House. All other participants are Players.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Players:

Roll on each row of the wealth table, then answer the following:

-What was your first big win?
-Why do you need a win so badly?
-How much will be enough?

There are three rules all Players must follow:
1) Every hand you win, state a dream for your future.
2) Every hand you lose, state something you missed or lost while playing.
3) You may not willingly leave the table while you or The House has money. If asked to leave the table, justify why you are staying.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The House:

Decide on the game to be played. Blackjack is recommended. Bet in $1,000 increments.

The House begins with $100,000,000.

After each hand, gently encourage one player to leave the table.

You may choose to end the game only once you have decided that all Players have nothing left to lose.
