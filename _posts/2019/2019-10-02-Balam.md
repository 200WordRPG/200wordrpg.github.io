```
Played at midnight inside a house by candlelight only. All players roll 1D6. Lowest player's spirit has been separated from their body by the demon Balam. They must lay on the floor, lifeless. Remaining players must cover the body with items from the house (sheet, blanket, etc.) so the spirit-player can "take shape" and play (blindly).
Players roam from room to room investigating, trying to find items-jackets, mugs, photos-that are only black and white. These are items left by Balam. All players create Balam's narrative (why it is here, why it chose the afflicted player) using the found items as prompts. Player who found item rolls: 1D6 = 1. their spirit is also abducted 2. is paralyzed for five minutes 3. cannot speak for five minutes 4. must hug another player for five minutes 5. Balam makes one player stomp on the floor six times 6. next item can have one color.
The afflicted player(s) must carry all items. Afflicted player(s) spirit(s) returns to their body when three D5 or D6 items are found. If all players' spirits are abducted, the game (and they) are lost.
