#### 3+ players, d6(*) and coins ####

 ---###---

You're a...
*Neurotic...	        *Scientist...
*Thickly-Accented...	*Engineer...
*Belligerent...	       	*Pilot...
*Superstitious...	*Passenger...
*Cowardly ...   	*Linguist...
*Robot...	        *Medic...

...on a rocket-ship exploring uncharted-space.

Secretly you're...
*...terminally-ill.
*...engaged.
*...3-days from retirement.
*...expecting a baby.
*...the rocket-company owner.
*...a spy! (Improvise!)

 ---###---

Introduce your character; role-play radio-chatter. After a few minutes take-turns flipping a coin.

On the third 'tails', the rocket violently explodes because of a...
*...core-meltdown!
*...robot mutiny!
*...computer-malfunction!
*...cosmic-storm!
*...space-squid!
*...tear in space-time!

Suddenly you're all blasted into deep-space! You hear panicking-survivors on your radio. One life-pod pings on your suit-instruments...

 ---###---

Center the life-pod (biggest coin) between the players; everyone places a space-suit (coin) on their table-edge.

Take-turns flicking your space-suit across the table to reach the life-pod and avoid or kill other survivors. Role-play your radio-chatter. 

Remember there's only one seat! 

 ---###---

If your space-suit:
-falls off the table, you're lost-in-space but can still curse the others via radio!
-stops within coin-width of the life-pod you grab-on.
-stops within coin-width of another space-suit, push-away (flick again) or you...
*...burn alive from a fuel-leak! 
*...both die from the impact!
*...struggle but escape!
*...just miss each-other!
*...smash their helmet!
*...fry them with your ray-gun! 

 ---###---  

To win, be the last-survivor.

## Author Comments
I like to design fast-paced games with an emphasis on improvisation that spark the imagination but (most importantly) can be easily played at the pub and learned by new players in a matter of seconds!

Kaleidoscope is inspired by the Ray Bradbury short-story of the same name in which a dozen space-men are thrown out of their rocket ship after a mysterious disaster. They learn a lot about themselves and each-other in the short horrifying hours they have left before meeting their various fates.
