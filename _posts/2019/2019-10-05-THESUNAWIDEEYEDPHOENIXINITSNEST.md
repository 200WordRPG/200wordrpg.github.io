For one player.

Retha's community sucked its land dry. But, according to myth, if Retha slaughters the phoenix that wanders daytime skies, life will be restored.

Retha has an axe, a pair of wax wings, a breastplate, and no better ideas. They're currently hanging from the phoenix's talons.

As they act, roll six dice. If they used a tool, choose any numbers, then reroll all dice showing those numbers.

SCALING THE PHOENIX
If you didn't roll a...
    1: Retha falls off and plummets.
    2: Retha can't climb higher.
    3-4: There's no opportunity to strike.
    5: Sacrifice a tool.
    6: Retha's crushed, near-lethally.

STRIKING THE HEAD
Roll only three dice if you have no weapon. If you didn't roll...
    two 1-2s: Retha fall off and plummet.
    four odds/evens: Sacrifice a tool.
    two 6s: Retha can't make wounds last.

CHEATING DEATH
If you didn't roll a...
    1: The phoenix cries, anguished.
    2: We remember Retha as naive.
    3: We remember Retha as gullible.
    4: We remember Retha as weak.
    5: Retha cannot cheat death. (The game ends.)
    6: The myth is fake.

After two wounds, the phoenix plummets, a fallen star. Is life restored?

Made while watching a video essay on Shadow of the Colossus.

This game definitely occupies a weird space in my library. While it condemns you 

Nothing but love for @fencedforest and @mossytoes for editing help. Buy their games.
