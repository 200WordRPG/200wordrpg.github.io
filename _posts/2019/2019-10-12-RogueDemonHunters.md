You are Rogue Demon Hunters. You do not hunt demons. 

NOTE: Demons can be anything.

One player, the MARK, offers a quest: Hunt the DEMON.

Don't. 

Return to the Mark. Make up a story.

   Your character has a fake Persona: [Name] the [Adjective] ("Yoksur the Mighty"), with a fake backstory.
   Skills: BOAST, FLEX, and FAKE. 
   Choose: two are 1d6, one 2d6. 
   5-6 = success.

   Boast: lie stylishly.
   Flex: demonstrate prowess. 
   Fake: provide "proof" (demon head, etc.). 

Demon Ratings (The Mark decides): 50+. 50 = easy. 1,000 = legendary.
The Mark can challenge your facts, your prowess, or require proof. 
Roll one skill to convince. 
Succeed and earn WOW. The Mark decides how much. 1 = barely, 5 = completely.
Faked proof can be retconned into existence.
When WOW > DR, receive gold = WOW / 5, or continue for more.
If you fail a roll, gain DOUBT, 1-5 (the Mark's choice). When DOUBT > WOW + 5, you fail.
For every successful hunt, gain 1 FAME. 
For each unsuccessful hunt, gain 1 INFAMY. 
If INFAMY > FAME, leave town and create new persona.

Spend gold on glitzy fake gear. Every 5 gold spent = 1 reroll on a failed convince. 
Spend 20 gold to lose 1 Infamy.
