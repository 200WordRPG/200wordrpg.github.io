In Life is Hard, you must go about a totally normal day and survive. Goals are simple: Getting to class on time, for example Everyone is encouraged to play a character rather than relying on a single GM/DM, as all players are expected to tell the story together. 

Best done in round-table fashion, taking turns to take actions, everyone should narrate the person on their right, and once their portion of the action is complete, control passes to the person who just narrated.

To take an action, players roll a 20 sided dice, on a 15 plus, you succeed without issue, on a 14 or lower, something terrible happens. Attacked by savage squirrels while walking through the park, having to fight off the janitorial staff at school who all turned into zombies suddenly, use your imagination! Players must describe how they get out of these terrible happenings. Actions should be clear and concise, IE "Take a shortcut through the park". 

All players start with 0 damage marked, and take 1 damage from each terrible happening. Once they hit 5 damage, they're dead!

Game ends when all players or dead, or someone reaches the end of their daily routine.
