The person with the lightest eyes says: Welcome to this space. This space is safe. I value you, myself, and this space we are sharing. I am ready to be your witness and be witnessed by you.

The person with the darkest eyes then says the same thing back.

Decide who will speak first. The other person will witness.

The speaking person then tells a story from their past, an event or moment they are uncomfortable with, not proud of, or that is a confession of something they feel guilty for. The story can be short, long, or somewhere in between. They may also speak about something they dislike or are insecure about themselves. Give all the context needed. 

Once the story is told and silence is hanging, the witnessing person reaches over, takes the speaking person's hands, holds them gently, looks into their eyes and says, "You are beautiful."

The hands are released once the speaking person says, "Thank you."

The experience proceeds going back and forth until either person says, "Thank you for witnessing me and letting me witness you." 

The other person responds, saying the same, and the experience is over.
