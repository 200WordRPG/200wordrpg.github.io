THE SAILOR'S LAST SONG

An erotic roleplaying game for two or more
by Steve Dee

One Player is the Sailor. Their hands are bound (loosely) and their eyes are covered.

They begin with a song:
"I am a sailor, lost at sea
I wish my love was here with me
Afore this watery death I die
One last song to her I'll cry"

The sailor then describes what he would do if only their love was there. What they might wish to do as a last parting gift.

The Other Player(s) are the Water Spirits. Hearing the sad yet powerful song, they respond to show their enjoyment. But being made of water, they cannot speak or touch. They can only respond with what they are: wetness.

The greater the story appeals to the Spirits, the more moisture they might perhaps apply.

When the story is over, the Water Spirits kiss the sailor as he dies. 

Swap roles.
