A dark tale for two players.

You're lost at sea, alone in the open water, struggling to survive. It's dark, it's cold. You're terrified. You must stay awake until rescue arrives.
As you slowly freeze, your hallucinated future self appears and urges you to keep fighting.

How to play:
In turns, draw a card and describes a memory associated with its theme. Future self describes events that have not yet happened to you.
When someone draws the card "Death?", decide together if you survive.

Cards:
Death? (epilogue)
A deal with God
Sunset
The most truly fantastic smile
Let me be weak
Not a soul, only me
Under the ivy
Wake up, sleepy head
A stone around my leg
Where the crossroads meet
Never say goodbye
I won't forget
Driving home
Murderer of calm!
Somewhere in the depth there is a light
Born again
Bad dreams
Three wishes
Joy and then more joy
Something moving under
I know your face well
The little line in my palm
Waking up crying
What made it special made it dangerous
I can't hide you
Something good is gonna happen
You don't hear what I'm saying, do you?
Peekaboo
Favourite place
Give away a secret
```

"The cold grave" is heavily inspired by Kate Bush's "The Ninth Wave" and its title is a reference to Thomas Hood's poem "The Silence" (and from the movie "The Piano" which quotes it). All the cards are taken from Kate Bush's lyrics. In a way, "The cold grave" could be considered a Descended from the Queen game :)
