```
You are clones of Subject Zero.
Clones are illegal, secret or problematic.

Together, create 6 Original Traits for Subject Zero
Your clone has 3 Original Traits. Without consulting with the other players, pick 3 Unique Traits

Setup (Each player answers)
How did you discover your nature? Who's the Most Important Person to you?

Play
R&D (the GM) sets the scene. Start with each clone's MIP. Roll dice when something is uncertain, setting stakes before each roll. After each scene, if you lost a roll, change a Trait. Change a Unique Trait to an Original Trait or vice-versa. You can use new or existing Unique Traits. The game ends when one clone has only Unique Traits or Original Traits. Each player picks an epilogue, most Original Traits first. Cross off an epilogue after it is picked.

Rolls
R&D sets difficulty X from 2-6 (average 3) and rolls Xd6. The clone rolls 1d6, +1d6 for each applicable Trait. Helping players can add 1d6 for each matching Trait. Total the two highest dice. On ties, R&D wins, and a twist occurs (betrayal, unexpected ally, a new clone, etc.).

Epilogues
Tables Turned
Home
Trapped
New Legacy
Worst Fear
Greatest Hope
