The world has ended, and only the people in your hotel survived.  The building is secure and supplies are plentiful. 

All of you were attendees at a Stand Up Comedy Convention. With nothing left to do, you perform routines.  Forever.

During each game (or Show), players take it in turns to perform Sets of an agreed length (one minute is ideal). Each player has three Sets per Show.  

A player's sets should each cover one of the following topics: the player's backstory, the nature of the apocalypse, and the world that remains. (Like all stand-up comedy, actual laughs are ideal, but in no way required).

During the game, players must use the following phrases at least once each:

"Who else remembers..."
"Don't you just hate it when..."
"What is the deal with..."

After each player has performed three Sets, the group should vote on the winner.  Consideration should primarily be given to players who crafted a cohesive character, setting and narrative.  Lesser consideration should be given to whether the comedians were actually funny.
