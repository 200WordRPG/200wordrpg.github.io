```
The players are Magi in the decadent court of a furious Tyrant. You wear silk robes and smell of incense. Aside from your wisdom, you are helpless. You start with five tokens.

Start the scene by writing down an event in secret. ("Noble blood spills", "Poor harvest", etc)

Starting with the player who slept latest today, take turns describing an image in the Tyrant's dream (a rose, a coyote, etc) linked to your secret event.

In the same order, choose if you wish to spend a token to declare that a certain subject is banned due to the Tyrant's anger.

Take turns giving prophecies based on the dream. If anyone mentions a banned subject, they must spend a token.

Share your secret events. As a group, select two Magi: the Favorite, who gave the kindest prophecy, and the True Prophet, who gave the most correct prophecy.

The Favorite takes half the tokens spent this round, and describes what the Tyrant does.

The True Prophet takes the other half, and describes what happens in the country.

The next scene begins. When a Magus runs out of tokens, they still participate. The game lasts until the country falls.
