Each player names and nobly titles their demonic courtier and secretly allocates 100 points across the following: 
Malfeasance
Exhortation
Dereliction
Contrivance

In ascending order of Malfeasance, players take turns trying to Goad, Beg, or Trick dread lord Azathoth into destroying one aspect of the world by rolling a 100-sided die and seeing if the result is lower than their rating in Exhortation, Dereliction, or Contrivance, respectively. If it is, the player to take their turn after them determines the method of destruction and describes it.

A player can only Trick Azathoth if the player before them succeeded. When a player Tricks Azathoth successfully, they undo that player's destruction.

After a player successfully Goads Azathoth, their Exhortation is permanently divided in half and until their next turn no other player may Goad or Trick Azathoth.

At any time a player may declare their courtier "satisfied." Other players get one more turn each before Azathoth becomes bored and returns to slumber, then the game ends and the group interprets the remnants of the world as a possible setting for a future tabletop rpg.
