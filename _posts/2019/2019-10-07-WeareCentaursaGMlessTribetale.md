```
We hunt.
We protect Backwoods.
We proclaim Prophecies.

We do not help Outsiders.
We do not abandon Tribe.
We do not disturb Order.

Assume !Duties. !Duties narrate #Circumstances when needed:
!Weatherwatcher:	#Backwoods, #Elements
!Perilwarner:		#Outsiders, #Beasts
!Elderthinker:		#Tribe-life, #Wisdom
Describe one threat to Tribe for every #Circumstance. 

Name three Tribe-Centaurs each.
Describe their doings. Narrate circumstances.
Together, tell the Tribe-tale.


Hunting:
Ask others for help, for day.
-Each hunter gathers one [Supply, choose from: [Beast [Plant [Stone.
or
-Together discover one new ?Omen.

Protecting:
Sum involved ]Protectors and distinct [Supplies spent.
You...
]+[=1: ...are harmed
]+[=2: ...escape, harmed
]+[=3: ...escape
]+[=4: ...are harmed, what you protected is safe
]+[=5: ...and what you protected is safe

When harmed, you cannot Hunt and Protect for two days, burdening Tribe.

Propheting:
Spend [Supply.
Cross-out known ?Omens, and proclaim Prophecy concerning them.
Other Tribe-Centaurs settle implications of Prophecy's fulfillment:
-Which Tribe-Centaur will be Chosen?
-Will Backwoods provide?
-Will Outsiders harass Tribe?
-Will Tribe move?

When you fulfill three Prophecies, create and assume new !Duty with new #Circumstance.
Every thing can belong to one #Circumstance only.

If you'll behave un-Centaurish, you'll scorn Tribe. 
First-time means Warning. Second-time means Branding. Third-time means Exiling.

That is Order.

## Author Comments
Thanks to Havock, Maniek, Chorzo, Budek, Tafit and many others for playtesting, proofreading and suggestions.

If you would like to expand the "Protecting" mechanism, here is my suggestion:

Protecting:
!Duty determines %Difficulty of narrated #Circumstance.
%2=dangerous accidents
%12=otherwordly threats
Sum ]Protectors involved and distinct [Supplies spent.
You...
]+[=%: ...are harmed
]+[=%+1: ...escape, harmed
]+[=%+2: ...escape
]+[=%+3: ...are harmed, what you protected is safe
]+[=%+4: ...and what you protected is safe
