```
You have each been kidnapped and abandoned by the GM in a labyrinth controlled by a magic cube. You party up to try escape.
Have the GM scramble a Rubik's Cube and place it down. 
This is the 'gameboard'. Players start at the top-right and end at the bottom-left tile, moving in an 'S' shape.

Players create their character by choosing descriptors - name, 1 equip, 2 attributes.
The GM assigns a power value to each tile colour:
Sum of all (six) colours' values <= no. players times 6. 
Maximum colour value equals no. players times 3.

Each turn, the GM creates the conflict, using the tile's colour as a prompt. Players cooperate to create a plan of action that must incorporate a number of descriptors >= the colour's power value. Planning time = 15 times no. players in seconds.

If the party wins, they describe the outcome and move to the next tile.
If the party loses, GM describes the outcome and rotates 3 rows/columns. Then the party moves back one tile (move forward instead if on first tile).

When rotating, the party stays on their tile. Afterwards, their tile should face up. 

Party wins when the bottom-left tile's conflict is resolved.
