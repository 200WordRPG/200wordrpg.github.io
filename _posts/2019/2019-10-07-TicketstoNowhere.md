```
Get a slip of paper.
Get someone to stamp it.
If it's stamped, you get to play the game.

Use the stamp to imagine this slip of paper is a ticket to somewhere.

Imagine this somewhere.
Draw this somewhere on the slip.
Write on the back of the drawing all of the promise of that somewhere.
Three good things.

Hand the ticket to someone you trust, but don't let go.
As they hold the ticket, describe in frantic detail the somewhere you want to go.
Ask them if they'd like to go too.

If they don't, that's fine.
Go about your business.

If they do, then they'll need a ticket too.
Have them get a slip of paper, draw on it, write good things, and again find a third party to stamp it.

[Repeat the above with other trusted friends until you have a group of the right size.]

Get some tape.
With your group and stamped tickets, go to a bus shelter and tape them on the glass there.
Say aloud as a group:
"This isn't where we're going, but they cannot take our tickets away either."

Give each other high-fives and go get some drinks.
