We are (3-7) poker players but the game is only an excuse, everybody knows, maybe you even don't know how to play.

Poker deck: remove the aces, mix them, put them in the middle of the table.

Role: each player draws a secret card.
Diamonds: you are a cheater, find your piggy bank.
Hearts: you are you. stay at the game.
Spades: undercover FBI agent. Find the culprit.
Club: you are a psychopath; find the prey.

Shuffle the remaining cards, deal 5 to each player.

Game:
Each chooses 1 secret card and simultaneously reveals it, the highest wins, the owner asks a question to another player.
Those questioned must tell the truth, but with circumspection, everyone listens.
Repeat 3 times.

End of the game, the bravest reveals the first covered ace:
Diamonds: cheaters tell how they have squeezed their one out.
Hearts: wake up! Your work awaits you, choose it from the other roles. Why did you choose it?
Spades: the agents arrest. What crimes have been committed?
Club: psychopaths kill. Why precisely those prey?

This is my first try at 200 word RPG challenge. It’s deadly difficult. Seems that nothing can be fitted into, also, my english is trash.
The idea was to make a game with poker cards, using poker cards as (more or less) poker cards with at least a bit of poker’s tension.
