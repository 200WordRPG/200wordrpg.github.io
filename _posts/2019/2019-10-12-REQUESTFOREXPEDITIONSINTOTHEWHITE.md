What have they promised this time for RISKING your life exploring ever deeper 
   down into the city's trapped abandoned mazelike underbelly?


Why do they want you to RISK your sanity near the WHITE?


Who RISKS their reputation by authorising resources?


Who might cross you?



SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR THE FROZEN TOWER-CITY OED
===============================================

The GUIDE will lead you.

When you RISK something, establish CONSEQUENCES together.
   ACCEPT, AVOID, or SUGGEST A COMPROMISE for each or FAIL.

AVOID CONSEQUENCES by ROLLING your D20 bellow your STAMINA.

CONSEQUENCES may be missed OPPORTUNITIES 
   or have no COMPROMISE.

Circumstances may impose or grant REROLLS 
   and/or CONSEQUENCES.

Subtract HARM from STAMINA,
   then AVOID getting KOed. 

Spend LUCK to negate HARM.

SAFE RESTS recover STAMINA.

BREAKS refill LUCK. 

Discuss, continue.

My minimalist mashup of mostly Into The Odd by Chris McDowall and WhiteHack by Christian Mehrstam. 

 Two years ago I was inspired by this challenge to try to reduce the core rules of "Into The Odd" to a minimal form. Since then i had this file lingering on my computer. Ever changing. Now you have it too.

Thanks to John Harper, Slade Stolar  and Jones Smith of https://wasitlikely.blogspot.com for the mindblowing idea to put the "success with a cost" into the players hands.

Also thanks to my playgroup for their feedback.
