```
2+ Players
Needs: A timer, pen and paper
 
The villain that's hounded you and your friends for years is on the ground, bleeding to death. Out of desperation, they ask for a chance to explain their actions.
 
Designate one person as the villain, and the others as adventurers. Each adventurer writes down a crime the villain has committed against them.
 
Set the timer to 10 minutes and reveal the crimes to the villain, then count to five and start the timer. The villain picks a crime and explains why they chose to commit it, and the adventurers may ask questions as they like. Whenever an adventurer is satisfied, they may write an X next to that crime. When half the adventurers, rounded up, have written an X, cross that crime out and add five minutes to the timer. The villain repeats the process with a new crime.
 
When all crimes have been crossed out, the villain is allowed to live. The adventurers may choose what the villain must do afterwards as penance.
 
When the timer ends, the villain breathes their last and dies.
