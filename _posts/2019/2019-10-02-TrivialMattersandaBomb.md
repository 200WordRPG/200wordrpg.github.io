A Dinner Conversation for Seven or Less


This world is

beautiful.

broken.



Ours is also both of those things.

How odd.

Moving on.



Each of you:

Listen.

say something beautiful about this world.

say something broken about this world.

Listen.


Something drastic is going to happen.

First to these people. 

Then to this world.




Each of you:

choose one:

Avail, Devon, Jace, Nari, Soryl, Trill and Wyr 


Another:

how you got here

the unseasonable weather

a new technology

a wager

how different things once were

a natural wonder

a work of art


And one more:

flirt because of desire

flirt in spite of desire

ask after a relative's health

ask after a missing guest

reveal a secret

reveal a fear

question another's past decision




Write your choices down.

Make a name tent.



These characters know of one another

They've never met.


They're:

powerful.

self-centered.

polite.

opinionated. 

and well-informed.



Set a timer.

Place it under the table.

Sit for a meal.



Converse, using your choices if you like.

Fragmenting, 
individual exchanges
are ok. 

Silence
is ok.



When the timer beeps, a bomb has killed all present.

Drastic.


But what happens to the world?
