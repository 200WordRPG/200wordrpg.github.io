Three scavengers must cross a nightmarish city to bring supplies back to their colony. They will face perils from without and within.

Each player has 10 check-boxes representing supplies.

On your turn, roll 2d10. Describe a scene for the other two, using indicated prompts:

  ( WITHIN )                   ( WITHOUT )
1. CONFESSION             DARKNESS
2. BETRAYAL                  HEIGHT
3. SACRIFICE                  DEPTH
4. PHOBIA                       REFLECTION
5. MEMORY                     HUNTING
6. SECRET                       TRAP
7. EPIPHANY                   ILLUSION
8. LIE                                SPEED
9. TRUTH                         NOISE
10. INSECURITY             SILENCE      

Cross off prompts when used. If re-rolled, use the next.

In a scene, take turns building on what's described. When peril is imminent, each roll 1d10, and collaboratively resolve the scene using indicated prompts:

1-3: You lose some supplies. Mark off one check-box. If you have none, check another player's.

4-6: You are impaired, but you carry on.

7-9: You narrowly escape the peril.

10: You discover additional supplies. Add a new check-box.

When 9 of each scene prompts have been crossed off, you return to the colony.

Roll 1d10, add remaining supplies, and collaboratively epilogue:

30+: The colony will thrive.
20-30: The colony will survive.
10-20: Not everyone will survive.
<10: The colony will collapse.
