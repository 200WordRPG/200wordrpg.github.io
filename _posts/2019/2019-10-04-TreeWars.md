```
EVERYONE IS A PLAYER. GET CREATIVE AND HELP WITH THE FOLLOWING
CHOOSE OR CREATE A SETTING
CHOOSE OR CREATE A CREATURE
CHOOSE OR CREATE A BIRD. (9 BIRDS MAX)
CHOOSE YOUR CHIRP. YOU CAN ONLY CHIRP. (YOU'RE A BIRD. ACT LIKE ONE)

TAKE TURNS ROLLING 1D6 TO CHIRP. DEPENDING ON THE ROLL, YOU GET PECK COUNTERS (P).
1-2= WEAK CHIRP
3-4 = MEDIUM CHIRP (+1P)
5-6 = LOUD CHIRP (+2P)

ON ROUNDS 3,6,8,9 AND 10, THE CREATURE COMES TO TAKE DOWN THE TREE. IF IT IS NOT STOPPED FOR 2 ROUNDS, THE TREE IS CUT, AND ALL BIRDS LOSE THE GAME.
LEVEL 1 (2-3 BIRDS)- 1(P) TO STOP ROUNDS 1-5, 2(P) ROUNDS 6-10
LEVEL 2 (4-6 BIRDS)-2(P) TO STOP ROUNDS 1-5, 3(P) ROUNDS 6-10
LEVEL 3 (7-9 BIRDS)-3(P) TO STOP ROUNDS 1-5, 4(P) ROUNDS 6-10

YOU CAN SPEND 1(P) EACH ROUND FOR THE FOLLOWING:
STOP THE CREATURE
FORCE ANY BIRD TO RE-ROLL 

AT THE END OF THE LAST ROUND, THE BIRD WITH THE MOST (P) WINS THE GAME. IF TIED, REPEAT ROUNDS 1-3.
