Start a music album, possibly a songwriter's.

Describe your Character with; a Name, one Relation to each other Character, a personal problem, an Aspiration.

The most tired player is the first Turn Player. Starts describing their Aspiration.
If another player LIKES what's hearing, he interrupts narrating the Turn Player's problem by their character POW. Mark that player's Problem.

The TP can now;
Renounce telling and pass turn (mark TP's Aspiration).
Negate the problem (mark the interrupter Name) and keep narrating until another player's interruption.
Ignore the interruption calling the Relation (TP mark their Relation toward that character).
If the TP ends their narration, turns pass to the right. If no interruption happened, TP marks own name x2, other players: mark relation toward TP.

When the album ends, in order:
every aspect of a Character is marked => character suicides.

two players have their respective relationship marked:
one such player mark their Aspiration or Name.
OR both player deletes their Relation.

2 marks on Aspiration => delete Aspiration.

2 marks on Name: => Mark Aspiration or one Relation. 

All players can now delete one mark from their character. Restart the album, narration continues. No Aspiration => Narrate lack of Aspiration.

Game ends at  first suicide.
