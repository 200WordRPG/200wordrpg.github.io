```
Write down your Faction's name and Plan to break free of the Overseer's tyrannical rule. Also write down, "My faction's base is on floor __ of Paradise, but when the Overseer checks the camera feeds for my floor, it Thinks It Sees floor __." Put the same number in both blanks. 

Each turn, you can either Comply, Conspire, or Rewire Cameras. Discuss it, then declare simultaneously.

If you Conspire, gain one Preparation. If you Comply, you are safe. If you Rewire Cameras, pick two Factions. They switch the floor number that the Overseer Thinks It Sees for their floor.

At the end of each turn, everyone who Conspired points to the faction the Overseer Thinks It Sees for their floor. Those faction are raided. If you are raided and didn't Comply this turn, you are Purged. Change your faction's name and Plan. Set your Preparation to zero. 

Once you have 4 Preparation, you enact your Plan. The game ends. The factions with 3 Preparation become the new order. Factions with 2 Preparation are torn apart in the turmoil. Factions with less Preparation are lost to history.

For a longer game, randomly determine if Plans fail. Failed plans get your Faction Purged.

This game was inspired by my day job as a facilities temp, where I answer a lot of calls about offices that are too hot or too cold. I promise there's a connection.
