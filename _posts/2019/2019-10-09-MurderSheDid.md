```
Choose a setting. Somewhere remote.

Everyone invents a character to play.

Each player gives their character a connection with another willing player's character. Daughter, business partner, indebted, lover, fan... Keep going round and adding links until everyone has at least three. These may be secrets but at least two characters must know each one.

Each player writes down one character they want to protect and one they want to go to jail.

One character, chosen randomly, is then murdered by little old lady. The murdered character's player now plays this woman. She likes to "solve" the murders she commits. 

In character, discuss who could have committed the murder. The little old lady can use the facts she learns to accuse someone of the murder. Any player can counter accusations with appropriate facts about the relations between the characters.

When time is up, or all relationships have been revealed, the police arrive and the little old lady explains who did it and why. If no one can counter the accusation the police believe her and she gets away with murder again.

Otherwise the other characters can make their own accusations. The police will believe the most convincing reasoning.
