```
Players: 8-20

Time: 30 minutes 

-Supplies: Name tags

-Theme: You were invited by someone to their "Gander Reveal Party" and assumed it was a typo, until your friend introduced their goose.

-Safety: Cut and Brake.  Players should set limits on Goose behavior.

-Characters: 

*Host*: Host loves everyone at the party and wants them to share their excitement.

*Goose*: Goose hates everyone.  Goose runs around, attacks people, honks, and knocks stuff over. If Host says, "Bad Goose," Goose should act worse.  If Host says "be a good goose," Goose should calm down, but still be bad.

*Friends and family*: You're here to be excited about a new baby.

-Character Creation:

Stand in a circle.  Introduce yourselves, say why you dislike the person to your right. Host likes everyone, Goose likes no one. Do Name Tags.


-Gameplay:

The party starts with Host welcoming everyone and then making a quick exit.  Give people a few minutes before returning and then call for attention.  Say you know why you're all here and then introduce Goose.  Let Goose loose in the room. Use Goose mechanics to help modulate Goose player.  The game ends when Host kicks everyone out of their house.
