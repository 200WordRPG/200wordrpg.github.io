A snake is you.
Each snake has three traits: Blue, Green, and UV, among which they must distribute twelve six-sided dice (minimum two in each and maximum six in any given one).
Blue dice are used for logic and resilience.
Green dice are used for persuasion and agility.
UV dice are used for intuition and force.
When no particular trait is called for, roll Snek, which is equal to your lowest trait +1 die.

When you act and the outcome is in doubt, the Snake Handler will tell you what the TN is for each trait in order to succeed. You must roll at least this many trait die with a value of 3 or less to succeed, unless you roll snake eyes (two or more occurrences of 1, which is an auto-success) Sometimes a particular trait can't be used to succeed on a challenge. TNs follow.
TN	Relative Difficulty
0	Why roll?
1	Easy
2	Moderate
3	Difficult
4	Brow-Furrowing
5	Britches-Chapping
6	Teeth-Breaking
When you are injured or otherwise halted, take 1 die away from the trait you just attempted the roll with. Once you cannot roll a trait due to having no dice in it, you lose.
