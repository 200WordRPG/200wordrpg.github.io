Codeck is a GM-less TTRPG inspired by the world's most popular tactical espionage action video game series. Players take on the roles of a solo operative on a dangerous infiltration mission and their support team who are in radio contact. All roleplay is done via radio conversations.

Each player decides who their character is. Whoever most recently handled a cardboard box takes the first turn.

== Gameplay ==
> Draw a card from a deck of playing cards.
> Make a radio call based on the prompts below. Other players may join in the call (except on private frequencies).
> When the call ends (natural conclusion, or operative hangs up) the next player takes their turn.
> Any amount of mission time may elapse between calls.

== Prompts ==
> Hearts: emotional melodrama.
> Diamonds: the villains' plot.
> Clubs: discuss an obstacle facing the operative.
> Spades: elaborate historical context.
> A-2: make the call on a private frequency.
> 3-5: reveal a secret.
> 6-7: make an analogy to popular culture or philosophy.
> 10: introduce a new character to the radio conversation (take on an additional role).
> J-Q: call immediately before or after a boss fight.
> K: reveal what may happen when the deck is exhausted (end of the game).
