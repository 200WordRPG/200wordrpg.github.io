1-6 players
10-40 minutes

You'll Need
1 six-sided die
Paper
Pens

Safety Tools
Open door
X-card

Monsters outgrow their bodies and need new ones. Some scavenge. Others cocoon. Some find Body Bogs-mires of ooze, body parts, and magic.

One found your Body Bog. It investigated. At last, it waded in.

What body will emerge?

* * * 

You're all playing as one Body Bog. You'll need perception, compassion-and luck-to help this monster. 
 
For each step, go widdershins around the group. Take notes.

1. Name a personality trait you each observed in the monster.

2. Write down an activity, sensation, or emotion it would like. Pass your paper left, unless you're playing solo.

3. Roll the die. 

1: Head
2: Torso
3: Limbs
4: Wings / Fins
5: Tail / Unusual Appendage
6: Whole Body / Magic / Area Effect

Describe what you notice about the new body part and how it'll help the creature experience what's on your paper. Repeat until everyone has gone at least thrice. 

If a body part wasn't rolled, your monster doesn't have it.

4. Draw or write about your monster.

5. Optionally, find your monster a friend at your gathering. Introduce the monster and offer the drawing or description.

I really wanted to create a game that was simple to learn and play, accessible, quick and easy to run in crowded, active places (such as between convention panels/events or while waiting for a group to finish up a game before starting a new one). 

I also loved the idea of a somewhat incompetent but truly caring bog â€” one that has a bunch of different ideas, and can't really prioritize or choose between them. The mechanics are meant to make sure that each game creates a monster that only a bog could love. <3
 
Thanks to April Walsh for helping me play-test this game!
