You are an Explorer. As such, you have a NAME, a ROLE, GOALS, and three stats. 

BODY is physical; climbing, hitting, withstanding hits.

SENSES are accuracy, perception, dexterity.

MIND is knowledge, discernment, magical prowess.

Start with two in each, and add four points between them. Whenever you test your skills, divide your stat in half (rounded down) and roll that many d6. Rolls of 4+ are one success each. One success means it works, but only just, and something goes very wrong. Two successes means it works with minor difficulties. Three successes means it works perfectly. For every roll that ends in no successes, mark one exp. Spend three exp to increase a stat by one.

To help an ally, roll the stat they do. For each of your successes, they roll +1d6.

ROLES and GOALS:
Choose a ROLE for yourself; this is who a
you are and what you do. Some examples include: "Boxer", "Hacker", and "Mage"

Also choose a GOAL for yourself; why you wanted to Explore. Some examples include: "Help People", "Prove Myself", and "Make My Fortune".

That's it! You can use this system for any setting, just fit the ROLES and GOALS to your game!
