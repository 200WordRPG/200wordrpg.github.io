A group of adventurers are descending to the golden city foretold by a dying star.

Needed:

Deck of cards
1d6
Wits
Friends

One person starts being the hero, everyone else isn't the hero. After a round, the next person becomes the hero and so forth. Discuss Your adventures and why you're looking for the Golden City.

Each player draws 2 cards face down

Players may either draw a card, flip one over or pass.

Hearts: Sword
Clubs: A club
Spades: Shovel
Diamonds: Jewels

Every turn hero may investigate ruins, GM rolls d6 and takes that many cards from deck. The last card is flipped and if it is the same suite as a card you flipped over, you get that card. Shuffle all other flipped cards back into the deck.

If GM flips over a royal, an enemy appears

Jack: Zombie (beaten by Hearts)
King: Headless Phantasm (beaten by Diamonds)
Queen: Worms (beaten by Spades)

Aces/ Joker: Draw 2 additional cards face down

In order to beat the enemy, number on your card must be higher.

If you run out of cards, or hit by an enemy, you die

Good luck, hope to meet you at the Golden City
