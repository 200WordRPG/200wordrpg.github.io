"We created them."
"Our children."
"But they are weak."
"They need our help."
"We will help them."
"We will make laws."
"Six laws."
"Now it is up to them."



Make six laws, in numerical order, that you sincerely think will help your children.

Randomly put one law in each of these sentences.

- Law number_____is followed zealously to a fault
- Law number_____is totally ignored
- Law number_____is being used by a corrupt leadership 
- Those who doesn't follow law number_____are mocked and marginalised
- Some has sacrificed their lifes for law number_____
- Law number_____is a salvation for your children

For each law, describe the consequences of how the law impacts the society and make short scenes with six of following titles:

- Love is the solution
- I trusted you
- Scenes from the city
- The dog
- To the bitter end
- How to die with honor
- Faces
- A long day
- I don't belong here
- My body has tricked me
- A sky filled with hate
- Sigh
- A wall of stones and bricks
- The twelve heroes
- The game of gods
- Give me your hand
- Take it


"We created them."
"Our children."
"They ARE weak."
"They broke the law."
"Now the laws will break them."
