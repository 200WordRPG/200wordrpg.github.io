SETUP
Requires major+minor tarot deck and 2+ players. Separate major from minor and shuffle each well, then rotate half of each 180 then shuffle well. Use tarot reading guide for meanings.

CORE
Draw two major arcana each. These anchor characters. Who they are and what they face/want. Lay one minor arcana face down before each character. These are Epilogues. Describe characters and setting, drawing cards for inspiration. Characters take turns describing their actions in pursuing their ends. When luck would affect the outcome of an action, draw a minor arcana. This is your fate. If it is upright you describe the outcome using the card's reading. If it is inverted somebody else describes the outcome using that reading. Once only you may play a card as if you drew it the other way up but it then replaces your epilogue as it was drawn. Rock paper scissors for PvP. Each player draw a card to help describe why they succeeded or failed. Play until the deck is finished. Then players take turns flipping their epilogues. Upright, you get what you want, Inverted, you don't. Use the reading to describe why your character succeeded or failed.

Massive thanks to everybody in Waypoint's tabletop channel for being so nice. 

Here's a link to Ego, a (WIP) hack for this game to make it about selfish teens being emotionally irresponsible (cw: abusive relationships, shitty people, emotional disfunction) https://docs.google.com/document/d/168_n7i7gPCWMPIdTuNtn_1nrK6V9ky2-Afyt13xsRSc/edit?usp=drivesdk
