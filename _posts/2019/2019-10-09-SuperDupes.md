To make your super, you gotta give:

-a secret identity (the man/woman/attack helicopter behind the mask)

-Some powers (being God, literally or otherwise, doesn't count)

-Something to power you up in your hour of need.  That's your spinach
-Something to be your kryptonite (spinach on opposite day)
Power level (starts at 3)

Gameplay:
     When it's time to use your powers, roll [power level] d6s and assign any three to the following statements:
     [ ] I did the thing
     [ ] Nobody got hurt
     [ ] Nothing got broken
1-3s bad (player describes how) but pay 1 experience, 4-6s good.  

Got spinach? Get a reroll!  
Got? kryptonite? DM rerolls for you.
Spinach and keeping cancel each other out in their mutual emnity.

     Now if everything goes wrong, you lose a power level.  Got none? you're done.


Spending that sweet XP after session:
     1 XP- Change your superhero name... and maybe your custome while you're at it

     2 XP- Find a new spinach.

     3 XP- up that power level.

     4 XP- Find a new kryptonite.

     10 XP- actually retire.  Peace out!
