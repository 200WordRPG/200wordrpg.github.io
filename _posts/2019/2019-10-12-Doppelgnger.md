Doppelgänger is a game that is played while you do other things with your group, like going out or during game night. 


You are a colony of shapeshifting creatures preparing to first take over the town and then, the world. You need to practice your impersonation skills to pass as different humans, but if you adopt too many of your target's mannerisms and personality you'll get lost in the act and won't be able to shapeshift out of it. 


The objective of the game is to lightly act as your real self. You already look like them, but now you have to imitate a mild version of yourself. If you do something that the colony deems as being too much as your real self, you'll lose.

You can prepare something to counteract this too faithful of an imitation. Hide an object in your pockets that you'd never use, wear some unseen clothing that is the opposite of your style... However, you can only have one safeguard; if you fail again you'll lose definitely.


You can add weird creature-like demeanors here and there for flavor and fun. The winners are those who remain in play at the end of the session.
