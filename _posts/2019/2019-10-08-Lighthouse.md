Describe your isolation. Where are you? What forces you to stay? Why do you desire to leave? What do you think will happen if you fail to maintain the lighthouse? What forces you to explore?

Get into your character. Make choices based on what you know, flesh it out through play. If your chosen action isn't easily achievable, role a six sided die. Do this often.

Have you rolled this number before? No, write down the number, next to that write a vague word a twist on the results of your action. Each player will wind up with their own unique pool of twists.

Have you rolled this number before? Yes, use the twist already written.

How does the twist affect the results of your action? Resolve as you see fit, perhaps with a cost.

Your sixth twist will always be lighthouse.

You encounter a force in your work or exploration. The force is other and has its own desires. When the force acts upon its desires resolve things as before with the dice using the same pool of twists as the player the force is interacting with.

What actually happens when the lighthouse goes out?

What happens to you?
