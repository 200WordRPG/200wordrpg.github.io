This accepts at least three participants.

All of the participants will read rules separately before play.

Participants will not discuss rules before play or during play.

All participants are reading different rules.

Participants should know that we cannot be trusted.

One of your number is a ghost.

One of your number killed them.

No one knows who was killed and who did the killing.

Did you do it?

Tell us.

One of your number killed you.

Do not let the others know that you are a ghost.

Who are you?

Tell us.

How do you know the others?

Tell us.

Where are you?

Tell us.

What were the last twenty words you said?

Tell us.

These words are all you can say.

Do not let the others know that you are a ghost.

Why?

You must find your killer.

You must kill your killer.

Why?

Tell us.

Trust nothing.
