Vvvvzzzzwhomp.

You have been materialized on this plane by The Coordinator, to delay The Great Calm.

Your attributes are MIND, BODY, and SOUL, each beginning at 2d6.
Choose something you can do using your best attribute that no one else in the cosmos can do.

Roll 1d6, 2d6, or 3d6 under the relevant attribute to attempt something easy, challenging, or extreme.

You have HP equal to BODY; attacks deal 1d6 damage and always hit.
Roll 2d6 under MIND to act first in a scramble.
When a hit takes you below zero HP, roll 3d6 under SOUL or cease to exist.

You may repurpose a captured artifact from The Calm into a single-use reality spike that guarantees success at a specific activity; decide what that activity is when you construct it.

Whenever you thwart a Lieutenant of The Calm, reduce your best attribute by 1.
Whenever you succumb to temptation, increase your best attribute by 1.

If you succeed in your mission, you cease to exist.
If you fail in your mission, everyone else ceases to exist.

When you cease to exist, make a wish.
Occasionally, wishes are granted.
