Gather 3-4 players, then read aloud:

---------------------------

This is a story about a group of very special creatures who once lived on a tiny floating island in the middle of a vast ocean.

We portray these creatures - and this island has been the home of our kin for countless generations.

Even though we are very different from one another we are family - and we love each other.

---------------------------

One player begins by choosing a scene:

[ ] An everyday situation.
[ ] Sharing a good meal.
[ ] Making a furry friend.
[ ] Seeing something spectacular.
[ ] Seeing something on the horizon.
[ ] Signs of an approaching natural disaster.

Set the scene and say who else is there as it happens.

After each scene, cross it off the list - then continue to the next player.

During your scene your character should clearly perform at least one of the following:

* Share a memory or tell story of the past.
* Be kind, loving, or caring.
* Casually adapt to a new situation.
* Enjoy the small things in life.

When the last scene has been crossed off, the story ends. Read aloud:

---------------------------

That was all a very long time ago and the island has long since sunken into the blue.

I wanted to create a feelgood roleplaying game capturing the mood of Tove Janssonâ€™s Moomin books. 

Her characters are small, moderately intelligent beings who most often face rapid and overwhelming change. To me, what is special about them is their way to deal with that change: No matter what, they take care of each other (as well as others!), and make the most out of every situation - having an overall pleasant time.
