Players are sprites tasked to shape a young world.
Players and DM take tarot sets and split them into major and minor arcana and shuffle.

Stats:
distribute: 1,2,3,3
*create&shape-wands
*destroy&reduce-swords
* communicate&influence-coins
*life&resistance-cups

checks 
Choose apropriate skill and draw cards accordingly from lower arkana and add values together,
if card-suit matches skill, value doubles 
if sum matches value on major arkana card from DM=success
if exactly 2 show the same suit=crit
if other player supports, add half  of other player's card suit-value rounded down.
If DM performs check, either use card suit-value or draw a storyline-appropriate amount of cards.
If player loses, a different approach must be used.


GM uses major arkana-cards to tell the story, one at a time. If a player resolves a card(=situation) with a critical skill check, GM awards said card to player.
GM can add additional cards to introduce adversaries and complications.

Players can use card amount equal to skill rating to raise skill, or can use card to SWAY story, by using card as inspiration to change course of story, but player can only add to GM's story.

Keep going until deck is empty or the story is told.

Huge thanks to John Harper for writing Blades in the Dark and showing me, that players can have story-telling authority too.
Also thanks to Jonathan Tweet, for infecting my brain with the idea, that cards can be used to tell amazing stories
