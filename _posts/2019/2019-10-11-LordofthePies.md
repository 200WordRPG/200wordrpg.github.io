Prompt: You and the other players are stranded on a desserted Island, with the whole island being edible, from the animals to the streams and must find a way to survive the rest of your life in the island.   
Objective: Survive on a desserted island.
Rules: 
1. Pick one person to be the genie/all knowing person/wizard.
2. You and your party members have three wishes each to ask the genie wizard.  These wishes have to be used to acquire ways of eating the food, creating shelter, or acquiring status on the island, but cannot be used to escape the island. The genie wizard can also deny any wishes he deems against the rules.  Any denied wish does not count against a players' wish total.
3. You may discuss with the other survivors about how to use each other's wishes to be the most advantageous for the group.
4. After each party member has used up their wishes, the party gets fifteen minutes to discuss their plan of action using there granted wishes.  The party will then share their plan with the genie wizard who will decide if the plan will work or not.
