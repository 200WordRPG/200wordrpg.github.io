```
The globe warmed. The ocean invaded your city and its people fled, but you could or would not follow them. You surf the waves atop its sunken streets to survive.

The Fibonacci Sequence tracks your Will to Live. You start at 0.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

When the tsunami comes you abandon your crumbling home and take to the skyscraper-gridded waterways, roll (1d6 x 10) + 1d6 to surf for your life. If you roll lower than your current Will, the tsunami consumes you and your board. 

Survival is pain. If you survive a tsunami, advance your Sequence by 4 steps. Start the game with a tsunami.

Between tsunamis, you strain to establish a home. After each of the following acts, roll 1d6. On a 6, another tsunami ravages the city.

If you selflessly comfort another survivor, advance your Sequence by 1 step and retreat theirs by 1.

If you search for meaning, roll 1d6. On a 2 or lower, you find something of beauty and retreat your Sequence by 1. On a 3 or higher, you find something of stabbing nostalgia and loss and advance your Sequence by 1.
