These aliens look like hats and control the humans wearing them. They want to take over. The players are under their control.

You'll need some variety of hats (one per player), index cards, pins, pens.
Give each player 4 cards. On two, they write personality traits (like impulsive, cautious, joyous, grumpy, awkward). On the other two, write skills (like acrobatics, pediatrics, romance novelist, rocket science).

Shuffle personality traits and pin two to each hat. Shuffle skills and pin two to each player. Each player puts on a random hat. The hats invaded and took over a group of humans.

Players exhibit their hat's personality traits. Some hats have accents or mannerisms. These traits follow the hats (the hats are the characters). A player (and the hat controlling them) always has access to their skills.

Negotiate the best combination of personalities and skills for global domination. Argue. Plot. Plan. Trade hats. Try various combinations.

Human subjects experience confusion for a few seconds after a hat is removed. Negotiations end immediately if one of the subjects escapes or all hats agree to their current assignment.

How does each hat contribute to the invasion? How successful was the invasion as a whole?
