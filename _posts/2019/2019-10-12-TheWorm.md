This is it, the culmination of years of research in "anthropological study of 20th century dance", and finally, you and you alone have scoured the fossil record, remaining written documentation, fragments of "YouTube" videos and have finally discovered the true form of an ancient dance known as simply "The Worm".

Except, somehow, other scholars landed on the same subject matter and the damned conference has arranged a live peer review. Only one of you can go on to wow the scientific world with your transformational discovery.

Oldest player goes first.

i. Stand in front of the other players. They should be seated, with notebooks, and stern looks.

ii. Describe in detail how you came to this discovery. The research you did and how you placed each piece into the larger puzzle. Use jargon to convince them you know what you are talking about.

iii. Demonstrate "The Worm" as your reconstruction supposes it must be. It's ok to be stiff or without rhythm, you're an academic.

iv. The other players will write down review scores for "Supporting Evidence", "Compelling Case", "Convincing Demonstration"

When everyone has presented, the best reviewed presentation wins. As best you know, that dance is "The Worm".
