You thought it was over; the proverbial bar fight adventure hook done and dusted or successfully avoided, and you were on you way to new adventures. Except, as you exit the bar, there they are, waiting for you. Perhaps they slipped around the back when you weren't watching, or they are reinforcements summoned by magic (or by the noise). Whatever the reason, they now bar your way.

This narrative driven RPG uses the game Pick Up Sticks as its mechanic. As each PC's action is declared, the GM decides how difficult that action is to achieve, from easy to nigh-on impossible, and assigns to it a coloured stick: yellow, blue, red, green, or black. The player must successfully draw a stick of that colour from the stick-pile without moving any other stick for the task to succeed. Players also draw a stick for actions made against them and/or their corresponding reaction (such as dodging a punch - a failed stick-pull would mean the punch lands or the dodge fails). The game ends when the fight is diffused or one party is unconscious (or worse) and (finally) the next adventure can begin.
