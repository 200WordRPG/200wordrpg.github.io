```
Each player selects an everyday item - a pen, a coin, a shoe - that they have to hand.

Players take turns revealing their item to the group. For each item, the other players act as if they have never seen such an item before and, with great bemusement, question its use and origin.

The owner of the item maintains that it is a common object in everyday use, as the rest improvise and corroborate a parallel universe where it would be nonsensical or impractical for such items to exist.

For example, if the item were a banknote, the parallel universe could be one where there is no such thing as cash, or there is no such thing as paper, or the entire concept of money does not exist. Meanwhile, the owner of the banknote is absolutely certain that it is a normal everyday object, and cannot understand why the others do not recognise it.

Turns end when creativity begins to wane. The game continues until all players have had a chance to present their item. The group must do its best to maintain the coherence of the parallel universe as it becomes increasingly outlandish with every additional object excluded.
