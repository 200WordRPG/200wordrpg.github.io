Winter rages. The colony is dying. Your party has volunteered to save Spring.
Materials: 
	Markers, 
	Tokens, 
	Bag, 
	Paper.
Each player describes their mouse. (Name, appearance, home, deeds)
The Elder(GM) gives each mouse a title, scarf, and 1 to 3 gifts.
	Cut paper into strips. Mark each strip into 8 boxes. 
	In 1 box each the Elder(GM) writes any gifts, then the character's name + title. 
	The remaining boxes are colored by the player as their scarf. 
	Each player and Elder uniquely mark 1 token - placing them in the bag with 1 blank.

Players work alone or together to perform "Deeds." (Elder can set constraints)
	Draw 1 token, 
		if blank or matching any player involved - Success. 
		Otherwise fail. 
Players face "Peril" from winter, predators, and extreme failures.
	Draw a token from the bag
		If token matches:
			Player involved in "Peril" - That player tears a box off their scarf
				or perishes if no more scarf is left.
			Elder - Elder chooses from involved players.
		Otherwise nothing.
Return tokens after each draw
Pertinent Gifts and Titles allow involved players 1 redraw per "Deed" / "Peril".
Gifts cannot be exchanged or lost.
The Elder(GM) describes each "Deed" / "Peril" and constructs the narrative.

This game is dedicated to my wife, who's love of all things small and adorable knows no end.   Also, special thanks to Professor Hutchings for introducing me to this challenge.
