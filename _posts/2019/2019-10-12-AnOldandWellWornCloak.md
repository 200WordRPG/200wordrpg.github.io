You will need 3-5 players, paper, pencil, eraser, and dice.

Draw a simple cloak. From the group, choose a wearer and an illustrator. Everyone else is the chorus.

The illustrator rolls a prompt, and alters the cloak's drawing accordingly. Afterwards, the chorus answers the first question, and the wearer the second. Choose a chorus member to be the next illustrator, and keep going. 

1: ADDITION. 
 - What purpose do the additions serve? 
 - Why were the changes needed? 

2: DAMAGE.
 - How was the cloak damaged?
 - Does this change the cloak's use?

3: WEAR & TEAR.
 - How has the cloak endured strain over time?
 - What stresses have been put upon the cloak?

4: AESTHETICS. 
 - Why was the cloak's appearance altered? 
 - How does the wearer now perceive themselves?

5: RECORD. 
 - Who marked the cloak?
 - Does the wearer know of this record?

6: INHERITANCE. 
 - How did the wearer part from their cloak? 
 - Who is the new wearer?

When INHERITANCE is rolled, the old wearer chooses a new wearer from the chorus, and then becomes the next illustrator. 

After every player has worn the cloak, the game is over. 

Note: this doesn't be played with a cloak. Try a sword, a crown, or a hand.
