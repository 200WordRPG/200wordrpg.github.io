```
* 3-5 players.
* Playing cards.

------------------------------

The Behemoth has laid waste to the world. All will soon be lost - unless you can vanquish the beast.

------------------------------

Decide on a setting.

You sit together, the calm before the storm. Share stories - one per player and topic:

* The Behemoth.
* Something lost.
* Something you can still save.
* A shared experience.
* The future you hope for.

Keep your stories short, but don't fear silence.

Draw a card after each story you tell - for your eyes only. When you have five cards each, you go to face The Behemoth together. 

Draw two cards from the deck. Total them - this is the ADVERSITY. Jacks = 11, Queens = 12, Kings = 13, Aces = 14. 

To STRIKE, overcome the ADVERSITY with your cards. Someone picks a card from their hand and puts it face up. The suit determines your manner - describe your attempt.

HEARTS       Courage
SPADES       Power
DIAMONDS     Wisdom
CLUBS        Luck

Anyone can add more cards. Describe how each card contributes to the STRIKE. If you cannot overcome the ADVERSITY, someone SACRIFICES themselves to STRIKE. Describe how.

After a STRIKE, discard used cards. Draw another ADVERSITY. 

To vanquish The Behemoth, perform one STRIKE more than there are players. Otherwise, you have failed.

## Author Comments
I wanted to make a short atmospheric game about fearlessness, sacrifice and hope.

It’s influenced by Ben Robbin’s Follow and Jason Morningstar’s The Last Stand.

This game would not have been written if not for the 200 Word RPG Challenge.
