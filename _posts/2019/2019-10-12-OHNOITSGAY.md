OH NO, IT'S GAY!
a game for two or more

You are gay. They are cute.
It's a problem, for some reason. Decide why.

You each have a pile of six-sided dice.
Each player's dice should be of a single unique color.

RULES FOR TWO OR THREE:
Start flirting. Maybe you're roleplaying. Maybe it's real life. Who knows.
When a player's flirting has its intended effect on you, stack one of your dice. All dice are stacked in the center of the table in a single column, each player adding their own on top of the others. Be careful ... or don't?
When the dice stack falls, the last to add a die must confess their feelings to the other player(s), who may of course react however they like.

RULES FOR MORE THAN THREE:
Each player keeps their own stack of dice.
Each player still has their own color, but when a player flirts successfully, one of their dice is taken and added to that player's stack. When a stack falls, the player must confess their feelings to either the person who had the most dice in the fallen stack, or to the person whose die was added last.

## Author Comments
this is a slightly edited version of a one-page game available here:
https://fencedforest.itch.io/oh-no-its-gay

it is inspired by the mechanics of Epidiah Ravachol's Dread and Alex Roberts' Star Crossed, by the anxiety of nonmonogamous romantic feelings undeclared, and by the excitement and compersion of watching a new group of friends slowly pair off, taking you with them.
