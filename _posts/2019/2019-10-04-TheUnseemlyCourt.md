Seelie Court fae inhabiting the woods are treated with wary reverence; not so with the Faecetiae of the Unseemly Court, who hide pornographic magazines in the woods. Their power waned as the internet spread, and their domain is on the edge of destruction. Faecetiae must get their hands dirty to avert a crisis.

Safety

Don't play this game.

Play

Each player purchases the raunchiest magazine they can find. The character of the magazine should inform the player's fae character and name. 

Celebrate a seasonal feast. Brag about magazines and the corruption they engender.

Each fae hides their magazine in the woods; other fae watch and verify. Vote; whoever hid best wins ties for Monarch election.

Wait two weeks. A fae geas prevents talking about or touching the magazines.

Find magazines and tally points:

Untouched: 0
Missing: 1
Clearly disturbed: 3
Undeniable evidence of use: 5

Average total points determine fate of the realm: 

<1: Complete destruction
1+: Hardscrabble existence
2+: Rejuvenation and grudging respect
3+: New Golden Age

Reconvene for another feast. Celebrate per results. Reckon with consequences; celebrate the future or watch the world burn. 

Character with highest score becomes Monarch. Give a speech; end feast at your whim.
