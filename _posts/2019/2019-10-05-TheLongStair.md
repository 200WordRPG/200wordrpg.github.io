Our world has ended.

To repair the disparate strands, gather:

]__  A special Token.
     ]__  An illustrated Tarot Deck.
          ]__  And three Perspectives.

Each Perspective claims an aspect of The Wanderer:

Past (Before the End) / Present (In the Wasteland) / Future (Upon The Long Stair)

As we rediscover: Our Origins / Our Self / Ourselves.

Prepare the cards.

Major Arcana embody the Obstacles in our path.

Minor Arcana are the People / Places / Things that spur us on.

Separate and shuffle the two decks.

Each Perspective draws an Obstacle. Place it face up in a staggered row, like steps.

The first of three Flights.

Each poses a question.
 
]__  How did the world end?
     ]__  Who have we become?
          ]__  What might we hold on to?

These are but examples. Let them inspire you.

Art / Text / Subtext

Claim the Token to set a scene exploring your Obstacle.

When the time is right, turn a Minor Arcana face up. Give it life.

Accept it to Bridge Past to Present to Future to ...

Pass or claim the Token to explore another Perspective.

Become an advocate for their Obstacle. Become a force for growth.

Paint The Wanderer in three voices.

]__  Bridge the cards.
     ]__  Draw the next Flight.
          ]__  Discover yourself.

Then fade to black.

Two hundred steps. Endless iterations. The Long Stair is a paired down iteration of an idea that's been haunting me for ages, now realized.

The further we descend the more entangled we become.
