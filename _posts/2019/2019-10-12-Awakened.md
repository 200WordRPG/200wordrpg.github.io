The earth is dying. The oceans are boiling. Life is out of options. 

And so, you have awakened.

All of you will, as a group or in turn, describe what you are. You need not be the same.

Then you will describe why and how you will save the planet. How do you come together as one?

You will set out tasks, goals, challenges. What must you overcome?

As you tell this story, and embody your awakened, there will be times when it's unclear whether or not you can do something. In those moments, you'll draw one card from a single, shuffled deck. 
 
Ace: No, and / You don't do it, and something even worse happens.
2-4: No, but / You don't do it, but somehow you're helped forward
5-8: Yes, but / You do it, but you're worse for wear
9-Jack: You do it.
Queen, King. Yes, and / It goes even better than you'd imagined.

Odds are better when you work together. If working together on an action, you each draw a card, and the highest determines the result above.

Your story ends when the planet is saved, or when all is lost.
