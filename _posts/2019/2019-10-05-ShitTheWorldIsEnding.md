<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Ideally you should have 1 week set aside before playing because the game starts as soon as you begin reading the rules- this is to prevent over preparing for the game and taking all of the fun out of it. This is a game about being resourceful with what you have. *The author is not responsible for any damages, injuries, or deaths caused by playing this game. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>

Your phone starts blaring an alarm... Annnnnd BOOM! You just got an alert saying the world ends in one hour! You have that time, starting right this instant, to gather and prepare food, water, and other supplies.

At the end of that hour, you no longer have conventional electricity, running water, or access to networks/infrastructure. If you have to leave to get more supplies and are not back within that hour, you are presumed dead.

Over the next week, you have to ration those few supplies you saved.

The game ends in one week or when you/all players give up.

"Giving up" signifies death.

You lose if you die before the week is up.
