a para-roleplaying game,
destroy your friends,
in real life,
with black magic!
A 'game' for two or more 'friends'
  
Our players, the Delirious Witches, will actually perform black magic rituals and spells of their own devisal in attempts to curse each other and to discover their own latent magical abilities. Out of courtesy the Witches will let their cursee know what ritual has been performed and what it's effect will be. Fortunately, this allows counter-rituals to be done to negate the curse. 
This is not a letter writing game, magic must be performed for the game to work. Increase the efficacy of your curses through progressively elaborate ritual and esoteric research. There will be an effect - even if unintentional. 

Example messages-  
"I have blackened a needle in candle-flame and thought of you meeting a spiteful stranger"
"I have stared into a dark mirror till my face became a spirit's, I told him of you, expect nightmares"
"I walked through the woods at night singing your name, all the creatures that lurk and crawl in the forest know you now"

The game ends when one Witch is too spooked, or both Witches become truly delirious and a truce is agreed.

I've always had a interest in the paranormal and in magic. It's a guilty pleasure, I'll pretend to do magic. I'll cavort around in the dark looking for ghosts in mirrors, all sorts of weird junk that I wouldn't want anyone to know about. I want you to 'pretend' to do magic as well. The game can be played positively, using magic to send your fellow 'players' good things... but where is the fun in that?
