Play the dream alone
Play with the music you need

Amid the turbulent life of the commune, you find a moment of peace. You close your eyes and as so often, your dream takes you to the dead.

Choose 2: what of yours enters the dream with you?
an emotion, a treasure, a burden, a conviction

Choose 2: how does their realm present itself?
in Nature, desolate, majestic, crowded, vast, urban, beautiful, ruined

Choose 2: what form do the dead take?
human, natural, hidden, ceremonial, frightening, wonderful

To stay in the dream, draw a card and narrate according to its prompt. The cards number indicates the prompt, its symbol the emotion to color narration with.

Heart 	-	Tenderness
Tile	-	Excitement
Clover	-	Sadness
Pikes	-	Anger

7 	-	A promise given
8 	-	Something is taken
9 	-	A memory shared
10 	-	A regret surfaces, actions follow
Jack	-	Someone recognized
Queen 	-	A realization shrouded in silence
King 	-	A ritual they remember
Ace 	-  	The dream changes dramatically. Choose two new ways the realm presents itself. The next card with the same symbol as this card ends the dream.

How do you carry on after waking up?
