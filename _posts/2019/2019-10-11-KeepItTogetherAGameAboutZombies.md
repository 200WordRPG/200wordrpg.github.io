               You are zombies. Start with all LIMBS unless you choose otherwise.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slot #     |   Limb         |      Actions                                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.         |   Head         |      Communication, Noticing, Cleverness, **Biting**      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.         |   Arm          |      Dexterity, **Crawling**                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.         |   Second Arm   |      Lugging                                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.         |   Leg          |      Jumping, **Jump Scares**                             |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.         |   Second Leg   |      Stealth, **Running**                                 |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.         |   Fun Bits     |      Intimate Moments, Wacky Powers, **Creeping Out**     |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To perform ACTIONS, roll 1d8 using the appropriate LIMB'S # as TARGET (starred ACTIONS: +1 to TARGET per missing LIMB). If lacking appropriate LIMB, roll damage first ("Second Arm/Leg" ACTIONS require two arms/legs).
 
Rolling TARGET or lower = success. Upon failing, roll damage.

Roll damage using 1d6. If you have an appendage there, it's destroyed. If not, die. Revive at the end of the scene if another player survived/used a VICTIM.

After every scene you don't die in, do one:

- Scavenge THREAD or random LIMB

- Infect: must have bitten a human this scene. Upon death, you may live on as your VICTIM instead.

- Repair someone: spend one THREAD to attach one LIMB anywhere one's missing, even the "wrong" slot. Use the slot you attached it to when rolling damage, but that LIMB'S normal # for attempting ACTIONS. New Fun Bits can be anything: genitalia, chainsaws, backpacks.

## Author Comments
Several months ago, I watched an episode of Being Human featuring a zombie who refused to believe she was dead, even as her body started to break down and fall apart with increasingly alarming frequency. While the macabre humor of her situation was what initially grabbed me, it was the sheer personal horror of remaining impossibly sentient and impossibly alive while feeling your body and your world die all around you that kept me up at night and, eventually, drove me to word-vomit into a Notes file what would eventually become Keep It Together.

This game was a collaboration between me and my steadfast TTRPG-crafting partner in crime, Antonin Fusco. You can find him on Twitter @the1trueunicorn. In addition to my website (linked above), you can also find me on Twitter @SeawardEyes. Thank you so much to Alison Gondek, Nicholas Erickson, and all of our Discord server friends for both giving us valuable feedback and cheering us on. We couldn't have made this happen without you.
