```
You are hunted

When you glimpse the visage of your predator, write its name on your paper
When you are harmed, tear off a bit of your paper

        No paper
            no blood
                        death

            Muddled paper
                no sanity
                            madness

When you encounter challenge, roll your three dice on your paper

An eleven succeeds
Dice on the paper are counted

You are good at one, bad at another and gain or lose a die in context:

    scrambling

            struggling


                        interpreting

When you are bleeding, roll 
patch on some torn paper
When you want to clear your head, roll
erase that many letters
                            but will you be caught in invigilance?


Steal a car; grab a brick; brandish a cross; flee to sunlight; plead;
                                        did it help?

A revision of my 2018 submission, CLIMB the SPIRE, which - to my chagrin - I made about a day too late, and have been waiting a year and some change to submit.
