```
Players:

Create a robot.

Divide twenty points into its Legs, Arms, Torso and Head. (minimum 1, maximum 5)

You have two legs and arms by default and you need to divide points separately into both.

Choose one module per location. Modules allow for subtle changes to rules: attacking with a location other than arms, attacking at range, etc.

Your Defence is equal to your current total in your Legs locations.

Name your Robot.

Fight:

When you attack roll 1d6+current total in Arms. If you roll equal to or higher than your opponent's Defence, you hit.

Roll 1d6 to determine hit location.
1. Left leg
2. Right leg
3. Left arm
4. Right arm
5. Torso
6. Head

By default, Robots can only punch. This can be changed with modules like weapons.

Attacks deal 1d6 damage. Deduct damage from appropriate location. If Head is brought to zero, your defence is halved and you must roll 2d6 to attack and use the lower. If Torso is brought to zero, your robot is destroyed.

GM:

Populate your world with robots for your players to fight and give them a reason to fight them.

Chew the scenery.

Hack.
