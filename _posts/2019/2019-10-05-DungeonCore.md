You are elemental spirits, subservient to a Dungeon Core (DC).  DCs use and consume Mana exclusively gathered from the environment and adventurers inside their Territory.
Players control traps and monsters, and the GM controls invaders.
Together, design a labyrinthian Dungeon with treasure, monsters, and traps to attract and kill adventurers!  Keep expanding to attract stronger adventurers, but be careful - too challenging or too stingy, and they may stop coming!

Mana gains:
Event                 Gain
Ambient               1/hour
Adventurer present    3/hour/Adventurer
Adventurer dies       60 + 1/5 stat points

Sample Mana costs:
Item                                 Cost
Build 5Ã—5 space                      2
1GP-worth of treasure                0.5
Trap                                 1 per stat point (choose only 1 stat)
Monster                              0.25 per stat point
Increase Territory radius            1/foot
Change w/Adventurers in Territory    x10

Adventurer/Monster stats:
Brawn*
Cunning*
Agility* (defends against Agility)
Mana* (magical attacks)
Physical Resistance (defends against Brawn)
Magical Resistance (defends against Mana)
Health^
* also a Trap stat.
^ Health = 6 + Brawn

Newbie Adventures have 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 to distribute among their stats.
Stats depict the number of d6 you roll.  Damage = Attacker's Dice minus Defender's.
Items add directly to stats (shortsword = +1 Brawn).
Traps reset automatically.  Monsters must be re-summoned.
