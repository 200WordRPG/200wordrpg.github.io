Do you like rolling tons of dice? Do you build dice towers, waiting for your turn in tabletop RPGs? Do you own a giant sack of dice? What if there was a way to make a game of that? 

In this game, each player is an intrepid explorer, researching the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This tower has many floors, and you discover that each floor is actually a battle arena. Can you fight all the way to the top?

Roll a 'handful of dice' to determine the number of floors. Each floor is a boss fight. 

This game uses dice towers. To determine damage dealt, the player builds a tower made of assorted dice. Once that tower falls, the players collect the dice used and roll those to determine their damage. 

Objective: See how many bosses you can beat. No healing between floors. 
Boss Health: Each player (including GM) builds a dice tower and adds everything together.
Player Health: Some arbitrarily large number.  Like 10,000 + a player-made dice tower.

To save time, build your dice towers at the same time. GM builds one for the boss.

Keep scoreboard for tallest tower and most damage dealt!

Maybe use a tray ... cool.
