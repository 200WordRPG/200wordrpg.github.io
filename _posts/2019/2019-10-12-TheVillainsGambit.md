"But who prays for the Villain?"

- Any # Players
- 1 Deck of Cards

1. Choose a Villain, everyone else is a Fate. Villain creatively describes identity.
2. Fates are dealt first card, representing their Encounter.
3. Fates reveal Encounters and describe creatively (see table).
4. Fates are dealt second card face-up, representing Strength (Strength = card's value).

5. Villain is dealt 3 cards and faces the first Fate (clockwise).
6. Villain chooses and reveals 1 Method Card, 1 Strength Card, discards the third.
7. Villain wins if their chosen Strength card >= Fate's strength.
8. Villain gives creative description of victory or defeat.
9. Repeat steps 5-8 for every Fate.
