```
Requirements:
Up to 4 Players, 4 Coins per Player
A D8

The Players are of the Angelic Host, trying to guide a Mortal towards their Spheres of Influence.

The Storyteller will begin by breathing life and identity to our Mortal, The Hosts will each give 3 characteristics to his environment and pick one or two Spheres depending on player count, These being:

Justice
Redemption
Damnation
Indulgence

The Hosts cannot directly influence the Mortal, but at any point during the game, the hosts may cause events or minor miracles to happen around them, To guide the Mortal

Roll a d8
1-2 The Host loses a Coin or an Influence
3- 4 Flip a coin, Mortal Gains 1 Influence if Heads, none if Tails
5- 6 Mortal gains 1 Influence
7-8 Mortal gains 1 Influence, Flip a Coin to remove a conflicting Influence on heads.

The opposing Host may, at any point give you 1 of their Coins to completely cancel your influence, or to twist the event you have caused to suit their Sphere.

The game ends when a single Host holds all the Coins, or the mortal has gained 5 Influences of a given type.

First time participating in this, The game itself is kinda vague but i think it serves its purpose as a "competitive storytelling" kind of deal for the time being. might revisit the idea in the future
