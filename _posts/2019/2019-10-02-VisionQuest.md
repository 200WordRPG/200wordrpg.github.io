A domino based two-player cooperative RPG about searching for meaning during a crisis. 

Tools: 
     >Set of dominoes placed face-down with doubles removed. 

Players: 
     >A Character facing a specific crisis
     >The Quest 

The Character draws and blindly places one domino (two at the start) at the end of the line. The Quest describes the scene/transition. The Character describes the action of the scene; how they respond and how the scene resolves. Both should involve their partner, asking them for details.

Narrative Cues: 
     The first side of a domino is the Impact, the second the Path.
     Compare the new impact to the previous Path. 

         Impact =< Path: Scene is pessimistic

          |  ()  ()  |    ()   |        |    ()    |          |          
          |  ()  ()  |      () |        |           |      () |           
          '-----------'---------'       '-----------'---------'         
                                    or

          |  ()  ()  |    ()   |        |    ()    |          |          
          |  ()  ()  |      () |        |      ()  |      () |           
          '-----------'---------'       '-----------'---------'        

         Impact > Path: Scene is optimistic
          .----------.---------.        .----------.---------.   
          |  ()  ()  | ()      |        |  ()  ()  | ()      |      
          |  ()  ()  |    ()   |        |           |          |          
          |  ()  ()  |      () |        |  ()  ()  |      () |           
          '-----------'---------'       '-----------'---------'         

     The difference between the new Impact and Path describes the severity/impact of the scene

     The new Path provides narrative direction:
          One: Isolation, confidence, hope
          Two: Betrayal, companionship, choice
          Three: Linearity, travel, transition
          Four: Stagnation, balance, revolution
          Five: Entrapment, focus, discovery
          Six: Crowding, abundance, unity

     When either the Impact or Path are blank the Character has to declare an epiphany they have had regarding their crisis. If the Character cannot the Quest adds a complication to the original crisis. 

     When the crisis resolves play ends.
