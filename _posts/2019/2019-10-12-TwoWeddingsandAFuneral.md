```
3+ players
 
-- First Wedding --
Each player writes, on a separate slip of paper, a type of wedding attendee: perhaps a member of the wedding party (e.g. bride, best man), a guest (e.g. groom's childhood friend, bride's uncle), or staff (e.g. caterer, DJ). 
 
Shuffle and randomly assign the roles.
 
Starting with the last player to attend a wedding, each player gives a short statement introducing their character and relationships to the other guests. The statement takes the form of an in-character public address to the assembled wedding attendees: e.g. a vow, a toast, a drunken outburst.
 
Once all players have made their statement, the first wedding concludes. 
 
-- Second Wedding --
Repeat the set-up to create a second wedding. Write and assign new roles. The roles may change, but the characters remain constant. Each player gives another statement, explaining to the second wedding's guests why their role changed. Other characters may respond.
 
-- Funeral --
Mark one slip of paper and randomly assign it to a player. Their character has died. The other characters eulogize at their funeral, reflecting on the momentous life events they shared. Finally, the departed character dictates their will, leaving one bequest to every character.
