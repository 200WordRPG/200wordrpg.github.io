You are criminals, ready to take a big score. Roll 1d6:
1. Jewelry store
2. Bank
3. Home robbery
4. Blackmail
5. Art theft
6. Assassination

Core Mechanic
You will need d6 of two different colors; designate one color as Cool, and the other as Heat. Each PC starts with one die of each color. Whenever you attempt something, the GM will give a difficulty, 2-6, and you will roll all of your Cool and Heat dice. If any Cool dice are equal to or above the difficulty, you succeed. If any Heat are below, there is a complication. Choose your complication:
-Something bad happens to you, and +1 to your Heat dice
-Something less bad happens to everyone, +1 to Threat Meter
PCs can get more Cool dice by making progress, gathering useful items, or generally being great criminals (GM's discretion). 

Threat Meter
The Threat Meter has 6 segments, and tracks the amount of heat on the heist. Every segment filled should complicate the heist for all of the players (more guards, increased security). If the Threat Meter ever fills up, the cops have shut down the heist, get out of there!

This is a super slimmed down version of an ongoing heist game I'm working on. If you're interested in the more complex version, please reach out to me! I also have another microRPG that you can tag onto this, if things go really poorly for the players, which you can find at https://thegilaboy.itch.io/get-to-the-van
