Speakables are arcane investigators who can talk you to death. Each Speakable has a Keyword about 6-7 letters long describing the character and a Lexicon, a word game a suspect must participate in once begun. If investigators are ever bested while employing this Lexicon their Keyword loses one letter. Losing all your letters renders you mute and destroys your rapport with a suspect. You may still write or use charades, unbound by your Lexicon's restrictions. Some suspects may  require besting more than once, or in a certain order, before giving evidence or losing their own powers.

Lexicons:

Interrogator- Participants only speak in questions.
Shadower- Begins each sentence with the last letter of previous sentence.
Magician- Forces participants to "spell" a correctly-used word from another's dialogue.
Decoder- Limits participants to ten-word vocabulary chosen by Decrypter.
Bookbinder- Traps words by writing them down, rendering them forbidden.

Word Crimes:

1. Grimoire Plagiarism
2. Poetry Without a License
3. Loose Tongues
4. Ambush Aphasia
5. Violent Interruption
6. Worder (murder of Magic Words)

Before starting, have someone observing write down the Last Word, an uncommon one, secretly. When this gets said everyone must solve the crime or be rendered Speechless, ending the game.
