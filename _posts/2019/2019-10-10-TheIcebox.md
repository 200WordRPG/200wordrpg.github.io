The Time Police have arrested many criminals and war heroes from across the multiverse, and due to corruption behind the scenes, these people are forced to fight each other in Intergalactic Party World's arena, the ICEbox, in a game show called the Intergalactic Combat Environment.

Players form a team of inmates from across the multiverse, and try to survive their matches while trying to find a way off of Intergalactic Party World.

Players choose 4 skills of their choice, and assigns each a value. 
One of these skills at +3, one at +2, and two at +1. 
These are called your "Character's Skills" and can be anything from Guitar Solos to Pilot Aircraft.

Players then choose between Melee, Ranged, and Magic, and gives themselves a +2 in that skill. 

Players get any two items of their choice that are used with their skills. One item gives a +3 to a skill of your choice, and the other gives a +2 to a different skill.

Skills are performed with D6s equal to your skill rating against a difficulty set by the DM. A difficulty 10 is difficult for someone with a 2 skill, and easy for someone with a 5 skill.
