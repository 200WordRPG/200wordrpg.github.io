Reciprocation

Rule number 1: During this game, you may not say in character anything that you believe to be true about a player out of character.

The richest player will plunge their arm into a bag of rice. They will draw out a fistful and move across the room to place it in their bowl. The other players will catch fallen grains in their own bowls. For every grain they catch they must thank their benefactor. They must earnestly flatter them for every grain, one by one. They must describe their fictional life and their great deeds. Praise the following:

Ruthlessness
Opulence
Fairness
Intelligence
Physical appearance
Devotion to a deity
Virility
Skill in a profession
Honesty
Humility

After drawing rice, choose the next player to draw a smaller fist of rice. If they take too much, prevent them. Repeat this until everyone has drawn rice. Weigh your bowls. The player with the lightest bowl has been lying. They must retract their praise and speak the truth instead, whilst continuing to respect rule number 1. For every insult they may take rice for themselves, and continue until their bowl is the heaviest. When this is done, prepare a meal together.
