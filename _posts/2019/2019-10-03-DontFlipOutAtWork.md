One player is the General Manager (GM), and the rest are minimum-wage workers.
Workers have a NAME, a USELESS COLLEGE MAJOR, and a d6 pool (starts at 1d6).
The Manager has a NAME and can fire anyone on the spot.
 
Before you begin play, describe the following about the store:
	> Name
	> What it sells
	> A dreaded loyal customer

Player goals:
	> Keep your job.
	> Make sure all workplace positions are filled.
Player actions:
	> When your job is infuriating, roll your pool.
		> Roll no sixes: You bottle it up. Add 1d6 to your pool.
	 	> Roll a six: You flip out at work!
	> When you take a secret break, remove 1d6 from your pool, and 
	  put it in the middle. During subsequent breaks, workers place 
	  their  break die on top, forming a tower of laziness. 
	> If the tower collapses on your break, the manager catches you 
	  and flips out at work!
	> When the day is over, go home, sleep for five hours, and start 
	  again the next morning. 

Manager goals:
	> Run the game. Switch roles between manager, customers, and 
	  everyone else.
	> Keep the workplace running.
Manager actions: 
	> Introduce an infuriating customer
	> Break something in the store
	> Fire a worker
