```
#Mood
* The wood are in danger. They are being corrupted by trash. The Woodlings will protect them.

#Before playing
* Go take a walk in the nearby woods. 
* Collect nature materials you find interesting (rocks, leaves, sticks), at least 6 per player.
* Safely take every piece of trash you encounter and put it on a trash bin.

#Set Up
* Present every material you have collected and spread them randomly. 
* Create your Woodling by picking 6 and putting them together.
* Announce their name and title.

#Gameplay
* Pick everything within your reach that could potentially be trash. Each object will be a threat. 
* The player with the weirdest Woodling starts first by choosing one threat and presenting the scene, then asking "Who will deal with it?"
* The first player that answers describes our their Woodling defeats such threat. The Woodling is corrupted and changes one of their materials with the threat's object.
* That players now chooses another threat and the process is repeated. 
* A player can't deal with another threat if there are players that did not played this round yet. 
* The game ends when all threats have been defeated or if all Woodlings have been corrupted.
