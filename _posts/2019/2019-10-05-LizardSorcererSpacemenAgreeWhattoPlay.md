A game of game creation, for a GM and two or more players.

Everyone needs a pencil, some paper and some dice.

Players each write three SKILLS their character has (eg: Safe-cracking, Charioteering, Laser Guns) on a piece of paper.  These are all revealed simultaneously.

Each player then writes down two FACTS they want to be true of the game-world (eg: magic is illegal, everyone is a dog). These are also revealed simultaneously.

The GM then writes down six FACTS about the game-world in order to enrich and reconcile the players' FACTS and SKILLS  (eg: rocket-chariots with laser cannons).  Two are kept hidden, four are revealed.  

On another sheet, the GM displays the session's primary, secondary and tertiary OBJECTIVES.

Players should then go around and introduce their characters, what role they play in this (probably eclectic) world, and why they want to complete the OBJECTIVES.

Roleplay striving to complete the OBJECTIVES.  Actions with a chance of failure are rolled against a GM set threshold, accounting for SKILLS and good roleplay.

During play, each player may establish one additional FACT or gain one additional SKILL.

Afterwards, discuss the setting you all built, and whether you want to play in it again.

Inspired mostly by the germ of an idea I had last year, but with mechanics to support the creative process.  This version co-created by my friend Doris.
