You can't save everyone, you must try nonetheless. With great responsibility comes moderate power. Decide who you are, FBI, police, vigilantes, Neighbourhood Watch, kids in a van. Those who know can rarely act, those with power rarely believe, you must straddle the lines.

SETTING:
Beige computers. Smoking on planes. Colour TV. Pagers. Housewives. 

RULES:
If it just happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't
If you might not succeed, flip a coin. Heads you do
If something bad might happen AS WELL, flip. Heads it doesn't
Apply coins to any outcome
More risk, +1 coin, +1 bad thing
Prepared for exact situation, +1 coin

There are Exceptional people with powers unknown: if they turn to violence, you must stop them. You must save them.

EXCEPTIONS BREAK THE RULES:
They have talents, spells, knacks. You can't beat them with just coins. They have plenty power, little control, no training. They are desperate, scared, sad, hungry, angry, trapped. If they want it, you will die.

Roll twice, combine:
Fire		See
Water		Hear
Earth		Smell
Air		Touch
Metal		Taste
Wood		Music
Mind		Time
Body		Doom
Life		Creation
Death		Nothing

+10 points for "bringing in" Exception. -1 per death, including theirs, including yours.

One part X-Files, one part Scooby Doo, plenty of running in fear! There might be options for playing as an Exception, but that is beyond the scope of these few words.
