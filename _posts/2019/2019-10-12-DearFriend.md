For 2 players using letters written from the perspective of their character, sent via snail mail. There are 8 exchanges, for a total of 16 letters. 7 rounds have predetermined prompts, as follows:

Home
Hope
Love
Hate
Fear
Light
Darkness

 The 8th is chosen by player 1. Prompts are intentionally vague. 

Player 1 is the person who most recently received personal correspondence. They write a classified ad seeking their ideal pen-pal, 40 words or less, including their mailing address and an inspiration for setting. The ad ends with the eighth prompt. They share this ad using the method of their choice. 

Example:
Pen Pal for conversation. Must love storytelling and have diverse interests. Ideally lives near a temporal vortex. 8 River Dr., Pallino, MA, 99999. FLAME.
Player 2 responds, and play continues back and forth.

When writing a letter, roll a D6 and compare the result to the numeral of the day the most recent letter was postmarked. If both are odd or both even, the prompt results in a "good" outcome. Otherwise, it is "bad". Players determine what this means. 

Be creative. Suggestions include hand-made envelopes, lovely cards, pictures, or flowers.

Thanks to my friends for help fine tuning the idea, particularly Luke, a fantastic GM and even better human.
