You call yourselves the Boys, a gaggle of petty and absurd stepdads. You're about to fuck everything up again.

Get a Pool Table set up for Snooker. Ideally you suck at it. Dim the lights and drink some beers. Each player picks a hole for themselves and comes up with a dumb nickname.

One of the boys has a genius scheme. He makes the break.

Rotating around the left, each player narrates what their character will do, and makes a snooker shot at a red ball. If a ball goes in to a hole, they get another turn and can target colored balls.

If a red ball goes in a player's hole, that player narrates how that action fucked them over.

If a colored ball goes into a hole, that hole's associated player has his cravings and grudges sated. Say how.

If a player hits a foul, something bad happens to them instead of anyone else.

The game ends when the black is sunk. The player who took the shot miraculously escapes whatever consequences the boy's night out created. Every other player narrates their Boy's final fate until next time.
