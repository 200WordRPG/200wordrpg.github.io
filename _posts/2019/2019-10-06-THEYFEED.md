THEY eat people. THEY spread. Your group survived. Resources are scarce. The shelter depends on you.

Each survivor needs 1 long grocery receipt, pencil, d4s. Survivors start with (100 - receipt price total) luck. Who are you? Why do you protect the shelter?

-Round all numbers down

Goals:
-Scavenge supplies
-Avoid THEM. 

Each Day: 
(1) Traveling
(2) Scavenging
(3) Transporting
(4) Resting

First 3 phases:
-Player rolls d4 for an obstacle (THEM).
-Describe location, objects, obstacle.
-Each survivor strikes-through 1+ receipt items for an action. Describe. Add your prices.
-Roll (phase #)d4 for obstacle. Add all the d4s. Do THEY notice you?
-If survivor's price >= obstacle, survivor unnoticed. Move to next phase. 
-Noticed survivors must strikethrough receipt discounts to lower notice or lose luck = highest, two d4 rolled. Describe how.

Scavenging:
Survivors find goods. Spend luck = item price. Circle receipt items and price to acquire. Survivors narrate search. How do they feel about what they find?

Resting:
Survivors hand out goods. Strikethrough circled items. Each survivor gains luck = (combined receipt item prices / player count). Narrate survivor's interaction with shelter people and group. Who are they?

Strikethrough items are gone.

0 luck or receipt items = survivor dies. Narrate their end.
```
## Author Comments
Such an interesting challenge. More words and I would have included a traveling encumbrance system. (Combined prices of item you acquire / 2) would have lowered your action in the (3) transporting phase.
