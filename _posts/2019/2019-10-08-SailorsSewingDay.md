```
You are a sailor at sea. Today you are mending your clothes.

Each player needs a sheet of paper towel, needle, and thread. 

For each sheet:  
Tear a line from edge to center.
Rip out a hole.
Rip off a corner.

Put all scraps together in the middle of the group. Decide the nature of your ship and why it is at sea.

Each player threads their needles. As you do, talk about who you are and how you came to be on the ship.  

A player begins sewing one rip/tear on their sheet. Randomly take a scrap from the center to mend missing pieces. 

Based on what you are mending, talk about:
Tear - An unfinished business or regret.
Hole - A special person and why they are special.
Corner - How you almost died in the ship, and how you were saved. 

Players take turns sharing stories based on the prompts until everyone has taken a turn. The round moves when all rips/tears selected in the previous round are mended. Fill time by conversing on what has been shared. 

When all rips are mended, talk about how each sailor has grown at sea and how their clothes reflect this.
