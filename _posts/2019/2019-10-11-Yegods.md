You're a pantheon of capricious, bored gods who amuse yourselves by meddling in one mortal's day.

Each player-god is able to manipulate the world remotely, but mortals retain their autonomy.

Roll for each player's god-type: god of... (d6)
1 - Justice
2 - Love
3 - War
4 - Trickery
5 - Vengeance
6 - Snakes

Each player starts with 3 god points (gp).

Name the target NPC mortal, e.g. Chad. Play through a mundane event in Chad's life, e.g. morning routine, going on a date, doing photocopying. 

The GM narrates this event action by action. A player can spend 1gp to INTERCEDE and become active player. They narrate how they HELP or HINDER Chad at that moment, in keeping with their god-type. Active player then regains 1gp and rolls d6; other players can spend 1gp to modify this intercession by +1 or -1, explaining how they assist/impede the active god. 

4+: Chad succeeds
<4: Chad fails

Then the GM resumes narration until a player intercedes again.

If Chad gets 5 successes his event ends favourably. If he gets 5 failures he non-fatally fails. 

Players aim to manipulate Chad's life to get a conclusion that aligns with their god-type.
