Comrade of the Glorious Revolution! The president is dead. Turn on a radio (or song, or podcast, or Video); the next sentence you hear were his/her last words. Each person is a member of the ruling party.

Sequester everyone until you can create a unified front behind a new President. Anyone who enters needs to be sworn to secrecy.

Everyone takes turns declaring their position in the cabinet before the death of the President. Using social media, phones, etc, reach out to people to seek their support for your position as President, but without letting them know that the President is dead. These people are Members of the Glorious Revolution.

If two or more people gain the purported support of the same Member of the Glorious, they each need to make a speech to the remaining members of the cabinet. Everyone in the room then votes to award the support of those Members to one of the people giving a speech.

First person to a majority of at least 10 supporters becomes the new President and gets to decide their cabinet.
