You represent a festering establishment. Like Icarus chasing the sun, you carry your people to their imminent and completely evitable demise.

Build a Jenga tower at the center of the table. You will destabilize this Regime, your people's tomorrow, for the sake of your own today. Consider Versailles, Babel, Krypton, Atlantis, environmental policy.

Describe your broad Domain, individual Titles, and decadent Vices. Take turns narrating and governing selfishly, or rule alone.

Whenever you:
...*Underestimate Suffering* or *Belittle Your Advisers*, pull a brick from the Regime. Place it in the Treasury.
...*Boast of Your Vision* or *Revel In Luxury*, construct Vanity Projects around the Regime's foundation using the Treasury. Build palaces, armies, idols, gardens. Dream of a legacy.

If a Vanity Project falls, blame it on a factor outside your control. Then, place its bricks atop the Regime.

When the Regime falls, the future you refused to see is now the present. Narrate how it all goes wrong. The game is over.

At any time, your dynasty can step down and hand power to someone more capable. Briefly narrate how they will be a force for good, then place one hand on the doomed Regime and shove it over. See above.

Early in the design stages, I had Après Moi by Regina Spektor stuck in my head almost 24/7. It wasn't particularly relevant to the game, but it sure was an Experience.
