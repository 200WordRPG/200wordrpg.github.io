One Game Master. One silent Golem. One RPG dice set. Hope starts at d12.

Begin play in the ever-expansive Sunless Sands. 

GOLEM ASKS:
-What burning runes mark my hull?
-What eerie Threat lurks nearby?
-What steading am I lumbering towards?

Then play five scenes, each centered on a possible Maker.

GOLEM ASKS:
-What is their Vocation?
-How do they show themselves to be both kind and unkind?
-How are we connected?
-What do they want to use me for?

When the Golem communicates "are you my maker?" roll Hope, then decrease the die size. If you rolled a 3 or lower, there is strong evidence they are. 

After the fifth scene, the Golem chooses a new Master or renounces them all and wanders the Sunless Sands. 

Then the Threat descends upon you.

GOLEM ANSWERS:
-What hope do I have?
-Does the threat overpower me?
-Whose servant am I?
