Take a deck, shuffle it, place it between you two. Gather tokens to represent your memories, your right to live.

One of you is a doppelganger. One of you is real. You can't remember who is who. Why?

Create three things: 
+ the identity you fight for
+ who you love most
+ what happens if the doppelganger is undiscovered

Spread the cards, draw one. Share a memory of:

CLUBS: Passion, mistakes well made.
SPADES: Violence, lies well received.
HEARTS: Love, corrupted and sincere.
DIAMONDS: Treasure, intangible and deadly.

The other responds. Draw one.

CLUBS: No! What actually happened was... (Gain 2 tokens)
SPADES: No. Maybe. From a certain point of view... (Gain 1 token)
HEARTS: Yes, but! You forgot something essential...(Lose 1 token)
DIAMONDS: Yes, and as a consequence...(Lose 2 tokens).

Draw cards until someone: 
+ Reaches 6 tokens
+ Despairs and gives up
+ Falls in love with someone else

When the doppelganger is revealed, draw two cards each. Reveal from your heart: 

CLUBS: Your selfish desire
SPADES: Your haunting truth
HEARTS: Your true intentions
DIAMONDS: Your hidden weapon

What happens next? Be gracious, be kind. Forgive, and let go. Forget, if you like.

Or kill, and be done with it. 
```
