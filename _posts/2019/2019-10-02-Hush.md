A paranoid, conversational game of finding community for 1 Keeper of Silence and 2-5 Strangers. 

The first thing you noticed was the quiet, a rare and heavy phenomenon that has now grown to be your everyday. But you have finally found others and desperately reach for connections, slowly realizing how everyone became so sick...

Strangers each secretly write 5 Desires in this empty world but can never give them voice. Strangers each place a D6 Community Die in front of them set to 2.

The Keeper secretly writes 8 Poisoned Words and begins a 5-minute timer.

Strangers speak of their world, their silence, and ask questions of other Strangers. If any Stranger utters a Poisoned Word, the Keeper will soon give them a token. When the timer runs out, the Keeper writes 2 new Poisoned Words and restarts the timer. When a Stranger states or fulfills another's Desire, it is announced, and the fulfilling Stranger increases their Community Die by 1 and gives 1 token back to the Keeper. That Desire is crossed out.

If all Strangers' Community Dice are set to 6 they have found a new community, home. If any Stranger gets 8 tokens, they perish.

I love the idea of select language becoming poisonous and of players becoming increasingly paranoid of how they communicate to each other. There's a more difficult, GM-less version of this where there are no Poisoned Words, but every player keeps a tally of how many words they have spoken. If they speak 201 words, they perish.
