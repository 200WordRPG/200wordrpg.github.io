You are two nervous bugs on a date! 

Before!
Plan a nice day inside together - cooking a meal, reading on the couch, watching a movie, etc.
Get one pool noodle, boffer weapon, or something that doesn't hurt much to get devastated by. Decide which bug gets the weapon. For politeness, male bugs offer up the weapon first. Agree where it's okay to strike the Unarmed Bug.
Bugs introduce one another by stating something they find pleasant or alluring about the other bug. Use bug words like carapace, mandibles, or make up new bug terms.

Play!
Start your date by physically doing the activity planned! Talk about your bug day, your bug lives, or your ideal bug relationship.
Keep the weapon within reach of the Armed Bug. Remind the Unarmed Bug it's nearby. The Unarmed Bug may never touch the weapon.
During the date, the Armed Bug may pick up the weapon and strike the Unarmed Bug. If struck, they are now dead and may no longer participate in the date's activities. The Armed Bug may continue the date alone until they wish to end the date.
The Unarmed Bug may flee the date at any time, ending the date.
