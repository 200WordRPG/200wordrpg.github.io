YOU NEED: 
1d6, at least 1 Player, you as Game Master

INIT:
Create(if you can) or remember a story with genre, that Players like. It can be a movie, a game, poem or just a short novell. Don't care about every detail, just be sure you can tell a basic plot

INTRO:
Choose suitable characters for Players. Tell Players about story world, epoch, region and their characters. Based on story, you tell just "you woke up at dark room", or give detailed description about character childhood. Don't create too detailed rules - game mostly about fantasy - give as much freedom as possible

GAME:
Story - pack of choices characters make. Every time Player needs to make a choice - ask him to roll a dice. Prepare to create a story reaction on that:

1 - bad decision with consequences
2 - bad choice, minor problems
3 - fail
4 - success
5 - success, small benefit
6 - great choice, good reward!

RULES:
none/any 
(Players decide what to do, you decide when they roll)

OUTRO:
Perhaps, it's a story without begin and end, but better create a final goal. F.e. survive for an hour in the world of Lovecraft or take control at Death Star

This game driven by Players and yours fantasy) I'd created it to tell my girlfriend about many beautiful video games worlds without actually telling her it is a video game ;) But game works perfect with a short or long movies and novels. This game is a good way to introduce an unknown world to a Players, because they involved to be inside it and actually do important choices there. Sometimes I create some simple rules such as labyrinths, maps, hitpoints or secret goal for each character, it works fine but need game designers skills for game balance. I hope you try it, enjoy!
