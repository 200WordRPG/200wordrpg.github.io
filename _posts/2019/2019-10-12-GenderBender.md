Gender's weird. Is it what's in your pants? What you wear? How you interact with others? In this GM-less game, you play characters struggling with these questions and how to best express themselves.

On slips of paper, write:
 -a gender assignment (M/F)
 -a gender role (a role placing one in a gendered group, e.g. housewife, lesbian)
 -a gender expression (observable behavior/appearance, e.g. butch, goth clown)
Pass the assignment to the right and the role to the left. Reveal only your expression. 

Secretly write down a gender identity, working with or against your slips. It can be anything: a picture, a noun, a normative assignment. Include pronouns.

Pick a situation: an interview, blind date, dinner party, etc.. Decide on roles within it. Set up a Jenga tower. Narrate your setting and actions, touching the tower when speaking in character. Hint at your identity without explicitly saying it. Whenever you use a pronoun or interact with a gendered expectation, remove a block and add it to the top of the tower. 

When the tower falls, collectively narrate an ending. Each player contributes one sentence at a time, concluding with a sentence from each player revealing their gender identity.
