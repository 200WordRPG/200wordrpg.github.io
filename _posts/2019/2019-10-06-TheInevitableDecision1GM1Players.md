"You used to be a barista. Now, you're a God... AND a barista." This game is about balancing humanity and newly-discovered divinity, and the inevitable decision you must face.

About-You
- Name
- Domain
- Dayjob
- The Scale. Where you stand between your Mortal life and your Divine powers. 3 Divine = -3 Mortal, and vice-versa. +3 Max.
- Bonds-Alliances. These represent your Mortal & Divine relationships. You have thirteen of each.

When there's uncertainty, determine if you're performing Mortal or Divine actions. For Mortal Actions, roll 1d6+Mortal+Bonds. For Divine Actions, roll 1d6+Divine+Alliances. 1-3 = Fail. 4-6 = Success. You may spend Alliances-Bonds to boost Mortal-Divine actions respectively.

When you help people, or otherwise prioritize humanity, you may gain a bond or shift towards Mortal. You lose an Alliance. When you ignore people, or otherwise prioritize Divinity, you may gain an Alliance or shift towards Divine. You lose a Bond.

The Decision. What young Gods fear. Will you give up on humanity or divinity? When you have no Bonds, you have no reason to stay. You leave and become a God forever. When you have no Alliances, you have no power among Gods. You give up and remain human.

Hey, this is my first submission! I want to thank all my friends who helped me with proofreading and getting it down to 200! This game is actually based on a larger RPG I am working on called "Wardens of Reality." I plan on writing up a post that goes into more depth on the mechanics and themes behind the game. Ultimately, I thought the idea of young deities having to decide between being entirely human or entirely divine, while thinking they could try to balance it, had some serious potential. It's really similar to some superhero stories, but turned to the extreme!
