You are a seamstress. Or a weaver. Or a painter. You practice your craft with each item you create.

Set up your canvas with at least two colors to use. From a standard deck of cards, use only the 2s-10s. Shuffle the cards. Each card represents one item to craft. All items are crafted on the same canvas.

Each turn, draw one card. Stitch (or weave or paint) that number of times in one color to create the item. As you work, describe out loud why this item exists.

Suggested themes:
*Spade - An item for yourself
*Heart - A gift for another
*Club - A commissioned piece
*Diamond - An incomplete or abandoned item

Suggested descriptions:
*The item itself
*Why you're making it
*Any complications that arose during its creation
*Who it's for
*The time of year

After an item is completed, change to a different color and start a new turn. Play until all cards are drawn or when you've created enough items.

Possible variations:
*Different color per suit
*Different stitch/design per item
*Create items that overlap each other
*Card numbers indicate the complexity of the item, descriptively and/or literally

This was envisioned to be played with embroidery, but any arts and craft-ish activity can be used. Share your canvas with me on twitter!
