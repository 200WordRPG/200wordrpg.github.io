The end is nigh and your cult is working hard to bring glory to your deity.

As a group determine: 
- Deity's and Cult's Name
- Deity's Symbols and Signs
- Core Rituals and Texts
- Cult Accoutrement

Games last d6 + 2 rounds.

Your Deity's Temperament (DT) starts at 8. If it becomes <1 you immediately lose or >21 the apocalypse ends early.

Your cult membership starts with number of players + 1.

On your turn describe how you carry out a move, roll for DT, then explain the outcome as a mini-sermon.


## Moves

Convert Populace
+3d6/2 members

Evangelize or Complete a Ritual
+d6 members; double a positive DT roll

Purge Heretics (requires >10 members)
-d6 members; +1 to DT

Promote Prophet
+5d6 members; double a negative DT roll

Undercut Rivals
d6+1 members move to your cult


## Rolling DT

Roll 1d6
>3, +d6/2 to your DT (rounding down)
Else, -d6/2 to your DT (rounding up)


## End of Game

Describe how you are the chosen ones and how your deity treats you after the end based on DT + Members (<45 angry, 46-129 ambivalent, 130+ happy).

Bonus: Split into groups as rival cults and compete for apocalyptic salvation!
