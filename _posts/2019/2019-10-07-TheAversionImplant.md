They thought you were sleeping when they implanted the thing in your head. 

Who? Why? Is it dangerous?

A bundle of clues sits on your nightstand. Who could have left it?
There's a note in a code you understand: "If you want to know, find out why you don't want to go" followed by several numbers. There's a one-day bus pass and directions to the nearest bus stop.

Make your clues using numbers from a fortune cookie, or from gaming dice. 

When you have plenty of time, take a pen, the bus pass and clues to the bus stop and start your investigation.

Take notes in code.

What makes you want to avoid going where you'll find the answers?
Who wouldn't want you in these places? 
Why do they want you to stay away?
Is "common sense safety" just the aversion effect of your implant?
The numbers will take you to places you don't want to go.  Are they bus routes, the number of stops you should ride, numbers you'll recognize in clues, street addresses of important places? 

When you've solved the mystery, will you return home, or will what you learn change everything?
