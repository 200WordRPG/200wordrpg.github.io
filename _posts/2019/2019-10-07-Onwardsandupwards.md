Pollution and war made Earth unlivable, and humanity are looking to Mars. Going to Mars is expensive. You are poor. You will have to get there through sneaking on ships, forging papers, and by other Illegal means.
Each player has his own set of cards (no jokers), and starts the game with a hand of 5 cards. When trying to achieve something, he will play a card from his hand (ace=1, jack=11, queen=12, king=13), and if the number is greater than or equal to an undisclosed goal number Set by the GM, the player succeeds (the task).
_______________________________________________________________
Drawing and damage
a player can always redraw back to 5 cards. If he does that after he played all the cards in his hand, he first reshuffles the played cards back to the deck. If a player chooses to redraw before emptying his hand, he throws the played cards to the discard pile.
Whenever a character gets hit and suffers damage, the player must throw 5 cards from the top of his deck to the discard pile.
If a player discards his entire deck, his character dies.
