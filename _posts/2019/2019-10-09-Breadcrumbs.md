```
Each player is an investigator. Start only with faint description of crime or perpetrator.

Allocate 4, 6, 8, 10 between soldier, investigator, scientist and negotiator traits. Lower is better.

Active player alternates and frames and resolves his scene. Take your time, let other players take part as NPC's and help you tell story. Each scene ends with roll. Choose trait that suits best and roll 2d6.

If you rolled equal or higher to chosen trait, add its value to success pool and describe how you moved the investigation forward.

If you ever collect 25 points per player, investigators win. Tell epilogue together.

If you rolled less, take hit or obstruct investigation.

To take hit, increase trait you just used by 3 and describe how you were irreversibly damaged. If you cannot (because it will be more than 12), you can leave story instead. Tell your epilogue how you died or became crazy...

Alternatively you can obstruct investigation. Play a flashback scene from the perpetrator's point of view. Prepare some trap to investigators. From now everyone will get -1 to their rolls. If this is ever done five times, perpetrator wins. Describe epilogue what happened, everyone should take part.
