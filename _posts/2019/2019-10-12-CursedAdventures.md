```
Draw a king, whose suit determines your adventurer's curse:
Heart: Heart encounters heal you for half as much.
Diamond: You take 1 damage at the beginning of every turn.
Club: Subtract 1 from every die you roll.
Spade: Your lowest die doesn't count when you attack

To start, you get 2 d6's for attacking. You start with 20 max health.

To fight: Take turns rolling your attack dice. Subtract the total from your enemies health.

Every round draw 1 card for every player in game. Decide who will take each card. These cards determine your encounters, as follows:
Heart: You meet a healer. Describe them. Heal player for card's value.
Diamond: Take the card. If the diamond cards you are holding have a combined value of 6 or greater, then you may discard them to level up. When you level up, add 10 to your max health, and take 1 more d6 attack die.
Club or Spade: You encounter an enemy with health equal to card value and d6's for attack equal to card value divided by 4, rounded up. Describe your enemy, then fight.

Everyone loses when anyone's hp reaches 0.
If you clear the whole deck, you win!
