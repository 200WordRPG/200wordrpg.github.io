A game for 1+ players.

The boys are eldritch entities who return to town once a year, heralding the arrival of summer. But who are they? What do they want? What will happen?

Blast your favourite song. Pour drinks. Spread the word: they will be here soon.

Each round, read the prompts, write down your answers, and share with the group. If answers don't match up, find a way to merge them in a way that leaves you all confused and doubting your memories.

Round 1
1. "Wild-eyed and dressed to kill." Describe the Boys. Are they human?
2. What is the last death you remember happening when the boys were here?
3. Where do they go each year? Why does summer always return with them? Does it?

Round 2
1. They're looking for you. Why? Where are you?
2. "You're cool, you're red-hot, you're steaming." What powers does this give you?
3. You slapped a Boy once. Why? What happened?

Round 3
1. The Boys are at their usual place in town. Where?
2. The Boys want to fight. Who? How does it go down?
3. What happens to the town now that the Boys are back?
