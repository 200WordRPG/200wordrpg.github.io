Sit in a circle. We each play an expert fighter, and each take turns playing Suzanne. Choose your expert's area of martial expertise, or roll a d6 on the list below:
     1. Jiu-jitsu
     2. Capoeira
     3. Krav Maga
     4. Muay Thai
     5. Taekwondo
     6. Bare-knuckle boxing

Decide who will be Suzanne first. Suzanne attempts to challenge the expert to her left to a fight. Suzanne is an ordinary, small-ish and not particularly strong or coordinated woman. If the fight occurs, Suzanne will definitely be knocked out, and almost no one wants that. 

-Expert Fighters: Try to talk Suzanne out of fighting you, by whatever means you see fit: reasoning with her, convincing her to fight someone else, demonstrating your superior martial prowess in indirect ways, distracting her, etc. 

-Suzanne: You can probably take any of these chumps. It would probably be fun. Try to convince the expert to your left to fight, just for the hell of it.

After two minutes, or Suzanne is convinced to move on, play passes left; the last fighter becomes the new Suzanne, and challenges the expert on her left. Play until everyone has been Suzanne, or Suzanne has been knocked out.
