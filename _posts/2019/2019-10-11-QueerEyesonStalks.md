(For 3+ players.)

One person plays an arrogant and paranoid Beholder who feels a bit stuck in life and is ready to accept positive change through a make-over TV-show.

They decide some things about the beholder, which are known to the other players at the start of the game.

Name
Who nominated you
An event that's coming up that you're preparing for

Secretly, decided the following:

Something touchy you'd kill someone for mentioning
Most dangerous part of lair
One positive personal connection
The individual effects of your ten eye rays


Everyone else makes an adventurer:

Name
Class (such as wizard, food and wine expert, personal trainer, therapist, bard, stylist, etc.)
Why you naively think you have a good chance of making it out alive


Create short scenes between one adventurer and the beholder. The other players play producers (and minor characters) and decide what's the premise for each scene before it begins.

After each adventurer who is still alive has had four scenes with the beholder. Narrate the event and how the beholder has changed.

Everyone separately writes down what the lesson learnt was. Judge your success on how close / coherent your answers were.

I'd like to thank Netflix's Queer Eye, and the Fab Five.  Y'all are wholesome.
