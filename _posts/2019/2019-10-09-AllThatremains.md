This game needs a GM and two or more players. 

A world is being devastated. The GM explains how, and what can save it. The players are in charge of saving as much as possible.

Each player chooses a name, role, and three people, principles, or things that are important to them. The GM starts a secret tracker. Play begins.

The GM creates a disaster and says who or what it will doom. Any player may sacrifice something important to stop it, explaining how. If no one does, the GM records what is lost and adds 1 to the tracker. If someone does, the GM records what was saved and adds d4 to the tracker. The GM then names the next disaster.

When the tracker reaches (Players x4), the GM gives an update on the end of the world. When the tracker reaches (Players x7), the GM explains how the players have almost won. When the tracker reaches (Players x8), the disasters end.

The GM explains what was lost and what was saved. Each player explains what their place in the new world is, and what their sacrifices left them with.

Decide if the result was worth the cost.

This is my first try at a 200-word RPG! Thanks to everyone whose posts encouraged me to go ahead and make the attempt - there have been some wonderful submissions already.
