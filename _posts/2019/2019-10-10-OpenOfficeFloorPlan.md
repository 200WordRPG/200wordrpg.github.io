3-5 Workers and 1 Boss

Workers:

Aspects - Name; Education; Job Title; Personality Quirk.

Stats - Productivity 5/Sanity 4 or the reverse. Zero Boss Points

Pick two other players that owe you a Favor. You can call in a Favor to roll at advantage (roll twice, pick the lowest).

You can offer help at any time so the player rolls at advantage. They now owe you a Favor.

Boss:

Choose projects for the workers to cooperate on. Make sure only one person ever gets credit for the work. Assign project roles that don't match Education or Job Title. Give out Boss Points as they complete work. First worker to 10 points gets promoted.

Resolution - Only call for a roll if there's an interesting chance of failure. Player rolls 1d8 against either productivity or sanity (your choice). If the die roll is equal to or lower than the stat, they succeed. They describe how. Then, they increase the stat used by one and decrease the other by one. On a failed roll, complicate their life.

If they reach 1 Sanity, they have a mental breakdown. If they reach 1 Productivity, they're immediately fired. In both cases, player describes how.
