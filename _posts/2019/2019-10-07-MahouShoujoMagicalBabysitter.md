A game for 4 players:
* Babysitter
* Kids
* Parents
* EVIL

Kids:
Play all children. Be troublesome.
Also play all imaginary or fanciful people.

Parents:
Play the parents. Be aloof.
Also play all boring people.

Babysitter:
You must take care of the Kids. You should fix the Parents, too. You face EVIL on the 7th Night.
Also play your magical minions.
After the 7th scene, EVIL attacks the world 7 times. Roll a d6 and describe stopping the attack. Add Love when you use moral virtue. Add Discipline when you use cool superpowers. On a 7+, you do it. If you stop 5 attacks, EVIL loses. Otherwise, the world ends.

EVIL:
Destroy the world!
And introduce complications during scenes to undermine the Babysitter.
Also play all jerk and monsters.
After the 7th scene, describe your 7 Attacks.

Play 7 scenes over 7 days. Any player may set a scene, but each must do so at least once.

In scenes, players describe their characters' actions, words, nearby events, powerful magic, etc.

After each scene, if the Kids felt loved they award the Babysitter 1 Love. If the Parents think the Babysitter did their job, they award them 1 Discipline.
