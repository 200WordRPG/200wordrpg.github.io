Each player starts with 1 MANA, then another each turn.
During their turn, they either Store or Cast MANA.

Storing saves the point for next turn.
Casting spends all MANA to Enhance your dish by as many stars, Defend against spells equal or lower than the MANA you spent, or cause Mischief lowering an opponent's BAKE.


Stats:

BAKE: How delicious your treats are. Can be temporarily increased or decreased with MANA(minimum:-2 maximum:+3). Starts at 1.

REPUTATION: How much civilians admire you. If it drops to 0, you're executed as a witch. Starts at 3.


You roll 1d6+BAKE to determine your recipe's stars:

<0: Putrid. -1 REPUTATION and BAKE, or 2 REPUTATION if BAKE's at minimum.

1-2: Disgusting. -1 REPUTATION.

3: Bland. No loss/gain.

4-5: Delicious! +1 REPUTATION

6<: Golden Dish! Immune to Mischief! +1 REPUTATION

Outside events can affect the bakers stats, thieves that make great secret ingredients and supernatural connections to help your business thrive! ...If you pay your debts.
