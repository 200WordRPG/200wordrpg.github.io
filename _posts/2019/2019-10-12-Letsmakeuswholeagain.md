A group of three to five players gather together to slay the evil cosmic horror wizard Ennui. Players are given templates of characters (GM's choice) and mst add their own flourish and backstory in character creation. The players are then dropped outside the two room dungeon of Ennui itself. In the first room they enter trances and must defeat their inner demons defined at character creation. Between the GM and the other players each player in turn work to defeat or resolve the backstory. After each half hour slot the player may announce whether or not they have dealt with their inner demons. Play for fun, laughs, love and tears. After doing all players they face Ennui and are given 3-5 perks against it depending on previous room. Finish. This all may require an experience GM but players of any level of experience can play and enjoy of course.
