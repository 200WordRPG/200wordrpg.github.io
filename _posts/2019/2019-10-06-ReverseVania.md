```
You are a GALACTIC/GOTHIC BOUNTY HUNTER.
This is your LAST MISSION, but you know only this:
You must stop FULIGIN STAR.
And you're willing to SACRIFICE EVERYTHING.

=====

Each day, ROLL A SIX-SIDED DIE and RECORD A STAR LOG...

-----

On results you HAVE NOT YET rolled, SACRIFICE a power:
1: POWER SHELL
2: POWER BOOST
3: POWER MORPH
4: POWER SIGHT
5: POWER BEAM
6: POWER SWORD

Then, consider these questions and RECORD your STAR LOG:
> How was your sacrifice forced, and by whom?
> How did you track your target, and to where?
> What made the sacrifice worth it?
> What has driven you to stop FULIGIN STAR?

>>> On your final SACRIFICE, you stop FULIGIN STAR.
>>> How will you be REMEMBERED FOREVER?

-----

On results you HAVE ALREADY rolled, EXPLORE a setting instead:
1: VOLCANIC CAVERNS
2: COASTAL CLIFFSIDE
3: GLACIAL LABORATORY
4: FLYING MOUNTAINS
5: LUMINESCENT JUNGLE
6: SUNKEN MONASTERY

Then, consider these questions and RECORD your STAR LOG:
> What new strangeness have you uncovered?
> When did you feel the loss of your sacrifices?
> What will be forgotten if you stop here?
> How does FULIGIN STAR taunt you?

=====

Press EVER ONWARD.
Stop FULIGIN STAR.
Be REMEMBERED FOREVER.

=====

> HACK: RE-ROLL repetitive settings.
