```
You are an elite infiltration/exfiltration team composed of pigeons. 

Choose a name, a skill (e.g. explosives, hacking, wing-to-wing combat), a weakness.

Give each pigeon 3 cards. Write on each a pigeon-y action (e.g. bristling feathers, unexpected defecation). 

PM Questions

- What is your target? 
- What protects it? 
- What are you after? 

Use their answers to challenge the team.

Pigeons are small and the world is large; success requires fast, silent, coordination.

When an obstacle is encountered every pigeon will suggest a plan. The PM will secretly rank the plans (1 is best).

Each pigeon will indicate their preferred plan using a card. No other communication is allowed. Then they will secretly and simultaneously commit to a plan.

For each mission roll 1d6: 

For every pigeon on the mission;
For every pigeon that uses their skill;
If plan creator chose it;
If the plan was described using only cards. 

Subtract 1d6 for every pigeon that exposes their weakness.
 
A success is a 4+. A mission succeeds if the number of successes exceeds the plan's rank. 

If a mission succeeds the team progresses. Failures cause complications and every failure increases the next missions' success requirement by one.

## Author Comments
The goal of the game was to encourage players to collaboratively and develop a new understanding of silly, arbitrary symbols. The game places great importance on coordination in the absence of ordinary communication and so encourages the creation of this pigeon pidgin.
