```
Take turns telling fun, bizarre and over the top stories.
Each tale must contain one of each of the following plot points.
A Truth,    
A Lie
A big Exaggeration
The listeners writes down their private guesses for each and reveal them at the same time. Two points for each matching plot point, and one point for finding a plot point but placing it in the wrong location.
You then rotate to the next player who starts their tale, using the same system.
Repeat until each player has had a go, then tally up the points and find the winner/winners.
