You and your allies are doing something dangerous: navigating the dungeon, fighting the horde, settling the feud, etc.

You've come prepared, but you'll still need luck on your side.

As a group, determine the scenario, and elect a Guide to act in Opposition to the players' goals.

To start the game, every player rolls a die or flips a coin and records the result (odd/even | heads/tails). This is your lucky token.

Players start with 2 Objects of their choice and 3 Serendipity.

An Object: Anything you can hold in your hands.

At any point players may spend 1 Serendipity to:

Gain an Object - Retroactively explain how you obtained the item.
Know a Person - Declare your previous association with an individual.
Change a Fact - Point out an untruth, and how it affects the situation.

After doing so, test your luck:
Roll the die/flip the coin. If the result matches your lucky token, you succeed. If not, you fail.

On success: The state of the game changes in the way that you suggested.

On failure: The Guide explains how your Serendipity Complicates the situation further.

Play until out of Serendipity. The Guide then narrates an end to the scenario.

Serendipity started out as a subsystem for a larger game that I am working on releasing, which will technically now be the second game I've ever made (with Serendipity being the first). This is a bit of a rework of the system in the game, and I hope you enjoy it!

It was inspired by the RPG Fate, and the goal within a larger game is to solve scenarios where a player finds their character in a situation where they "should have had an item because ~."
