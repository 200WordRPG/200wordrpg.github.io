```
You are a group of three to four researchers at a remote location (describe) to save the world. Discuss the nature of the issue to be solved. Each researcher secretly choses one of the following words:

FAME
PRESSURE
SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS
BOASTING
SOCIAL CONTACTS
RELATIONSHIP

This is the real reason you're here. Flesh out your character.

The game is divided in four scenes, in which players take turns as the lead researcher. During each scene: roll a six-sided die, consult the table below and narrate how your characters proposes a solution. Let other players react in character.

1-2: A quick fix, which doesn't solve anything.
3-4: An expensive fix which has no support.
4-6: A good fix which introduces a bigger issue.
7: A great fix which will ensure public outrage.
8: The perfect fix at the expense of half of the world population.

A player may opt to show her/his real objective to add 2 to the die roll. Narrate how the personal issue affects the solution.
Play ends with a vote (own solution is excepted). When you showed your objective, your vote doubles. Ties mean no solution is approved. Narrate together how the world ends.

Loosely based on a session of Fiasco which has a north pole research location player.
