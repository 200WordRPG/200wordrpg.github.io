Requires: 3-6 players, cards numbered 1-6.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Heads bow. Tears swell. Rain falls.

The pastor gives blessing. The coffin of a great man is lowered into the dirt. His name is etched in stone. You pay your respects.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deal one card each. At the pub, you toast to his memory. You're his:

1.	Parent
2.	Child
3.	Spouse
4.	Best friend
5.	Colleague
6.	Old-flame.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Re-deal. You raise your glass and speak in turn, reflecting on how:

1.	You met him
2.	He changed your life
3.	You changed his life
4.	He changed the world
5.	The world treated him
6.	He'll be remembered.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Re-deal. Drinks flow. You recall the good times you shared with him:

1.	Getting drunk 
2.	Getting rich
3.	Getting laid
4.	Travelling 
5.	Breaking the law
6.	Doing good. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Re-deal. Night descends. Bitter memories stir, which cannot be left unspoken:

1.	His dark secret
2.	Why you hated him
3.	How he crossed you
4.	How you found him dead
5.	Who murdered him?
6.	Why he deserved it.

Tempers flare. You leave separately, but each return to his grave to leave something: flowers, a ring, a note... or a bladderfull of piss.
