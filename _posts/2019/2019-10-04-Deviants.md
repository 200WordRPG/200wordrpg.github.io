In year 20XY, superpowered people emerged within the society, but society doesn't like them. Your group is made up of several.

You have two stats - Power and Injury. Power is any number between 2 and 11, 11 meaning your superpowers are strongest they could be, but that you suck at other things. Injury starts at 1, +1 for each injury you receive. If it reaches 13, you die. It resets after sleeping for 8 hours.

Everyone picks one thing to control. It must be made up of particles, so fire, biomass, neon, and electricity are okay, but time, life, or force aren't. No two players should have the same powers.

Whenever you need to do a task, roll 2d6 or 1d12. When involving your superpowers in task, you need to roll below Power to succeed. If you can't involve superpowers, you need to roll over Power to succeed. If you roll below your Injury, you fail automatically. When you use your superpowers, describe how. Game Master (GM) must approve your use of superpowers. Follow the Rule of Cool.

GM controls everything else by rules above. Change starting Injury for harder or easier to defeat NPCs. Have fun!

Inspired by Prototype, inFamous, Avatar, and other media where each guy can control one thing.
