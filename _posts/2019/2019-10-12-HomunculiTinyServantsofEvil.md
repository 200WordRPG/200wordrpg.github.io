```
You are homunculi, tiny human facsimiles possessed by dead spirits. You carry out evil deeds of dark magic for your master. You have some faint memories of being human.

Shuffle a pack of cards and draw five each. These represent your memories.

Oldest player starts.

Turn sequence:
- Reveal the top card of the deck. This is the task. 
- Going clockwise players reveal a memory, in suit if possible.
  All memories in suit: highest performs the task. 
  Non-suit memories: lowest non-suit performs the task.
- Resolution:
  Memory higher than task: A good memory, reinforced (place task under memory). While reinforced it cannot be lost. 
  Memory equal or lower: A bad memory, discard it.
  Memory not in suit: A bad memory, discard it and choose:
    - Discard a reinforcement or another memory
    or
    - Give a reinforced memory to another homunculus (explain why it was theirs all along)
- Describe the task and the memories.
- Put discards in pile for reshuffle.
- Active player draws another task to start the next turn.

Game ends when either:
One homunculus reinforces all remaining memories: they break free and escape from the master.
One homunculus loses all their memories: they become a mindless servant of evil, destroying the others.
