 1 player is GM.  
 1+ are DRAGONRIDERS.
 Gather: paper. six-sided dice.

 DRAGONS are corporeal nature-spirits, soul-bonded to a RIDER.  
 This soul-bond grants the rider NATURE-MAGIC.


  ---------- DRAGONRIDERS ----------

 Name your rider. 
 They were: 
    SCHOLAR / PERFORMER / MIDWIFE / ARTISAN / FARMER / EXILE

 Name your dragon.
 They are: 
    GRACEFUL / CAUTIOUS / EMPATHETIC / CLEVER / MASSIVE / FIERCE

 Your dragon's season / rider's spells:
   - SPRING / bloom, rainbow, beast-tongue
   - SUMMER / firefly, thunderstorm, water-breath
   - AUTUMN / frost, mimic, shadow-walk
   - WINTER / drowse, darkness, spirit-speech

 
 ------------- TO PLAY -------------

 Together, choose:
   - EXPLORE the GRAVEWASTES
   - REDIRECT a LEVIATHAN
   - SALVAGE a SKELETON-HULL
   - ESCORT the LUREWITCH

 When you TAKE A RISK or USE MAGIC, roll 1d6. 
   + add 1d6 if your background prepared you for this. 
   + add 1d6 if the action aligns with your dragon's trait. 
   + add 1d6 if you have help. 
 You succeed without cost if the highest die= 5, 6.  
 Else, something goes wrong.  The GM tells you what. 

 When you HARM NATURE, keep tally.  At III, your dragon's spirit returns to the earth.

 When you BECOME HURT, the GM may write something on your sheet.
 This stays unless someone takes action to remove it.


 ---------------- GM ---------------

 Ask questions.
 Introduce obstacles & opportunities. 
 Perhaps:
    spirits / sky-islands / wither-mist / travelers / illusion / fire
    lightning-sheep / curses / artefacts / abandoned-magics / poison / ghouls
