Quiet terror, for one and onlookers

Instruct onlookers that they should not be worried or disturbed by anything they see. You are playing a game and can stop at any time. They must not intervene.

Collect a chair to sit on. It should be from a different room or place, move it into this new context. It is a stranger to this place.

Once it's moved, sit down. Grip the base of the chair firmly with both hands. Wrap your legs around the legs of the chair. Sit up straight if possible. The chair now has a hold of you. You cannot stand up until the game is over.

Next begin to struggle fruitlessly. The chair is holding you down. The chair won't let go. The chair never listens. The chair must hate you. The chair is a spiteful thing. The chair entangles you ever further. The chair keeps you.

No escape.

No hope.

You may attempt to scream, but no sound comes out. Nothing can offer any help. The onlookers will ignore your pleas. You asked them to. You are playing a game, but you are trapped.

Then, suddenly. You may stand. Do whatever you wish to the chair.
