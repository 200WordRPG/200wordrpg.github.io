This game owes a great debt to many others, but especially:
- Into the Odd (http://www.bastionland.com/)
- The Witch Woods and DIE TYRING (https://meanderingbanter.blogspot.com/)
- The Gardens of Ynn (https://cavegirlgames.blogspot.com/)
- Moonhop (https://twogoblinsinatrenchcoat.blogspot.com/)

And to all the palace and castle and estate tours I've ever been on.
