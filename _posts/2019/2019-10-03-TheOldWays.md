Christendom has invaded Westland Isle. You are a creature of lore. If no one believes in you, you cease to exist. Goal: Shake faith of the locals so they continue to cling to the old ways. You can't cause them physical harm, but you can show them what true hell looks like.


Choose a class-selkie, shapeshifting water spirit, +1 dice near water; banshee, wailing harbinger of doom, roll fear to curse a target and succeed on 6+ against them; Gwyllion, ghostly night wanderer, +1 dice to skulk in darkness; sluagh, troublesome restless spirit, +1 dice to fear


Stats: Presence-social, for fear or charm; Skulk-physical, for sneaking or hiding; Insight-mental, for planning and reading opponents. Resolve-dedication to your cause. Divide 3-2-1 between presence-skulk-insight. Resolve starts at 5 and acts like health. Roll dice equal to your stat to perform tasks. 7+ is a success.


Townsfolk start with Fear equal to zero and Faith from 1-6. Insight detects faith and fear, presence attacks them. Townsfolk roll Faith for and against attacks. Fear subtracts from faith, but townsfolk eventually flee from fear. When a townsfolk's faith drops to zero, they become a heathen and deny the mainland's religious influence.

This is my second year participating in the challenge, and my third finished RPG. I am considering expanding this 200 word RPG to a more fleshed out game that's a complete, stand-alone one shot, similar to Lady Blackbird.
