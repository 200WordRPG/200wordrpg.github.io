```
Humans never could prove the existence of supernatural because their pets fight the underworld everyday. You are a pet investigating and trying to stop darkness from destroying humankind. 

Choose a pet species and a name.
Describe the pet and it's background. Choose an extraordinary talent you're known for. You start with a 1d6 Darkness Dice at 1.

If you feel that you can fail at something, roll 2d6: 1-6 you fail; 7-9 you succeeds with a cost; and 10-12 you succeeds. If your background or species gives you some advantage, add 1 do the dice result. If is the case of disadvantage, less 1.

Everytime you find something supernatural or disturbing, roll your 1d6 Darkness dice. If the result is bigger than your actual number, add 1 to it. When you reach 6 you're lost and became a violent crazy killer beast. Create a new character, then. 

Magic can be used and it is connected with your talent, but it costs Darkness dice rolls, everytime. The Dark Plain can be seen when you reach 5 in Darkness Dice. Each game session your Darkness comes back 1.
