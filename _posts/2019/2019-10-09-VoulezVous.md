This is a jukebox musical tabletop roleplaying game.

To start, decide on a playlist-create one yourself, or put an artist, album, or genre on shuffle.

Agree on a setting ("an island off the coast of Greece," "a caf√© in New York City," "a space station orbiting Venus"). Go as mundane or wild as you want, but make sure everyone's on-board. 

Go around the table hitting play on the playlist and listening to one song per player, then pausing. Everyone creates a character, using their song as inspiration.

Play out scenes as these characters.

When you're approaching a turning point for your character, or no one knows what happens next, press play and listen to one song. Don't worry about its literal content if you're not already familiar; focus on the energy.

Sing along. Have fun.

You can begin discussing the song while it's playing, or after. How does it fit into the current storyline? If it seems out of place, how does it actually make perfect sense? Describe visuals, choreography, which characters sing when. Anyone can contribute, but whoever hit play has final say. 

When you have a clear picture of the scene, continue as before.
