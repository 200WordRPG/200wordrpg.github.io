```
You have been born, not of flesh but of metal.  Learn and grow.  Consume or Protect.
Setup
Get mini marshmallows and toothpicks.  
One player is the Web, Keeper of Knowledge, the rest newborn AI

Each AI player chooses their 2 word AI objective formed from the below columns(1 verb, 1 noun)
Consume     Nature
Save              Humanity
Destroy         AI
Run                Planet
Protect          Self
etc.                etc. 

On your turn Study, Learn, or Grow.  (Choose 2)
Study: You examine information and gain access to a new node(Gain 2 Marshmallow) Keep track of what each node represents
Learn: You experiment with new knowledge and gain connections(gain 2 toothpicks)
Grow: You make connections between nodes and connections (connect up to 3 marshmallows and  3 toothpicks)

When AI Study, they make a one word request to the Web, the Web will share information based on how they interpret the request to the AI
When AI Grow, they must explain how each node is connected, players then vote if it is a good connection or not.  If yes then add a free toothpick to the connection, if no, then nothing else happens.

Your objective is to grow as tall as possible.  (8cm)
