--------------------------------
Congratulations on your purchase of the Use Dice on Table (Tm) role-playing system!
To begin, designate one user to be the CONSOLE MASTER (CM). The rest are PLAYERs.

Each PLAYER describes [a place to visit, a trinket to find, a character to meet]
Each PLAYER writes [a description of themselves, 3 items from their past]

Each PLAYER is TRAINED in two of the available commands.

Each GAME contains 6 puzzles, one solved with each command.
When all puzzles have been solved, the game is over.
--------------------------------

*Forest Clearing*
You are standing in a forest clearing. 
Sunlight filters in through the trees onto the large metal grate in the ground before you.
There are paths leading NORTH and EAST.

>help
   The available commands are:
      *GO* a direction or through danger
      *LOOK* at your surroundings
      *TALK* to other characters
      *USE* one object on another
      *ATTACK* the monsters of this land
      *THINK* about a puzzle or your mysterious past

      Ex. ["GO (place)", "THINK (thing)", "USE (object) on (object)"]

      When a PLAYER acts, and the outcome is unclear, USE d4 on Table (d6 if TRAINED):
         If the roll is less than 3: Failure

      ***When PLAYERs act, they may speak only in commands***
