Congratulations!

[PLANET NAME HERE]'s construction is nearing completion, so we've gathered you all to begin evaluation. Most architects work independently, so you may need to introduce yourselves and your areas of expertise. Your individual experiences with the clients may need to be shared as well.

Corporate has created a prototype orbital tracking analysis topographical object, or POTATO. One of you should have the POTATO with you. It is a miniature version of the planet you have been working on all this time.

Analyze the POTATO. Each architect should specify which locations they are most proud of. Does it differ from your home planet? If you have any grievances with other architects, now may be the time to air them. Please let us know if there is anything on the POTATO that you feel was misrepresented, and feel free to mark the POTATO as such.

We only have time left to make one major change to [PLANET NAME HERE], so please inform us what you have agreed upon as the most important fix for the planet. Altering the POTATO to match might be a helpful visual aid.

Best Wishes,
Starch Industries Board of Directors
