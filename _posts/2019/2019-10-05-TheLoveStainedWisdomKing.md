Play as you read.

Imagine someone most perfectly worthy of your lust. Burn in your desire for them. Feel this pain, which is real.

Imagine that all motion ceases in the universe. Imagine that Ragaraja appears before you, in this eternal moment, with his six treasures in his six hands. He will present each and shock you into contemplation, transforming lust into insight.

First is his Bell. Your heart is focused by its sound.
    In what colors do your flames burn?
    By what names are your emotions called?

Second is his Thunderbolt. Your heart is electrified by its power.
    With what sounds do your flames burn?
    By what forms are your emotions shaped?

Third is his Lotus. Your heart is lulled by its serenity.
    In what motion do your flames burn?
    By what dreams are your emotions ignited?

Fourth is his Bow. Your heart is agitated by its majesty.
    Within what limits do your flames burn?
    By what courses will your emotions tamed?

Fifth is his Arrow. Your heart is joyed by its forthrightness.
    From what fuels do your flames burn?
    By what actions will your emotions unleashed?

Last is something you cannot see.

Ragaraja departs.

The game is over.

This is actually an abbreviated version of another game of mine, "stained by love", but the core essence is all here. It's sort of a meditative game about lust and insight, guided by Ragaraja, also known as the Love-Stained Wisdom King in East Asia. All info about Ragaraja that is required to play is in the game(s).
