You are smart wild animals on a tropical island with no big predators or regular human presence, except for some old ruins. Players pick one animal each to represent: bat, capybara, lemur, tortoise, raccoon. All animals can speak to each other, but not to humans. One of you is a game master who plays for environment and humans. 

Recently, humans arrived to your island and started building something. You animals are keen on driving them away!

During night, animal players describe what are they doing to scare away, misguide, sabotage or otherwise harass the humans in their camp. During day, humans go active behind scenes, possibly exploring, repairing or making traps against you!

To succeed at an action, roll 2d6. If you act like an animal, you succeed on 2-7. If you act in a non-animal manner, you succeed on 8-12. Doubles are complications, at GMs discretion. If you get help of another animal or reasonable advantage, you may reroll one of the dice once.

If animals make humans leave, they win. If humans complete their project and bring more humans to the island, the animals lose.
