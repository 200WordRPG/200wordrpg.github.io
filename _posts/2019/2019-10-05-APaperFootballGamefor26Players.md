The players play for an american football team (Quarterback, Receiver, & Defense)

On a piece of easel paper, draw 4 parallel lines to segment the paper into quarters.

Flip a coin to determine which team will start.

The team will have 4 attempts to get the ball past the opposite end of the easel paper (touchdown).

The quarterback will whisper to the receiver what quarter she will try to get the paper football into.

The opposing defense will place her plastic cup into the section she thinks the team will try to throw into.

The receiver will then place her cup into the section her team decided.

If the two cups share the same quarter, they will be placed on their side next to each other.  If they are in different quarters, they will be placed on their side where they are.

The quarterback must try to flick the paper football into the receiver cup.  If it goes into the defense's cup, it is a turnover and the other team plays offense.  If it goes in the receiver cup, play resumes from that point on the paper and that team has 3 more attempts to get a touchdown (7 points).

Rowdy hooting and hollering are encouraged.  Add as much role-playing as you'd like (it is best if the quarterback is yelling snap counts and barking commands to no one).
