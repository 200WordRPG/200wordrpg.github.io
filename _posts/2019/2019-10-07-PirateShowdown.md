```
You're a pirate clashing swords with another sea wolf, however neither of you knows how to wield the steel in your hands, so there's only one option left: bruise each other's honor with words.

You and your opponent take turns clashing as striker and comebacker. The striker randomly opens up a dictionary, chooses at least one word and then must use it in a phrase to praise their own glory and "superior fighting abilities", or simply to hurt the opponent's honor. The comebacker must quickly retaliate, phrasing with any unused words from the already opened dictionary. There's no rejoinder. The pirates just stare at each other and prepare themselves for the next clash.

Players must utter like angry pirates. Whoever reacts out of character (e.g. laughs, is startled, becomes speechless) or is unable to form a sentence, takes one damage point to the honor for each chosen word used by the opponent at the current clash. When a pirate's honor takes three damage points, the pirate loses the game.

If players word prejudice, discrimination, harassment ou hate speech, they lose the game. Actually, they also lose in life

This RPG was inspired by Insult Sword Fighting from the “The Secret of Monkey Island” game.

I also made a more pirateish version, but I was afraid it would be difficult to read. Here it is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uS2QS-hrT8qP8F3yHVS1yoAU3HSM2WhfBxo9dp711CQ/edit?usp=sharing
