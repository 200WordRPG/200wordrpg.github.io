```
Paranormal investigators go into a haunted location (forest, manor etc.) that shifts and changes making it difficult to leave. The only way forward is to find and confront the Evil that controls the location.

Players 

Describe backstory, careers, expertise. 

Roll 2d6 to perform tasks. A 9 or higher is a success. You may get bonuses to rolls based on expertise or circumstance.

Gamemaster

Each time the players move on from a region one player rolls 2d6. If it is a 12, they have found a significant location. Once 3 significant locations are found, they will travel to the Evil on the next turn.

Flavor significant locations and the Evil however you see fit. 

Defeating The Evil

Get creative with the Evil. Encourage players to come up with clever ways to deal with it and give bonuses accordingly.

First, players get a chance at the evil. The evil is defeated when all players roll successes in a turn. Adjust as needed.

If they fail, the Evil gets to go. 

Each player rolls an evasion for the evil. If they fail, they take a permanent -1 penalty to rolls. If they roll a 2 they are killed outright.
