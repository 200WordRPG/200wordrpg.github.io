```
One player says: "Nothing to be done." This begins the scene. All players may then respond with whatever lines they would like from the following list, whenever they would like. They may not say anything not on the list. 

Ah!
Off we go.
Am I?
Over there.
And so on.
Possibly.
And what of it?
Shall we go?
Ask him.
Silence!
Carry on.
So he says.
Farewell.
There's nothing to do.
Help me!
True.
I don't know.
We can't.
I must go.
Well?
I'm going.
What for?
I'm tired.
What is it?
It hurts.
What?
Me, too.
Where?
No.
Who?
Not at all!
Why not?
Not now, not now.
Why?
Not so loud!
Yes.
Nothing.
You think so?

Players may start outside of the scene, entering at their leisure. Players may leave the scene whenever they would like. At some point, a player will say, "Yes, let's go." At this point, all players should be silent for a few moments, and the game is over.
