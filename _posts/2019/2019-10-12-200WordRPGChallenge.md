The Challenge: Pick your favorite dice RPG; play as normal, but choose your words carefully because...
You must vocalize every action/attack that you make, and you can only utter 200 words total! Obviously, be as succinct as possible.

Words count if they are:
- describing an action/attack
- used in dialogue with NPCs

Words don't count if they are:
- anything OOC (table talk, jokes/banter)

Fudge Rolls:
Every time you use n>5 words in a situation, you can fudge the associated dice roll by Â±(n-5). You can do this after the roll has taken place, even causing a crit after the fact!

Fire up the Auto-Canon:
If you use >=20 words, whatever you say is canonically true in-game.

"I shoot the caravan..." (n=4)
**rolls 14** miss!
"...with my powerful and dangerous heavy crossbow..." (n=11, +6)
**roll is now 20** crit!
"...Then the caravan suddenly explodes, instantly killing the corrupt merchants (n=20)
**it happens**

If you utter exactly 200 words with lots of time before the session ends, you can only win if your mute, action-less character survives to the end. Better hope your DM likes charades!
Over 200: you've failed.

Hardcore mode: All spoken words count
