You are a zombie with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. The last humans are holed up nearby. What will you do to eat them?

Required Materials:

1d6

Pen and paper

Buffet Restaurant(or similar source of food)

Setup:

Players create zombie characters by allocating 6 points between two traits, "Dexterity"(the ability to perform tasks beyond shuffling aimlessly) and "Durability"(how many body parts a zombie can lose). After allocating stats, players should grab a plate of as much food as they want and play begins.

Play:

The goal of the zombies is to completely devour the last human stronghold. The GM describes challenges from the environment and the human survivors preventing this. Challenges are rated 1(trivial)-10(impossible). Players describe which trait they use to overcome it and roll the d6. If higher, they may narrate the successful outcome. If lower, they lose a point in that trait and the GM narrates. Players may eat food to add +1 to the roll per bite. Should either trait fall below zero, that zombie is eliminated and the player may create a new one.

Play continues until the humans are eaten or the players themselves are full.

An Indian buffet would be my choice, but the powergamer move would probably be salad place.
