```
You are all a cat. You live in a house with your owner, John. Whenever you declare you'd like to do something, you perform that action unless another player disagrees. All players who are in conflict flip coins. Those who get heads control the actions of the cat. If more than one player gets heads, the cat gruesomely changes to be able to perform both actions simultaneously. The game ends when John can't leave the house.
The narrator controls the house, John, and the consequences of your actions.

You are hungry.
