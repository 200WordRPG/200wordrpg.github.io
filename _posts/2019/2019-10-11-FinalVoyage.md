Year 2122, pollution, global warming, and rapid population growth have planet Earth on the brink of destruction. Over the last century, scientists from around the world have gathered a vast amount of information regarding potentially habitable planets around the universe. However, with most of these planets being so far away, there's no telling for sure how hospitable these new worlds will be to human life. A group of interstellar explorers from different countries and with different skill sets is assembled, they are not the first team to take on this important mission, but previous pioneers were never heard from again. They will navigate the stars on a newly developed spacecraft capable of safely traveling through our known universe, complete with identified galaxies, black holes, constellations, and other wonders and dangers of space. The crew will have to deal with common problems like overcoming mechanical, interpersonal and health issues as well as more serious problems like contamination, mutiny, radiation, meteors, black holes, and many other mysteries of space. The goal of the game is to navigate through space by evaluating clues, avoiding catastrophes, and using the strengths of your crew members to locate and colonize a habitable planet, a new earth.
