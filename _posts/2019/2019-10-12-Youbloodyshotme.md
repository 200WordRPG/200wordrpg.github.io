You bloody shot me!

A drug deal gone wrong. An abandoned building. A gang of bleeding criminals. A bag full of cash.

Each player needs 
-	D6. 
-	Pin.  
-	Balloon full of water.

Look to your left, give that player a "codename" of any object in sight that is their character.

Each player holds their full balloon above the table, this is your Health. At the start of the game each player takes their pin and puts a hole in the balloon of the player on their right, this is your wound.

If a player's balloon empties, they are gone and their dice is removed.

Dice must stay in the middle of the table. To overcome an obstacle, roll all the dice. 
To succeed each dice needs to roll 4+ you can re-roll failures as many times as needed.

Use your free hand to try and cover the hole in your balloon or use your pin to add holes to other players balloons.

If you put down your balloon you can take no actions.

Get out of the building alive with the cash and escape while the GM throws obstacles in between you and the getaway van.
