This is a world building game where the players follow the flow of history as told through questions.
The players take on the role of witches scrying over a single world.
Play requires a magic-8 ball which when used provides random "yes" or "no" style answers with varying levels of confidence.
If the group has a preferred random answer generator, such as an oracle, they may use that instead.

To setup: Each Witch describes who they are, and states a detail about the world in which they all live. This creates a starting point for asking questions about said world.

Each Witch takes it in turn to scry by:
1) Asking a question that could be answered with either "yes" or "no".
2) Obtaining and recording an answer from the magic-8 ball. If the question relates to the answer from the prior question the group may decide to veto up to one nonsensical answer. The scrying witch must agree.
3) Pass play to the next Witch.

Sometimes apparent contradictions may occur. Lean into them. How they get resolved will reveal much about the world being explored.

As with life, these stories may have no end. Play until no longer fun.
