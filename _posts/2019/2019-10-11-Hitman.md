The Hitman is a dangerous assassin that kills their target no matter what. Tonight is a dinner party, there are a lot of guests but two of them are marked for assassination. The guests know ahead of time that the Hitman is coming but they don't know who are the targets. They must find out who is the Hitman and stop him before he'll assassinate both targets.

There would be rooms and all players would be randomly assigned by dice to different rooms each turn. Each room will vote on whether they should kill someone inside or not, and who. Resolve voting stalemates using dice. After the first turn, a card is left in each room. These cards are clues guests can choose to pick up. If the guests collect enough cards, they unveil the Hitman's identity and win. However, the Hitman can lace a card in the same room as him with a deadly poison. Any guest that picks up the poisoned card immediately dies. Only one card can be poisoned at a time, and it stays there until another card has been poisoned.
