Salut! The players are fellow-members of Arté Sophisphicateurs' Societé, whose raison d'être is to be the most vociferous critic in their clique.

Dress artsy-fartsy. Most stylish fellow gets a beret. Each fellow prepares 3 sheets of paper and a pen. Bring extra sheets of paper. Then, visit a gallery/museum!

Beret fellow chooses the first art piece to contemplate. Everyone secretly writes one adjective describing the art piece per sheet of paper they have. After a comfortable while, Beret fellow asks one fellow a question about the piece, who answers and asks another fellow (no asking back!). Repeat ad nauseam.

If another fellow mentions an adjective you have, reveal and strike-out that adjective, preferably with a snooty remark like "How hoi polloi of you!". If no one else has your adjective, tear a tiny piece of paper from the offending fellow . Mentioning your own adjective is a faux-pas.

After 8 minutes or when someone runs out of adjectives, the fellow with most torn paper pieces gets the beret + an additional sheet of paper and chooses the next art piece to appreciate. Repeat until ennui sets in.

Fellow with most torn paper pieces "wins" but everyone thinks they're nonpareil critics anyway.
