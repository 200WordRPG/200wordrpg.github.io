A part of you has been replaced by a mechanical copy. The Company repairs your copies and leave you with massive debts.

Choose which job you do to pay The Company: Espionage, Bodyguarding, Hacking, Assassination, Something Else. You don't want to do this job but it is the only way. For now.

Determine which stat (Awareness, Agility, Might) your copy helps, and which it hinders. The stat your copy helps has 3, the one it hinders has 1. The other stat has 2.

When the outcome of something is uncertain, roll the appropriate stat in d6s. If your job is relevant, add 1d6. If your copy is broken, replace 1d6 with 1d4. If you are wounded, remove 1d6. If you act against The Company, add 1d6.
	See which dice has the highest number. If the highest number is a 5 or 6, you do what you wanted. On a 3 or 4, what you do has cost you or you don't get exactly what you want. On a 1 or 2, you fail. 
If your highest number has doubles, something lucky happens.

The Company thinks that because you're a Copycat, you're disposable. Prove them wrong.
