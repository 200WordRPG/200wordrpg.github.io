The game is played over several rounds, each time a different player is the Employer, the rest Adventurers.

1) APPLICANTS:
In secret, each Adventurer writes a description of a character from any genre, eg:
	Paladin of the Luck God
	Ex-Military Robot Butler
	French Archeologist from 1924

Randomly assign these, ensuring nobody receives their own. Do not reveal them yet.

2) PITCH:
The Employer outlines a Quest, eg:
	Find a stolen spacestation
	Kidnap a dragon
	Become Mayor of London

3) INTERVIEW:
Adventurers announce who they are and attempt to convince the Employer to hire them. When ready, the Employer chooses a single Adventurer who receives 1 point.

4) OPTIONAL QUEST STAGE:
Starting on the Employer's left, each player except the chosen Adventurer:
	a) Describes a problem on the quest
	b) Adventurer says how they solve it
	c) Players who like the solution give the Adventurer 1D6
	d) Adventurer rolls those plus one additional D6
	e) Rolling at least one 5 or 6 beats the problem: Adventurer and Employer both receive 1 point
		
5) Play a new round, until everyone has been the Employer.


 The player with the most points wins, if you like that sort of thing.

Inspired by games like Snake Oil and Mad Scientist University, but putting all the creativity into the players hands and adding a large roleplaying element.
