God: "You stupid f#$@% monks! You drank too much dang wine! You're no longer pure! You've sullied your souls, and must pilgrimage through treacherous terrain to find the Purity Pond and take a cleansing bath!"

*creates beacon of light in the distance indicating location of the Purity Pond*

Monks: "Oh shoot dang -BELCHh, we're gonna be setting off then."

REQUIRES
d4, d6, d8, d20, bottle caps/tokens, friends and beer

MAKE YOUR MONK
4 points divided across the 3 stats
Body for guesses on any physical actions
Mind for guesses on any mental actions
Heart for heartiness

God declares which dice He will be rolling. Bigger dice = Bigger challenge. He rolls in secret to get the Holy Number. If a monk wants to overcome an obstacle, they must guess the Holy Number. Every time they guess wrong, they must take a drink. 

Finish the beer to succeed even after failing to guess the Holy Number.

d20 is for a Group Action; monks guess the same Holy Number together. If anyone repeats a number, they drink twice for not staying focused.  

If failure means getting hurt (like fighting an ogre, or climbing a cliff) then they lose a Heart.

Drink Responsibly

I pray for a future where people chant "Drunk! Monk! Drunk! Monk!" at parties. This game is untested. PLEASE drink responsibly. <3
