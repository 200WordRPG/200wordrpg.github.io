You and your fishin' buddies had a helluva day on the water. Time to brag about your catch!

Choose a BARTENDER (GM). Players are ANGLERS.

ANGLERS start with two coins and a d6.

The BARTENDER will need three coins each in three piles labeled HUMAN, FISH and STUFF.



GEAR

ANGLERS have fancy GEAR. Pick from the below GEAR, two per ANGLER. No repeating GEAR.

Spring-loaded Rod
Captain's Hat
Lifelike Lure
Master Bait
High-tech Reel
Tough Net
Brewski Belt
Braided Line
Tide Chart
Weather Report
Guidebook
Fish Finder
First Aid Kit
10-in-1 Multi-tool
Folded Steel Knife



BARTENDERS - if part of the story seems fishy, interrupt and call for a HUMAN, FISH or STUFF roll. The ANGLER rolls their d6.

Roll equal or lower than the number of coins in the called pile to succeed. 

Remove a coin from the pile on failure. When there is one coin in each pile, the ANGLERS are caught in their lie! 

If an ANGLER uses their GEAR in their action, roll 2d6. 



BUYING BEERS

ANGLERS can add their coins to the BARTENDER'S piles to make rolls easier. 

If the ANGLER'S story impresses the BARTENDER, give that ANGLER a coin that has been removed.
