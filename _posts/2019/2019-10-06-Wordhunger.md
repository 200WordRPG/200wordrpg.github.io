This is a game for two people-myself, and a partner. It should never be played with an empty meal, such as when my partner is a mirror or a photograph.
We'll sit together, you and I, and lock our aching hands together. You can begin. Stare silently into my eyes for as long as you can bear, until words begin to come crawling out of your mouth. Describe me, fully, as what you see before you. You're not here to bolster my ego, or to dig deep against my insecurities. I am your teleprompter. Your tongue shapes me.
Describe my jawline, jutting forward. Describe my skin, stubble bursting. Describe my off-white teeth, my thin gums, my tired hair. Describe my eyes as I listen to you say these words. Describe my tears, describe my smile, describe how I look when I try to look away. Call me what you want. See me. 
With your teeth and lips and alveolar ridge and dagger tongue, tear against my soft skin.
Once you have finished, and you are full of me, I can do the same for you, and we can feast together on what remains.

This game is an old game, and will be included in my upcoming zine Esoteric, that you'll be able to get on my Itch! If you like my weird style of unplayable poem-games, also check out my zines Games For Lost People and Games For The Breakdown.
