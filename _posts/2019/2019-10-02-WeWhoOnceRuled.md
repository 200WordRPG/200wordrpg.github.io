```
You are the last remaining vampires

Materials:
Handmade masks, worn throughout play
Red and black fingerpaint

Take turns clockwise.  The condition of your mask determines your prompt.

Memory (Fresh or Partially Red)
Say:
"I once ruled..."
Describe the decadent power you once held.

The others either respond:
"But now"
Describe how that institution was lost to time, or taken by mortals for their own ends.  Relish their loss.

Or one may challenge:
"But I envied it..."
Describe how they sought to usurp this power.

The challenger and challenged smear red on their masks, revealing simultaneously.  The others point to the reddest mask: this is the winner.  If uncertain, pass to the next turn.

The loser marks their mask with black.

Rage (Completely Red)
	Say to another:
"I have come for you..."
Describe your attempt to destroy them.  They respond.
The others decide a winner and point to them.
The loser must destroy their mask.

Regret (Black Mark)
Say
"I never..."
No one responds
Smear at least enough red to cover your mark.

Twice-Dead (Destroyed)
Do not speak words or take turns (still point).
Walk around, clutching your broken mask, hissing or laughing at those remaining.

End when one remains
