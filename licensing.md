# Creative Commons and You
A
ll entries are protected under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). That means that anyone can remix, modify, expand, or build upon these entries, and even make money off of them! This can include hacks, expansions, adventures, re-skins, and more.

Of course the license does offer some protection for the original creators:

**1.** The work must be attributed and it must provide a link back to the copyright holder.

Not only does this ensure you get credit, but it also lets anyone know who purchases the work that you formed the basis of it. In this industry, name power goes a long way.

For example, Dungeon World was written by Adam and Sage, but it was heavily inspired by Vincent’s game Apocalypse World. Adam and Sage gave Vincent credit for the original game, but they are not required to give him any money or fees for Dungeon World.

**2.** The license protects derivative works and adaptations, not direct copies.

No one can download Dungeon World, change the name to Gungeon World, and then sell it online. The line between “original work” and “derivative work” can be fuzzy, but Creative Commons still protects against blatant plagiarism.

**3.** You have the right to request removal of any content derived from your work. Failure to comply puts the reuse in violation of the license.

This means that at any time you may request that your submission be removed and stricken from the challenge page. You can do the same to anyone using your work for any reason.

**To the hackers and writers out there, play it safe, and contact the original creator to get their permission before you use their work. It keeps things clean and simple.**
