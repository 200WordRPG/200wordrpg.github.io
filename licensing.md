### Why?

The 200 Word Challenge exists to promote encouragement and collaberation. It is NOT a place to find the "best" games in the world. When you submit to the challenge you do so with the understanding that others may re-use your work however they choose, **even for monetary gain**. Don't submit anything you wouldn't want others to use or build upon.

However, there are some huge benefits to submitting your entry under Creative Commons:

### The work must be attributed and it must provide a link back to the copyright holder.

Not only does this ensure you get credit, but it also lets anyone know who purchases the work that you formed the basis of it. In this industry, name power and word of mouth is extremely important.

For example, Dungeon World was written by Adam and Sage, but it was heavily inspired by Vincentâ€™s game Apocalypse World. Adam and Sage gave Vincent credit for the original game, but they are not required to give him any money or fees for Dungeon World.

### 200 Word RPGs are ideas, not products

The chance that your 200 Word Entry is worth thousands of dollars is quite slim. But the chance that someone will see your idea and want to work with or hire you is greatly increased under Creative Commons. Especially for something as small as a 200 Word Entry, the CC License is a great way to get your name out there and meet like-minded designers. 

In fact, you can check out the [Stories]({{site.baseurl}}/stories) page to see those who have turned their entries into larger, marketable games.

### You can build upon cool ideas

Say your entry doesn't generate much buzz. That is a huge bummer, but now you have the opportunity to build upon someone else's work! Go look at some of the incredible entries, reach out to the creator, and build something new from that idea! Just be sure t play it safe. **Contact the original creator to get their permission** before you use their work. It keeps things clean and opens up the possibility of collaberation. 

### No Pressure

If you have a darling idea that will pay the rent and feed your family, **do not** give up on that opportunity! Seriously, go make it big! I wish you all the luck.

But if you are looking to throw a new idea out into the world and see what happens, the 200 Word RPG Challenge is a great place to start.
