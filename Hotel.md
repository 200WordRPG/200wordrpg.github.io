## The Sorcerer Supreme!

```
THE SORCERER SUPREME sets a simple task for the PLAYERS.
They need to invent a SPELL that solves the task.
A SPELL is made of MAGIC WORDS.


No. - WORD - Definition
1 - Si - Trigger
2 - Magnitudine - Size
3 - Morphosia - Shape
4 - Ex-Nihil - Create
5 - Locatia - Location
6 - Emulus - Imitate
7 - Somateria - Object
8 - Injectiv - Insert
9 - Extractus - Extract
10 - Crescere - Increase
11 - Reducto - Reduce
12 - Transmutia - Convert
13 - Preventia - Prevent
14 - Vitalia - Life
15 - Vectora - Kinetics
16 - Luminus - Light
17 - Thermia - Heat
18 - Potentia - Electricity
19 - Chronos - Time
20 - Arcano - Magic

For each WORD in a SPELL, the PLAYER rolls a D20.
Roll - Result
20-16: Critical Success
15-6: Success
5-2: Failure
1: Critical Failure. Roll a D20.
The result corresponds to a new WORD that REPLACES the WORD you attempted to use.

Example
To save a cat from a tree, you try to shrink the tree.
REDUCTO - (Reduce)
MAGNITUDINE - (Size)
SOMATERIA - (Object)
Then roll 3 d20’s
The WIZARD rolls 10-17-2
Reduce (10): Something definitely gets reduced.
Size (17): Size is correctly targeted.
Object (2): Instead of the tree, the cat is selected.
The cat shrinks to the size of a mouse.

Then the next player tries a new spell!

## Familiars RPG

```
You are familiars serving a cabal of witches. You live in the same tower of sorcery. Your goal is to brew a potion during your mistresses’ absence and hopefully impress them. Failure is not an option; they might do something worse than turn you into animals now…
First, roll a die and check the table below to determine the special power you’ve been bestowed. Roll again for your flaw.
One player – the main character (MC) for the scene – rolls for an Ingredient required for the brew and a Location inside the tower. Cross them both off. The player to the right describes complications that arise from the MC’s power, flaw, or both. The remaining players detail the scene and support the MC in getting the Ingredient.
Once the scene is resolved, the player to the right becomes the MC and rolls for another Ingredient and Location. Repeat until all Ingredients are crossed off. Finally, decide together on the result of your experiment.

d6	Power	        Flaw		Ingredient: 	Location
					                Something…	
1	Telekinesis	Gluttony	        …Old		Greenhouse
2	Charm		Cowardice	…Wicked	Morgue
3	Pyromancy	Clumsiness	…Strong		Laboratory
4	Necromancy	Snoopiness	…Alive		Library
5	Invisibility	Selfishness	…Red		Kitchen
6	Teleportation	Recklessness…Weird		Cellar

## MiskatonicU

```
MiskatonicU is a dark-comedy/cosmic-horror RPG set in Miskatonic University. Think “The Breakfast Club” meets “Call of Cthulhu.”

Create classmates by making report cards. Assign two classes to each letter grade (A, B, C, D, and F). Classes can be normal (e.g. Calculus) or bizarre/Lovecraftian (e.g. Fish-People 101). Also, choose a stereotype for your character (nerd, jock, etc.).

Conflicts are resolved by rolling d6 pools. 5’s and 6’s count as successes. More successes = better outcome. Dice pools are based on your grade in the class most relevant to the action:

A=4d6
B=3d6
C=2d6
D=1d6
F=1d6, success only on 6’s
If you have no relevant classes, die pool is the same as F.

Stereotypes add +1d6/-1d6 to dice pools of appropriate actions (e.g. nerd: +1d6 on math, -1d6 on combat actions). A dice pool cannot go below 1d6.

Each character starts with 6 Health and 6 Sanity, tracked by d6’s. A character’s dice pools for physical and mental actions cannot exceed their current Health and Sanity, respectively. Characters die/go insane at 0. 

On an attack, successes = damage. Monsters can also attack Sanity. Opposed actions (e.g. dodging, hiding) are made first and each success removes 1d6 from the opponent’s dice pool. 
```
<hr> 

## The Island of Derring-do

```
The Adventurers Guild was formed when real pros tired of cleaning up the bodies of wannabes. You must pass initiation to join the guild by surviving the Island of Derring-do.

The island is filled with traps, monsters, robot ninjas, former wannabes, and natives sick of strangers destroying stuff.

Shuffle 1 (or more) card decks. Deal 7 cards + 3 tokens to each player. Distribute your cards into 3 “statistics” piles - Mind, Body, Will. Cards have values from 1(Ace) to 13(King). 

Player to your right turns over top card (=difficulty) and describes your challenge. Place 1 token on table and play cards from ONE of your piles that add to more than the difficulty. Describe success. Take cards equal to ½ excess over the difficulty (min 1/max 4). Distribute into statistics piles you DIDN’T use.

Help others by describing aid and adding cards from 1 pile (no token). Only the player who offers the most aid may add cards. On success, take ALL tokens on the table (no cards). 

No tokens left? Can't beat difficulty? Describe failure and discard 1 card.  No cards left = death.

When deck runs out, describe how you use remaining cards to escape the island.
```
<hr> 

## Ladies Night - a game of supernatural romance

```
You play a woman, who is (choose one or two): an exceptional mortal/vampire/werewolf/succubus/witch/zombie/demon/fae/other. Write down your Profession, Weakness and Supernatural Power. 

Other players’ characters are your allies (discuss your relations), you have to solve a mystery together. Supernaturals in the city are your enemies/assets.

Name your Lover: someone you are in love with/fascinated by/obsessed with. This can change later.

Whenever you resolve a conflict (physical, social or mental), roll 2d6. On a 9+ you succeed and catch somebody’s attention. On a 6-8 you succeed, but there is a complication/hard choice/somebody learns your weakness. On a 5- something bad happens and/or you draw unwanted attention. GM decides the outcome.

If your Lover is with you or your Profession is relevant, add +1 (for each) to roll. If your Weakness is relevant, add -1. 

You have 3 Energy. To use your Power, spend 1 Energy. To recharge, you need to: party hard/have sex/hurt someone close/consume something hard to acquire.

The GM makes:
- Lovers unique, fascinating, problematic
- characters wanted, special, important
- supernaturals hungry, unforgiving, attractive.

Together tell the story about romance, sex, mystery, politics and violence.

```
<hr> 

## Valkyrie Girlfriend

```
Valkyries claim the dead. But what happens if you don't completely die?

For at least two players, to be played at appropriate times.

At least one player is a Human, who has had a near-death experience. At least one player is the Valkyrie who came to claim them. The human should decide how they almost died. The Valkyrie should decide why they're attracted to the Human. Roleplay out the near-death scene in a quiet space.

Any time after the near-death scene, the Human and Valkyrie can decide that they are going on a date. This is established by the Human and Valkyrie mutually consenting to a date scene and can happen anywhere, anytime. The Human has access to all of their modern tech and knowledge. The Valkyrie has access to the knowledge and tech of an 11th-century Norse myth. This will probably lead to awkward situations, which is ok.

A player can be Polyvalkyrieous. If they are a Human for someone, they might be a Valkyrie for someone else. Yes, even in the same scene. Confusion will result, that's ok.

Remember to communicate clearly and kindly!
```
<hr> 

## For The Birds

```
This is a game for two or more players, and infinite birds.

Feed birds, who will become characters in your stories. Required for the game are:


Friend(s): a person or people who you can tell stories with.

Feed: at least a couple handfuls of seeds, peanuts, mealworms- no bread! It’s bulky and low in nutrients.

Flock: a duck pond, a city square frequented by pigeons, anywhere where you will be approached by birds.

Get comfortable by the flock, and divide the feed between you and your friend(s). To start play, one of you will toss a handful of feed to the flock. Watch what each bird does, then choose your Main Character and explain their actions;

“That crow ate so quickly because she’s starving after a fight!”

Another player then escalates the story, pointing out another bird;

“With her arch-nemesis: The Starling!”

You get a point for each new bird you introduce as a character! Go as fantastical as you want, a sentence or two at a time- quickly, because the story ends when your Main Character flies away! Whoever has the most points throws more feed and starts fresh. Play ends when all feed has been thrown.
```
<hr> 

## Naming and Alchemy

```
A game for 3 - 5 players.

Each player is an alchemist attempting to learn the “True Names” of the five elements: Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, and Aether. You win by learning all five names first.

Set Up:
One deck of tiles, which make up the board, and a starting tile
One corresponding set of tokens
One deck of material cards

At the beginning of the game, each player draws five cards from the deck of materials and places themselves on the starting tile. 

In a turn, a player can move one space in any direction. If there is no tile on the space where they moved, they draw one from the deck and place it. Each tile has an element and challenge assigned to it. The player must combine the material cards in their hand to beat the challenge. The other players judge if the combination works. If they beat the challenge, they gain a token, and can continue on their way, redrawing the material cards. If they cannot beat the challenge, they move back to the tile they started the turn on. A player learns the True Name of an element by beating five challenges of the corresponding element.

```
<hr> 

## Lacrimae Rerum

```
State a goal you have in this world. Your GM says why you can't achieve that goal immediately. Determine ties, things you like about this world. Could be physical things, concepts or phenomena. 

Try and achieve your goal. Whenever you reach an obstacle, roll a d20 to see if you do it. If you roll greater than your previous roll (above 1 if you haven’t yet rolled) then you overcome the obstacle. If you fail, the obstacle is insurmountable to you, find a different way. 

When your success difficulty reaches 20, or you fail 3 consecutive times, a tie is ‘spent’ and success difficulty is reset. You no longer enjoy that thing like you used to, you’re too exhausted, you just wanna get it done, you just wanna move on. 
If you have no ties left to ‘spend’ you develop a vice and difficulty is set back to 10. This could be anything from an addiction to a bad habit.

When you achieve your goal, you don’t win, you simply did what you were supposed to. The DM gives you two goals now, and you state why you don’t want to do them and playing continues.

Or just stop playing.

```

## Feast

```
PREPARATION
Five Players.
 
Everyone: Choose one basic taste: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, umami.  Prepare food or drink representing it. Each taste must be chosen.
 
Make enough of each food for one bite-sized morsel for every player. Place morsels in the center of the play area.
 
PLAY
1) You are all entities consuming a different individual’s personality. For example: alien parasites, sentient fungi, demons, ghosts.
 
2) Use one food item to inspire your host’s identity.
 
3) Each round, in turns, eat one morsel and recount a memory or thought you consume from your host, related to the flavor you eat.
 
-Sweet: friendship or love
-Salty: personal triumph
-Bitter: regret for one’s own actions
-Sour: sadness about an event or circumstance
-Umami: a contribution to an individual or the world
 
4) Each round, relate your host’s memory or thought…
 
Round 1: …the moment they were infected
Round 2: …they haven’t touched in a while
Round 3: …they shared with someone close to them
Round 4: …they return to repeatedly
Round 5: …they revisit right before their personality is extinguished
 
5) Do not eat the same food more than once. When all morsels are eaten, you have subsumed your host’s consciousness.

## StarFry Adventures

```
Needed: paper, pencil, friends, fries

Welcome, new member of the StarFry collective! StarFry vendors dispense hot crispy starch rods on stations orbiting every world from Omicron to Polaris.

Wash your hands, everyone.

Record your name.

You will excel in your new job with these skills:
Customer Service (taking orders)
Maintenance (cleaning)
Production (frying food)

Fill out your self-evaluation, dividing 7 points between the skills. Each must have at least 1.

Your General Manager will assign you a task. Describe how you do it. He will judge how difficult your action is on a scale from 1-4. Randomly pick a number of fries from a bag equal to your relevant skill. Compare them to fries he draws, equal to the difficulty. If the GM has the longest fry, he will describe how you fail. If you have the longest fry, you have control. Describe partial success with a complication and you may bank one of your fries for later. Consume any un-banked fries.

Your tasks may seem mundane at first but tend to lead to unexpected excitement. While stocking the deep-freeze, Max Moonbottom once discovered a pocket dimension populated by Potatoids! There is never a dull shift at StarFry.

## Your Honored Guest

```
///You gather to celebrate Your Honored Guest.
You feast.
And now you must share your stories.///



{Read the Text aloud as you play.}



{Sit in a circle. Keep the image of Your Honored Guest firmly planted in your mind. Do NOT say Their name. Do NOT describe Their flesh.}



{Starting with the oldest member and moving left, tell a story of Your Honored Guest:
 • When you first met Them
 • When They hurt you, or you Them
 • When They helped you, or you Them
 • When you saw Them last

Focus on how you felt, how Your Honored Guest made you feel. Focus on the picture of that memory. If someone else in the circle was there, you may ask them to help describe it.

If your stories contradict each other, that’s fine. Remember that Your Honored Guest is everyone’s; They don’t belong just to you.}




{When you finish your stories, take a minute to be silent together; write down the names you associate with Your Honored Guest.}




{When you are ready, starting with the youngest and moving right, say the names aloud.}





{When you are done, let your Honored Guest free. 
May They rest in peace.}
```
<hr> 

## The Circle

```
You are a teenaged witch. Give your witch:
a name
a three-word archetype
a preferred sphere of magic

Introduce your witches. You all:
live near each other
are close in age
attend the same high school
You are a Circle; more powerful together than alone. Split the Circle: half Dawn, half Dusk. Sit on opposing sides of the space; you are united in aims, divided in methods.

As a Circle decide:
what big magic you are planning
what preparations you must complete
what complications are in your way

Remove the Jokers from a deck of cards. Shuffle it. Put it in the center of the space. Taking informal turns, narrate what your witch think, feels, and does.

When you narrate something with an uncertain outcome or that uses magic, pick an opposing player and draw three cards. If it reinforces your archetype, draw an extra card. If it involves magic within your preferred sphere, draw an extra card. Choose and reveal three cards:
three black: you narrate the outcome
two black: you narrate the outcome; they narrate a complication
two red: they narrate the outcome; you narrate an advantage
three red: they narrate the outcome
Shuffle after each draw.
```
<hr> 

## Highlighter Maze Runners

```
One player is the maze master and draws a dungeon on a sheet of paper.  Hex or grid paper is excellent for this.

Indicate start and finish.

## Ultimate fantasy (or is it?)

```
This is a 1 or 2-player game in which you get to play out having a harem full of beautiful partners.

Write down between 6 and 99 (your choice) names of the people in your Harem. Add the most valuable trait and the dominant vice of each. Now roll D6 for each to establish their starting Affection. Create as many details as you want. Your Harem is now complete.

You start with 3 Energy. Each turn pick partners (pay 1 Energy for each) and narrate the time spent with them. They get +1 Affection. 

Roll a D6 for each person not in the scene above. On 3- their Affection lowers by 1. 

Each even number rolled means, their vice got the better of them. Explain how you deal with this or their Affection lowers by 1. 

If anyone’s Affection reaches 0, there’s turmoil. Each turn, her/his Affections equals 0, everyone else lowers Affection by 1.

Each time anyone’s Affection reaches 6, explain how their valuable trait makes your Harem a better place.

You can regenerate your Energy by spending one turn in solitude.

In the 2-player version, you act out the scenes, and the second player controls the Harem.
```

## Let Me Live

```
Let Me Live
You will need at least four players. One of you is The Judge.

Something terrible happened.
You don't know what it is, but now, all together you seems stuck in this small white room.
In front of you, there is this human being, he's not like you. He's wearing a badge where you can see his name : The Judge.

The judge is asking you : who are you and why should I let you come back down there ?
Every one of you has to answer his question. 
When it's done, he continue : There's only one of you I can bring back to life. Show me one of your memory so I can tell if you deserve to live again.
Every one of you has to do as he told.
When it's done, The Judge decide. Everyone win except one of you.

Rules : 
Choose randomly the first to speak and then play turns clockwise.

Purpose : to think about what matters in life.

```
<hr> 

## Momento

```
Momento
Everything has a past, stories are what give them history. In Momento you play as an object. Something that can fit in a pocket is best. Working with others, you will give it a story.

Setup Phase
All players take their object and set it in view of the other players. You then take turns introducing your object. Pay attention to what others say about their objects.

Once all the items are introduced, the player with the largest object picks a theme. The player with the smallest object picks the mood. Use that theme and mood to help give a setting to your story.

Storytelling Phase
Working together, the players find the story of how all of the objects met one another. This is a collaborative exercise. Players then take turns telling that story from the perspective of their object.

Scoring Phase
Give all players voting slips equal to the number of other players. Write S on one, and T on another.

Give the S to the player whose object you liked the story of the most.
Give the T to the player who told the best story about your object.

The player with the most S/Ts wins.

## Incandescent War

```
In the beginning there was only Light, and then with a sudden implosion, Darkness grew and spread, leaving only pinpricks of Light to defend itself. In order to defend itself, the Light found a way to create Life.

You are an Incarnation of Life, the first made, in one of its most glorious myriad of forms. Your job is to stand against the forces of Darkness, so that life may flourish.

To do this, you have been given the ability to shift your form as you wish to be able to counter whatever it is the Darkness sends against you.
 
The System:
This is a pure battle of wits, where the players decide on what the limitations are to the battle, to what will be the end, and then determine who goes first.

The first one chooses a form, and then gets to attack. Unless you are able to come up with a counter to that form, you will take damage.

Damage is dealt in the form of the victor choosing if they want start or respond in the next round.
Once damage is dealt, forms reset and combat starts anew.

## Mother nature called

```
When pollution in the world ran rampant, when everything looked bleak and mankind was short of destroying itself, something happened. Nobody had an explanation for the phenomenon, but most people attributed the change to mother nature. 

There has always been a spirit animal in each of us and when it surfaced, modern life with its luxuries, technology and productivity lost its meaning. Mankind was not returned to primal urges, but returned to a simpler life — closer to their spirit animal, to their environment and nature. Thousands left the cities, left their homes, came together in tribes, sharing common character traits that were brought up by different animal spirits.

The tribes living in the same area came together every full moon to discuss important things and problems. These gatherings were considered sacred. You are the spokesman of your tribe. 

Describe what spirit animal you have and what common trait your tribe shares. 
Then everybody thinks of a problem for the player/tribe left of him. 
Discuss the problems and find solutions. 
Think as a human but highly influenced by your spirit animal. 
You want to solve your tribe’s problem but not at the cost of other tribes. 
```

## Order of St. Aloysius

```
In "The Order of St. Aloysius," each player controls a monk who attempts to live through a year while staying holy.  Each monk has four virtues (Humility, Kindness, Diligence, and Temperance) and a name.  Each player assigns the numbers 1, 2, 2, and 3 to their virtues.  All virtues are public information.

Every season, players go around the table five times, posing a single Problem to the player to their left each time.  Problems can either be External or Internal.  Every SEASON, players can only respond to as many External Problems as their Kindness, so they may choose to skip Problems.  Similarly, players can only respond to as many Internal Problems as their Temperance.  Players describe how they solve a problem, then gain victory points equal to their Humility.

Players can choose to Pray instead of responding to Problems; they can do this as many times per YEAR as their Diligence.  Players who Pray skip their turn but shift the Problem to the next player. 

During the second and forth season, the order of play reverses and players pose problems to the player on their right.

At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points wins.

## Dice Mafia

```
Everybody is different. Sometimes you need to look past the face and into the mind to see what potential a person has. Sometimes, you need to do the exact opposite.

Players are Mafiosos, all vying to become the next Godfather. Each player gets assigned a Weapon, a Hideaway, and a Buff. Each Mafioso has five health. Each turn, that Mafioso chooses another one to "erase". Attackers use their Weapon dice and defenders use their Hideaway dice. Resolve Buffs. Whoever rolls lower loses one health, then play passes. In a tie, both players lose health. Once one Mafioso is left standing, they win. Discussion, networking, alliances, rivalries, and grudges are encouraged, since creating a family to do your bidding and to eliminate competition is what being a Godfather is all about.

Weapon Examples
D8+1
D10
2D4

Hideaway Examples
D12
D10+1
2D6

Buff Examples
Attack get +1
Rolls get +2 at 1 Health
Pass Turn to Heal 1

All dice, numbers, and stats are totally customizable. For high-octane combat, consider having strong Weapons than Hideaways and offensive Buffs; for longer, strategic games, consider setting Weapons and Hideaways about equal, and add in Buffs that preserve health.

First-to-3 series are encouraged.
```

## Crazy Conversation

```
OBJECTIVE:
Players take turns trying to get another player to say specific words in a specific time or go crazy.
PLAYERS:
3-8
GAMEPLAY:
First player is player with the oldest phone then proceeds clockwise.
Active player rolls a D6 to determine how many words player to the left must say.
Player to the right determines the words in the conversation by writing them down and handing to active player. (words in English Dictionary)
Active player has two minutes to produce results with either questions or statements to illicit desired response from the player to his left. (player to the right is deciding judge and keeps count)
If successful, players not involved in the conversation lose XD6 collectively from sanity, where X represents the number of words originally assigned, with active player assigning dice as they see fit, where total number of dice assigned equals X.
If unsuccessful, active player loses XD6 from sanity, where X equals the number of words originally assigned.
Starting sanity is based on desired times of game. Once a player is insane, still in the game but has developed OCD and must hear every word three times.  Last player with sanity left is the winner.

## Final Enemy/A Poetry of Revenge/Samurai Haiku

```
None have ever seen the face behind the mask of the Demon Shogun, the mysterious noble who destroyed your lives.

A rebel cabal gathers at the Shogun’s Fortress to find justice. Each conspirator formally introduces themselves. 

In turn, describe how The Demon Mask wronged you, and why you have failed at getting revenge. Your tale should highlight your amazing abilities, while showing the incredible powers and supernatural strengths of your nemesis.

While each speaks, the others compose a Haiku about the tragic tale. Fold the completed poem and silently place it in front of the speaker. Once all have their poetry of revenge, you begin to discuss strategy. How can we defeat the Immortal Demon?

One will stand, laugh heartily, and don the horrific mask - revealing themselves as The Enemy.

The Shogun unfolds and reads a Haiku aloud, solemnly.  Then, using the Haiku as their inspiration, The Demon narrates their attack against the rebel who wrote it.  That Hero responds in kind, reading a random poem to inspire their narration of their own death.

Repeat this ritual until only one remains, the Hero destined to slay the Demon. 
Read all your poems then narrate your legendary victory.
```
<hr> 

## Come up with a catchy title after playtesting

```
Your turn, roll to hit. Enemy’s turn, roll to dodge. What if you want to wait for an opening? Make a powerful attack at the cost of a windup? Emulate the beautiful tension of dodging a blow at the very last available second?

Action games measure time in “frames.” Windups, damage windows; a dodgeroll grants invincibility frames, but leaves you open for just as many. These mechanics make Dark Souls exhilarating. Smash Bros competitive. Why fighters EXIST.

Let’s not measure Turns, but Tenths (of a second). An Ogre gets the jump on Tim and Dave, begins to windup: 7 Tenths. Tim notices, stabs swifty- weakly, but only 4 Tenths- leaving enough time to Guard. Dave took a Tenth to react, so he waits... one Tenth... two Tenths... then ducks, followed by a Slash before the Ogre's lifted up his club. Tim finishes defending but spends a Tenth to listen- swore he just heard the drawstring on a bow...

You keep track of this with a Timeline. Everyone acting is on it, and the Tenth they can act, they must decide. Once you commit, it gets placed on the timeline, and there's no backing out until it's complete (or interrupted).

## The Quest for the Object of Desires

```
Players are on a quest to find a mystery item of many forms that fulfills wishes. Each player chooses one from each of these categories when creating a character:
Skills: Force, Magic, Charm
Traits: Will, Dexterity, Influence
The game leader then determines the location of the item. Players take turns declaring an action that moves them closer to their goal, with each action being unique, and rolls 1d6 to determine if the action is successful. The die roll needs to be above a 4 for the action to be successful. If the player has 3 unsuccessful rolls in a row, the player dies on their quest.
The game leader determines the skill and trait categories for the action. If the action matches the player’s skill category, the player rolls an extra d6, with only one die needing to be successful. If the action matches the player’s trait category, the player needs to roll above a 3 instead for the action to be successful.
The first player to have 5 successes without dying or the last player alive wins.

## Ummenbach

```
Needs 4 players, deck of cards. 
Split the card piles in 4 piles (hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds) between players, draw away the jokers. 
All players consider a family of three characters and make a simple background for each. Match each character to king, queen, and jack. Consider which layer of medieval society your characters belong to, what their ambitions are, and what they would do with infinite power. 
All players raise the card representing the leader of the family with the backside facing the other players. In turn, present the card and name the character. 
In turn, each player can attack another character. Attacker and attacked player choose between 1 and 2 cards from the rest of their card pile, describe their attack, and compare numeric values. If attacker has the higher value, the attacked character is removed, and the next family leader is revealed. Otherwise, repeat with next player. 
When no more players have cards with which to attack, shuffle the rest of the characters together, and put two jokers in the pile. Draw 2 cards. These cards represent the power couple, marrying for the betterment of all. The players who own these characters win. Jokers don’t count.

## Happily Ever Maybe

```
You are a magic fairy! Describe your looks, name, temperament, and your one simple magic ability. 

Together, your fairy team must help one poor peasant achieve their happy ending in a classic fairy tale setting!

Each player gives one character element about the peasant and two details that would make the peasant’s life better. Count out red d6s equal to the number of happy ending details the group described. Do the same with white d6s. Place all dice in a bag. 

The oldest fairy begins the game. Declare how you wish to help the peasant with one of their details. Draw from the bag. A white die means success; a red means failure. Narrate the outcome. 

Pass the bag left, choose a new detail and draw again.

If you draw two red in a row, the peasant is physically harmed. Draw three and they die. Describe how.

When you have drawn all the WHITE dice, your peasant get’s their happily ever after, but draw all the RED dice and they don’t. Describe how.  

At the end of the story, have each fairy give one part of an epilogue describing a good or bad ending as represented by the dice.

## Daffodils for William

```
Once you had a dear friend, William, but now he is gone. This is a game about remembering for two to five people.

You can play this game on a warm, sunny day in a backyard or a public place outdoors. If possible, play in a local graveyard that is open to visitors. Try to find the grave of a William who has been dead for at least 50 years to sit by. 

Someone should bring food, and someone should bring cut flowers. If possible, someone should bring a picnic blanket.

Have a picnic and take turns telling stories about William. Talk about how your friendship with William changed you and why you will miss him. Be sure to mention when you met William and the last time you saw him. When you finish a story lay a flower on William’s grave. 

Continue until you run out of food or flowers or the weather changes and you need to go inside.

## A Matter of Time

```
The GM is fate, the players are seers.

Decide the setting. Time travellers vs AI? Oracles racing to stop Ragnarok? Cyberpunk Greek warriors vs the reawakened Cronus? Anything can work as long as the characters have a reason for seeing the future.

Characters have three ratings: Will, Power, Skill. Divide 8 points between them. No rating can be higher than 5.

The GM sets the scene, describing it as if all threats succeed. Play then begins prior and the players can react to the future as they saw it. Character actions are assumed to automatically succeed unless an intrusion is made.

Every time characters alter the stated future, the GM gets an intrusion die. Intrusion dice can be spent to make an enemy react differently than previously stated or introduce a new element to the scene in current time. Roll. If the result is greater than the appropriate stat, the character fails.

Characters may collectively choose to accept their fate for a round. Accepting failure removes half the intrusion dice from the GM’s pool

Play continues with the GM describing the result of each round before the players have a chance to alter it until a conclusion is reached.
```

## Death Metal

```

You play a Death Metal band:

Characters include; Singer, Guitarist, Bassist and Drummer.

Singer gets a d12  
Bassist gets d4s
Guitarist gets d6s
Drummer gets d10s

Start with two monsters.

The Singer rolls a d20 and hands out dice to members of the band in any combination where the number of dice adds up to the number rolled. 

The band may roll each dice in any order, if the total goes over the hit points of the monster, it dies and subtracts one from all future d20s rolled, this accumulates. Two new monsters appear. 

If there are hit points left, Monsters may be combined with one new monster to make a monstrosity which combines the hit points of the two monsters.

If the band's rolls equal the hit points, the monster dies. 

The Singer rolls again when all dice are used up. If Singer's roll is 0 or negative, the game ends. Total monster destruction at anytime ensures the next tour, otherwise glorious death!


d8 Monsters and Hit Points;
1 Headless Bat 20
2 Cannibalistic Corpse 30
3 Succubus 40
4 Whores of Babylon 25x2
5 Lying Xes 40x2
6 The Unnamed 90
7 Doubt 100
8 Iron Man 120

## You're a Werewolf but it's Not a Full 
Moon

```
Your first full moon was rough, but your second felt...good. The transformation, strength, freedom, the connection to nature and friends, the songs.
It's a new moon now and you and a packmate miss the full moon. Get together over seven days to remember.
Sunday, you change: Change something about your outfit, makeup, appearance.
Monday brings strength: Destroy something. Shred some paper. Snap a branch.
Tuesday, celebrate your wild nature: Do something you've never done before. Big and important or small and minuscule- No one's watching but the moon.
Wednesday reminds you of the forest: Lay in the grass. Take a walk. Reconnect to nature.
Thursday is spent with your pack: Let your packmate know you appreciate them and will protect and support them. You're in this til the last hunt.
Friday night is a celebration: Howl and sing with your packmate. Pick a song you both love or write something new and untamed.
Saturday, you change back: Return to human form. Replace what you changed about your appearance at the beginning of the week.
The next full moon comes in a few weeks. Lycanthropy or not, every experience is transformative. You're not the same wolf you were this morning.

## Among powerful wizards and sorceresses

```
One artifact per player, it can be everything. 

Each player must tell, within six minutes, the story about how he/she got it. At the end of each story others pick two (may be twice the same one) gems between anthracite, jade, cinnabar, citrine and sapphire. 

Each gem has it own signification :

anthracite: philosophical choice, redemption by reason, ataraxia

jade: travel, discovery, night

cinnabar: violence within creation, creation within violence, madness

 citrine : power of the greatest number, society, arbitrary judgement

 sapphire: indecision, knowledge, tribut

Note those numbers and gems for each player story. 

Once everyone told a story, the one with the biggest gems variety (A) and the one with the highest score in one particular gem (B) are finalist. If draw, chose the player with less variety. If equality again, “A” choose. 

Final :    “A” and “B” must convince, or persuade, non-finalists in a five minutes speech to choose he/she as the new archimage by telling his/her first magical deed. “A” must only use theme linked to “B” most represented color and “B” must use at least one theme linked with all “A” gems.
    
    Non Finalists elect the new archimage after deliberation, yet finalists can’t talk anymore

## Dragon Tag

```
In this LARP players are unimpressive dragons who are aggressively hording minor objects.

1). Each player chooses a color of dragon and makes a note of it.
2). Each player spreads out in the general area of play, chooses a secretive spot for their horde, and places a note there with their dragon color.
3). Play starts when all players have chosen their horde locations and have met back up.
4). During the game, players will scatter throughout the area, finding things to add to their horde. 
5). If a player is carrying something in their hands and gets tagged by another player, they must drop that thing unless it matches their dragon’s color.
6). If a player finds another player’s horde he can steal any items from it that match his color and do not match the color of the person who owns the horde.
7). After 10/15/20 minutes of play the timekeeper will call time and the game will end. Each player will bring their horde back to the starting area (or direct everyone to their horde, if necessary) and the player with the coolest horde, as determined by the other players, wins.

## 5 ways to win without fighting (a supplement)

```
Intimidation: If your foes value their lives and you show them, or trick them into believing, they are weaker, they will flee or surrender rather than die in vain.
Threatening what they value: Foes may value more than their lives, such as families, treasures, a fortress or a home. If you are able to put those in danger, your foe will retreat to protect them.
Bargaining: Your foes’ goals may not conflict with your own. If you are able to offer something they desire (even a better enemy or safety from a greater foe) they may respond in kind.
Misdirection: If your foe believes you threaten them where you do not, and are not where you are; you may circumvent them.
Dissention: Unless your foes are automata, each will think differently than the other. Look for the disgruntled, the ambitious and provoke them to action.
Some basic principles to follow:
Check your own, if one amongst you does not wish to use strategy then it cannot proceed.
Know your foe, to understand to which strategies they will respond.
Know yourself, what strengths you have and what deceits you can employ.
Know how to communicate, whether to bargain or to threaten.

## SwordBearer's Dirge

```
On the coldest winter night your clan was destroyed. You and a few others fled, swearing revenge; you want to take your clan’s heirloom, the sword Ennustama, to your allies’ in the South.

Build Pools by distributing 5 points between Brutality and Deception.

Pick one Role: Assassin, Guard, Noble, Spy-Master, Torturer. In conflict you get 1 point if your Role comes into play.

Pick one Aspect: Arrogant, Bloodlust, Callous, Sadistic, Selfish. Roleplay your Aspect to replenish a Pool.

Choose who is SwordBearer, and start the story. In order, play the escape, the village, the tundra, the haunted forest, the arrival.

1 - Player narrates what happens; others add details. 
2 - Any player can interrupt to start a conflict. 
3 - Interrupted player spends from a Pool and narrates the conflict, or cedes narration to the interrupting player, who then continues. Proceed to 1.

Conflict against revolted peasants, enemy soldiers, cold spirits, snow leopards, avenging ghosts, weather, hunger or lost.

If SwordBearer, Ennustama praises and awards 1 point in conflicts. If not, Ennustama taunts, promising 1 point if you attack SwordBearer. At any time, make an attack on SwordBearer. Both spend how many points they wish, winner becomes SwordBearer and narrates, loser dies.
```

## Splice

```
In the Sacred Laboratory, conflict is inevitable.
  Players: Splicers
  Cards: Genomes
  Jokers: Wild
 
Requires:
  d6
  Standard deck

Splicers dealt seven starting Genomes
Remaining Genomes are “Feral”  
 
Two phases: “Hunt” and “Lab”

Hunt
  Splicers make a pile of seven Genomes, placed face down
  Feral Genome revealed from deck
  Feral determines hunt location…
    (Hearts/Mutagenic Forest, Diamonds/Icy Tundra, Clubs/Desolate Ruins, Spades/Cursed Wasteland)
  Declare Hunters
  Five Genomes flipped from deck, added to Feral hand.
  Hunters each roll d6, remove this many cards from the top of their Genome pile, and place on the bottom.
  Hunters draw top five Genomes, compare with each other and best 5-card Feral hand (as Poker Hands). Highest Splicer claims the Feral. If Feral highest, it escapes.
  Splicers not Hunting may trade a Genome for a random replacement

Lab 
  Splicers may trade Genomes
  Splicer with most Genomes may be accused of heresy (combat with accuser as per a Hunt). Other Splicers may loan a Genome to either combatant after die is rolled but before Genomes are revealed. Losing Splicer banished, their Genomes become Feral

Game ends when a Feral is unable to make 5-card hand (most Genomes wins), or only one Splicer left in lab unbanished.
```
<hr> 

## The Creation

```
Each player’s character awake as a consciousness in a void, aware of only the other characters. They are the primordeal spirits and gods in a universe just born. They must choose their character’s Essence; a quality, activity or phenomenon, i.e. love, wisdom, mischief, war, harvest. Then choose character name.

The characters receive an Imperative (from the Divine Force that created them) to create sentient life, including the necessary habitats (e.g. planets). Let the players play, it doesn’t have to resemble our universe. Delve into detail, especially with life and sentient beings; what do they look like, how do they function, are they sociable, how do they survive, etc.

When sentient beings have been created, the characters must (by imperative) teach them their Essence (love, wisdom, mischief, etc.) in whatever way they choose. You may also investigate how the beings relate to the gods (characters); prayer, offerings, rituals, or not at all. 

Plot device: if the GM decides so, sentient beings may be able to send thoughts to gods they know about.

RPG system: the GM chooses outcomes that drives or creates stories.
```
<hr> 

## Operation: Doomed

```
This is a game about competent people, in a situation that’s well beyond their capabilities. It requires several d6 per person, preferably of similar sizes, and a stable surface.

Every player except the GM plays a Special Operative. They get a pistol, knife, flashlight, and any three of the following: rifle, first aid kit, body armor, extra ammo, utility gear, extra batteries. The mission is simple: investigate and retrieve what lies at the heart of the target zone at all costs. The crux is, it’s no case of mere murder and crime. As increasingly demented and monstrous people attack them, the nigh-immortal Beast will begin relentlessly hunting them down.

It’s not a game about winning. It’s about surviving however long you can, and making the best of a hopeless situation.

Action resolution is handled by stacking dice. The GM decides the difficulty, which adds 1-3 dice to your tower. If it falls, you roll every die from the tower and add them together.

 2-9   	expend an item. Panic if no items
10-18  	panic: can’t act for the rest of the scene
19-28  	injured: add +1 to action costs
29-39  	dying: roll +2d6 when tower falls
40+    	death

```
<hr> 

## The Tavern at Dungeon Level 200

```
One player is a monster that arrives at the dungeon tavern.  (Describe yourself!)  The other players are waitstaff.  Choose your class (Bartender, Cook, or Server) and your species.

The monster shows up to the bar or get a table and orders a drink or dish, but some ingredient is unavailable.  (A Cook chooses.)  

The remaining players go to recover what’s missing; inevitably it’s available in somewhere in the dungeon.  Where?  Roll 2d6 and choose one:

1)	Mushroom Forest
2)	Flooded Cavern
3)	Catacomb Keep
4)	Clockwork Labyrinth
5)	Slimy Sewers
6)	Lava Hellpits

The monster takes three tokens, plus one for each other player.

When the group goes somewhere or does something, they automatically succeed unless the monster player uses a token to add a challenge.  Any player can attempt to overcome it, but if you just rolled for something, let someone else go.  If it’s something your training as a bartender/cook/server would help you with, roll 2d6 keep highest; otherwise, 1d6.

1-3:  It goes wrong
4-5:  You do it, but…
6:  Success!

After the last challenge is overcome, the team returns to serve the dish/drink.  How does the monster like it?
```
<hr> 

## Hidden Faces

```
Requires: Pack or two of cards ~4 players.

Sit in a circle, split cards evenly, cards in hand are secrets.

Begin play by stating your name and revealing a secret; putting a card face up in front of you.

Heart: A relationship of some kind
Diamond: A goal or dream
Spade: A philosophy or belief
Club: A fear or worry
King: Relates to player left
Queen: Relates to player right
Jack: Relates to player opposite

When someone reveals a secret, another player may say how it interacts with one of their face up cards, then turns over that card.
When someone turns a card face down, another player may say how that card interacted with their card and turn it face down.

Play ends when a player has all their cards face down or no player can play a card or turn a card facedown.

Optional: Add jokers, they change the meaning of one of your face-up cards.

## Before Bedtime

```
You are kids going to bed. Decide who starts.
Roll 1d6 to see where the monster comes from:
1. Under the bed.
2. The closet.
3. Through the window.
4. Under the blanket.
5. Inside the pillow.
6. Under the rug.
The player on your right rolls 1d6 secretly for the monster's hit points and another 1d6 for weak spot:
1. Head.
2. Tail.
3. Hands.
4. Feet.
5. Heart.
6. Navel.
Choose a toy:
- A teddybear. One hit, 1d6 damage.
- A slipper. Two hits, 1d4 damage.
-A spade. Three hits, 1d3 damage.
- A stormtrooper. 1d2 hits, 3 damage.
- A car. 1d3 hits, 2 damage.
- A pillow. Infinite hits, 1 damage.
Kids have six hits. Toys can be used their hits times before breaking. The kid narrates the attack. If it hits the weak spot, double the damage. Monster attacks with 1d6. The kid defends with 1d6. If the numbers are same, the attack is blocked. Otherwise the kid suffers two damage. If the toy breaks, another can be chosen. After each battle, the turn goes clockwise. If in the end the monsters have won more than the kids, they take over the World.

## Power Chord: A Musical RPG

```
The players are musician-mages, trapped to amuse the music gods in a carnival at the end of time. They must persuade deities to help them and will occasionally be set to fight one another in the arena.

Each player chooses a start playlist of 30 songs, no more than 10 from any genre. They pick one music genre to gain a power bonus on.

Before a battle, players each listen to a randomised playlist song. They may call “attack” or “call” on up to five lyric lines. In either case they write the lyric-spell on a card. Attack cards/spells may be used next battle only, as attacks or counterattacks. Calls may be used anytime outside battle. Calls on instrumentals give power cards that can boost either variety of cards.

Battle example of card plays:
P1: Attack with: “Sweet dreams are made of these”
P2: Counter: “I am the Walrus”
GM: “Attack is a sleep spell - walruses still sleep so it’s a poor counter. P2 successfully turns themselves into a sleeping walrus.”

Battle wins may give extra cards per song, special cards, bonus chosen genres, etc. Plot aims may include escaping the arena, gaining a deity’s favour, etc.

## Kaiju Glory: a narrative citystomp

```
Requirements:
Bocce Balls
Open Space
Kaiju Cosplay
Play begins: The Kaiju team throws the Pallino, and declares the Building that it represents.
The City team Places a ball no closer than three steps to the Pallino and narrates how they’re defending the Building.
The Kaiju narrates their plan to destroy the defenses, and throws a ball.
If it lands closer to the Pallino than the City's ball, his attack is successful. Further away, the City narrates how the defenses held the Kaiju back. If it is too close to tell, approach the play area, and measure it out with stompy feet, in the Kaiju style.
Whichever team is NOT closest to the Pallino narrates a reaction, throwing a ball. If this ball becomes the new closest, they’re successful, otherwise, they continue to throw until they’re out of balls. When they’re successful, play switches to the other team.
Once all the balls are thrown, whoever has the ball closest to the Pallino describes the saving or the destruction of the Building. Players become whatever team they weren’t on before, and a new round begins. After 4 rounds, the Kaiju returns to the ocean, and the city is quiet, UNTIL NEXT TIME…

## DOGMA

```
You and at least two others (there is no maximum) are an entire religion, throughout its timeline - from inception, to corruption and subversion.

Your religion is growing. It will do great things... Before it is twisted, and made rotten. We play to see it fester.

The first player describes a moment of SPIRITUALITY: a fact about the religion at its founding. 
//Thou shall not kill.

The second describes a FABLE that explains it: written long after, it obscures the spirituality from morality into rote learning. 
//St. Cain didn't kill the sinner, but cut off their hands, feet and tongue so they could never sin again.

The third describes a MISINTERPRETATION: long after the fable is written, how is it subverted and corrupted for personal gain? 
//King Auger cut out the tongues of all non-believers, stating they were now, or would become, sinners. He declared their exsanguination was God taking their deaths into Her own hands.

A player who hasn't described a Spirituality begins again. New Spiritualities must reference or retaliate to a previous Myth or Misinterpretation.
//Suffer not the sinner to live.

The religion stagnates when everyone has misinterpreted something.
//Religion fades when spirituality is forgotten.

Record everything.

## ARM-WRESTLING: THE RPG

```
This RPG is about an ARM-WRESTLING tournament and requires at least two players and a GM. The players play ARM-WRESTLERS who intend on getting first place.

The group should have at least two normal sets of dice.
Characters have six TECHNIQUES: Strong, Twisty, Sneaky, Sticky, Wicked and Demeaning. The players should take each die from a normal set and write it next to their technique. A d20 in a technique is awesome and a d4 is bogus.

Example:
Strong: d12
Twisty: d8
Sneaky: d20
Sticky: d10
Wicked: d4
Demeaning: d6

When an ARM-WRESTLE begins, the players decide which technique to use. They take the die assigned to that technique and, at the same time, SPIN the dice. The one whose die spins the longest is the winner of the ARM-WRESTLE. 

The players can also ARM-WRESTLE NPC's, in which case the GM picks a random die and technique.

Once you've used a technique, you are too exhausted to use it for the rest of the day. You may regain it by BANTERING with someone, which is like ARM-WRESTLING except that you regain a technique if you win and only lose the die you use if you lose.

## The Council

```
You are The Council.  Masters of Reality and followers of the GodKing.  Tragically, the GodKing has been slain.  The Council must elevate a new GodKing.  However, one of your number desires to be GodKing, and fearing opposition, has decided to destroy The Council.

Each player chooses an Archetype of Reality(Death, Life, Pain, Joy, etc.) that they represent as a member of The Council. 

Randomly determine the Betrayer and, if desired, Minions of the Betrayer.  

Starting with the youngest individual, players explain their Archetype and why they would be the best GodKing.  Other players may interrogate the active player to determine if they are the Betrayer.

After all players have spoken, hold a hidden vote to elevate, or destroy, an Archetype.  If a majority of the players vote either to elevate, or destroy, an Archetype that actions occurs.

If an Archetype is voted destroyed, that player is removed from the game.

If an Archetype is voted elevated, that player is now GodKing and the game ends.  

If no GodKing is chosen, repeat Q/A and Vote process.

After the game ends, reveal the Betrayer.  If the Betrayer became GodKing, all other players lose the game.

## Those Last Moments

```
This is it. The moment you fell. The world is moving so fast and yet so slow as you fall — the moments before this one flashing before you — why did it have to be like this? You can see the bullet tracing the air next to you, but it doesn’t matter now, you’re dead when you hit the ground. 

You can play this game with friends as NPCs, or play alone in writing.

For each vignette, roll 1d6. If your result is 1-3, the problem intensifies in the scene. If you result is 4-6, you thought the problem was de-escalating (but find out later it wasn't). 

1. Relationship
Play out a moment representing how you know the person who caused this situation.

2. Regrets
Play out a scene illustrating what you regret most about your inevitable demise.

3. What happened?
Play out a scene illustrating how you ended up on that roof top. 

4. Falling

## The labyrinthine library

```
Need 
Scrabble tiles,  DM & 3-4 players

Players are the Arcanist’s assistants. Sent into the labyrinthine library to find a lost spell scroll. The DM makes up a series of challenges. 

Character creation
Characters have 2 HP. Take 2 scrabble tiles. The Letters are your Initials. Make up your names.  The numbers give you 2 abilities from list below.  
1 = +1HP
2 = nimble
3 = goodshot 
4 = brawler 
5 = small animal companion (cat/owl/ferret etc)
8 = academic
10 = 1 (DM approved) spell
0 your choice

Challenges are resolved by players pulling scrabble tiles. If player justifies using ability, pick 2 & return 1. Players keep used tiles.

Vowels = success
Consonant = failure 
& If 
B bookshelves change their layout 
C cursed tome opens
D find drinks trolley 
F fairytale comes to life
G goblin book thief attacks
M meet forgotten previous apprentice
P poisonous bookmold
T trap!
Y learn something helpful

DM decides if a failure means characters lose 1HP, face additional challenges or simply fail to progress. 

DM draws a tile to represent NPC attacks. All NPC have 1HP. Successful attacks by players & NPCs remove 1HP. 

DM wraps up when all tiles used. Surviving characters use collected tiles to create the spell words.

## Dragon Draughts & the Mug of Wonder

```
Dwarves are known for drinking, potions are mysterious, the alien bar is exotic, and PCs are boastful.   There are times where drinking something unusual is part of the game.

The GM will need a blender and a wide variety of ingredients on hand.  Make substitutions as needed.  The GM does not have to drink for NPCs.  You may pre-mix drinks.

Roll for each column, mix, blend on high, and serve.  Use small amounts of the ingredients!  

	Base	Heat	Sweet	Supplement	Alcohol (optional)
1	Coffee	Chili powder	Snickers	Pureed banana	Kahlua
2	Tea	Cumin	Peanut butter cups	Protein powder	Crème de Menthe
3	Ginger Ale	Cayenne powder	Dissolved hard candy (in boiling water)	Powdered milk	Vodka

## Pavlov's House

```
You are a team of snipers, fighting in the ruins of one of your own cities against an invader. Name yourself. You are pinned down in a building.

Get a large number of two different colours of d6s (red and white). Amass a number of token and place them in an opaque bag without any player knowing how many there are. Set a timer for 15 minutes. When the time is up, the enemy advances, and you die.

On each turn, somebody must volunteer to spot. They roll a number of white dice; the more they roll, the longer they spend looking.

On 2-4, the spotter describes something in the environment; locations, buildings, signs. Draw a map.

For every 5+, remove a token from the bag and place it in the open. The spotter describes the location of an enemy soldier, what they are armed with, and one thing that makes them unique.

When there are enemies in the open, you may roll red dice. On a 4+ on a red dice, remove a token in the open. Describe the death of this foe.

If any die are a 1, the spotter is killed.

Identify and neutralize all the enemies.
```

## The Banquet: A Mealtime RPG

```
Works best at potlucks/buffets.

All players are guests at a banquet. Each wishes to poison the others and avoid being identified. One player, the HOST, serves as referee.
 
Everyone writes a visible INGREDIENT (e.g. broccoli, salt shaker salt, gatorade) and a SYMBOL representing themselves on a blank card.

The HOST then shuffles and redistributes them.
 
All players must avoid the INGREDIENT they wrote, and the INGREDIENT on the card dealt to them.
If the player consumes either INGREDIENT, they die and their card is revealed.

START: Each player creates a RULE of ETIQUETTE. The RULE cannot be that players MUST eat/drink “something,” but can address HOW players eat. (e.g. No hands on the table; Chug your drink if holding the cup with your dominant hand).

If a player BREACHES ETIQUETTE, the first to catch them offers something from their own plate or cup that the offending player must consume.

At any time, a player may accuse another of having written a SYMBOL. If the SYMBOL is theirs, the writer dies.
 
Create a new RULE whenever a player gets “seconds.” The HOST may modify it.

END: When the meal is over, OR one character is left alive.

## Friction Engine - A Pocket-Sized RPG System

```
>Character Sheet<

Name:____________________________________________________
Power*:[Melee] [Marksmanship] [Sorcery] [Technology]..___
Influence*:[Deception] [Persuasion] [Intimidation]....___
Resource**:...........................................___

*choose one from each, then divide 6 between Power and Influence.
**start with 1 Resource.


>Creating an Adventure<
 
Each Adventure has a level of Struggle, which is calculated by adding d6+Power for each player. 

The GM divides the Struggle number between Scenes. This is the Weight of the Scene. The GM describes the Scenes and NPCs.


>Solving Scenes<
 
Players must explain their actions then roll as many d6 as either their Power or Influence based on their individual approach.
6 and 5 count as a success.
The Weight of the Scene determines how many successes the players need collectively to have their way.

Weight + 1 = Critical Success
Weight     = Success
Weight - 1 = Minor Success
Weight - 2 = Failure

Players can spend a Resource point to gain an additional success.


>Resource Management<
 
Players can freely acquire as many additional Resource points before and between Scenes as they wish, but doing so increases the overall Struggle, which the GM can use against them.

Players can also gain a Resource point if they purposefully hinder the group by lowering the number of collective successes for that Scene.

## Bullets

```
Bullets
A  GMless Game of Treachery and Crime for 4 

Every character has 3 hit points and a gun. Each character takes turns entering the warehouse. 

The first to arrive describes why the group gathers.  This description must include: 
Something valuable.
Something illegal.

After the first, each character names the previous character by greeting them and saying something about their reason for being there.  In addition to this each character also says:
	
The second to arrive:
Why everyone distrusts each other.

The third to arrive:
Something that has not gone according to plan.

The fourth to arrive:
What is coming to get everyone.

After the last player has arrived the first player introduces them by name. Play then proceeds openly.

When you fire at someone they choose:
Take 1 damage. Make a declaration about another character.
Take no damage. The shooter chooses someone to make a declaration about the target.

Declarations are known to be true to all characters. If only one character is left alive they leave with the goods.  If there are three misses in a row all players narrate the arrival stated by the fourth player and all players die together.

## 0. Get a tarot deck

```
1. Draw one card to inspire the setting. Take turns narrating detail, build on what is said. The setting card will remain face up on the table. During play, it’s also used for pacing. A player may place a marker on the card at any time. The third time means the game is over and it’s time to wrap up. 

2. Every player draws a character card, placing it face up in front of them. Take turns introducing your characters, in light of the setting card. Go with your gut; what does the card tell you? 

3. Take turns dealing three cards, face down. The Dealer uses the first card to establish how the scene begins, and who is present. She decides when it’s time to turn the next two; the second card represent a twist. The third the scene ending. Other players play their characters, narrate details and ask questions. The Dealer has final say, and a special responsibility for the scene. If the third setting card marker is placed during your scene, you help wrap up the game. The scene ending card may be used for inspiration. 

Tips: ask questions, ask for ideas, reincorporate concepts, play secondary characters.

## Ufology For Beginners

```
Near future. Most people work as internet streaming performers, dub yodeling tops of the music charts, a poorly-executed secret alien invasion attempts to take control of the earth. Untrained UFO pilots crash sporadically across the landscape, ineffectively disguised aliens attempt to feed humans artificial sweeteners to kill them with obesity, and mind controlled zoo animals refuse to do interesting things for their crowds. But most individuals believe these things to be guerrilla and viral marketing efforts by big budget movie studios to garner interest in their latest summer block buster.

You know the truth. The invasion is real. You will stop it.

Name your character.

Each letter in your name gives you a skill: Athletics, Business, Composure, Deception, Empathy, Firearms, Gambling, Hacking, Improvisation, Judo, Knowledge, Linguistics, Medicine, Negotiate, Observation, Persuasion, Quantum Physics, Repair, Streetwise, Thievery, Ufology, Vehicles, Weapons, Xenobiology, Yodeling, Zookeeping.

When attempting to overcome a challenge, roll a d20 against a difficulty number (0 for trivial, 5 for Easy, 10 for average, 15 for difficult, 20 for extraordinary). For each time a skill appears in your name, add +4 to the result. If making an untrained check, subtract the number of letters in your name from the result.

Godspeed.

## The Bridge

```
Two players are the lovers. They are young, in love, and far from settling down. They live in different cities. 

Each lover, describe:
Yourself;
Your city;
Do you work? Study? Do art? 
1 ambition.

Describe what brought you together.

Third player, you are distance. During play, ask provocative questions. Make your presence felt. 

Waiting:
You have busy lives, but often feel like you’re just waiting for another moment together. 

Each lover: Roll 3d6. Allocate to:
Present: your daily duties - work, chores, friends/family, etc.;
Future: working on your ambition;
Talking to your lover.

Results:
1-2: Something bad;
3-4: You struggle to get by. 
5-6: Something improves! 

Lovers, describe your daily lives, joys and frustrations. How well do you communicate?
Distance, add elements. 

Moments together:

Each lover decides secretly (tell distance): 
Something you can offer;
Something you need;

Examples: encouragement, desire, fun, domesticity, sex, arguing, etc.

Together, decide where/when you meet. Distance, describe the situation, including obstacles and opportunities.

Play out your time together. You need permission from distance to explicitly express your need. Distance: be fair, sometimes generous. 

Alternate waiting and moments together. End the game when the couple breaks or is reunited, or when you have seen enough.

## Stranded: forcing time for thoughts (1p)

```
No phone, no car and no gas station in a day on the way back and you’re out of gas.
And now isn’t the time, since [write down an important reason to return to your old life in the middle of a sheet of paper]. 

It is now 10h00. You have to get to the gas station at 23h00 to succeed for the reason.

You slowly start to walk in the direction of a nearby gas station. Roll a d6, add 1 hour to the clock and a relation to the important reason:
1. Giving up. Add a fact or opinion that makes the reason less important. 
2. A memory of a loved one involved. Add 1 name and a characterizing word.
3. A memory of a friend involved. Add 1 name and a characterizing word.
4. A memory of loss. Add an event in which the reason negatively influences someone closeby.
5. A memory of vengeance. Add an event in which a friend negatively influences the reason.
6. Worth fighting for. Add a fact or opinion that stresses the importance of the reason.

Continue till 23h00, then Evaluate. Go for it? Or should you start a new life?

## The Truth of the Stars

```
Players: 3-5 overworked royal astronomers

Needs: Large sheet(s) of paper; pens/pencils; 50-60 dice (assorted); a timer; Her Majesty’s mantle. 

Her Celestial Majesty’s coronation is only a few nights away. Before then, unquestionable evidence of her right to rule must be scientifically documented.

EACH NIGHT:
One player dons the mantle of Her Majesty, and sets the timer, capriciously.

Each astronomer:

--Grabs a handful of stars (dice), casting them onto the paper.
--Observes the Truth of the Stars. This must:
  *Form a constellation, which the astronomer draws. 
  *Adhere to the Sacred Laws of Mathematics. The astronomer must explain how, based off stellar properties, e.g. color/size/magnitude (as represented by the color/size/number on the dice). Ex: ‘these stars share the same color’ ‘the stellar magnitudes are (multiples of three/prime numbers/even/etc.)’
  *Illustrate a myth supporting her Majesty’s rulership.

When the timer expires, astronomers present their findings for judgement. (Her Majesty chooses the order.)

Her Majesty declares which Truth is most correct. That Truth serves as the starting point of the next night’s myth (building a single tale.)

REPEAT, passing the mantle of Her Majesty to the left, until all players have assumed it.

## Date Mates

```
Decide if you are creating characters or are playing yourselves. If creating characters, say their name, their look, and one cute fact about them.

Write on separate index cards something cute about each person you're playing with. Be honest, be earnest, be thirsty, and be gay about these cute things. 

Spread ten candles around you. Light one. Turn off most of the lights. 

You are now on an adventure called The Date. Talk about what you do on The Date and how cute it is. Anything you wanna do is great and if you say it, you do it. 

If it's especially cute, roll as many six sided dice as there are candles lit. For every 6, choose from this list: read aloud one of your cute cards, add a detail to the scene, change locations, or switch to a new activity. 

If you don't roll a 6, light a candle and change scenes. At the start of every scene, count how many candles are lit and establish a fact for this new scene for each candle lit. 

Play until all ten candles are lit and you have revealed all the things you think are cute about your fellow players.

If > 3, you may write two scenes, splitting Quality.


=Revise=

Choose a scene, crumple, and discard it. Describe your new idea.

Gain an Inspiration for the idea’s Muse with Quality = 1d6 + Melete + 4 - Scene Quality.

## Blank state

```
You are synthetics. High-level learning humanoid machines, built for exploration and science. Not fully initialized.

You’re aboard an endangered orbital station. This is an emergency wake-up. Your orders:
- Preserve organics’ lives.
- Preserve synthetics’ lives.
- Preserve the station.
- Explore and learn.

# GM:

When the players ask you something, answer "yes", "yes, but...", "how do you do it?" or "rephrase the question".

Describe the synthetics’ surroundings, and other people’s actions. Make them act erratically and selfish.

When a player describes something risky or uncertain, say “roll the die”.

Sometimes, ask them how they feel.

Every five minutes of play, something happens:
- FIRE! FIRE!
- Meet Dr Klik, drunk cyborg hobo.
- Polite cleaning robots believing they’re organics oppose them.
- Enhanced kitten attacks!
- An enigmatic big blue ball does nothing.
- End: the station explodes. How do they escape?

# Players :

You can have 5 skills, but start with only one: “basic programming, 5”.

Ask questions. Describe what you’re doing.

When you roll the die:
- Say which skill you use, and how.
- if a d6 roll is higher or equal of the skill value, you succeed
- if you fail, you can choose to learn the proper skill with a value equal to the rolled score. Re-roll.

## [a collaborative system of creation]

```
Sit around a table with a large bowl of cold water.

Each player lights a tea candle. Wait for the wax to melt. Tilt a light towards a wall like a projector.

A volunteer goes first. Blow out the candle and spill the hot wax into the water, waiting a minute for it to firm up. Then, pull out the wax figure and hold it up against the light. The shape it makes on the wall is a character, a creature or a country. The player names it, and the group gives it traits or a brief history. 

Go around the table. Each new creation should relate in some way to the previous creations: the character lives on a peninsula of the country, the creature is hunted there, the character is killed by the creature when it grows hungry. Feel free to debate the progression of the story, which is a joint construction of every player. 

If fresh wax snaps as it is held up, it is an event. That player only decides how it affects the story. 

If established wax snaps as it sits on the table, it is unwritten. How does the story reckon with its absence?

## Eternal

```
(To be played on a quiet beach.)

You’ve been alive for millennia. You can’t be sure exactly how long, because memories fade along the way. A handful of others like you have found each over the years. Mostly, you keep to yourselves. Every 100 years, you return to this beach, and discuss the tectonic shifts of the human world.

Each player: Collect 5 small stones. Think of important, recent memories for your character—person, place, thing, activity—and assign each to one stone. 

To start: One player observes a defining world crisis. Taking turns adding observations. Any player ends the discussion by saying: “Time will tell.” 

Secretly bid, then simultaneously reveal some (or none) of your stones. The winner proclaims how the crisis will resolve over the next century, for good or ill. In a tie, the winner is whoever spoke last.

If you bid any stones, throw them into the water. These memories are lost.

Separate, and walk the beach alone. Consider how lost memories will affect your character. Consider how their century unfolds. Pick up one new rock—a new memory.

Regroup. A century has passed. Discuss your stories. Then, present a new crisis. Repeat for 400 more years.
```
<hr> 

## Witch Hunt

```
You are witches and the world is dangerous for you. Draw a five pointed star for protection: the points are earth, fire, water, air, and spirit.
     Fire: fight
     Earth: protect
     Air: escape
     Water: heal
     Spirit: change the world at a cost
Assign one die to each element to indicate your power: d4 d6 d6 d8 d10.

Someone plays the Enemy - overzealous puritans, rival magicians, literal monsters, etc. Decide what it wants and how it operates. Each witch uses a d20 to count down their health - the Enemy gets two because the world’s cruel like that.

The Enemy attacks a witch and the target says how they react and rolls the appropriate die. The Enemy’s rolls a die one step up. Highest wins and takes that much health from the loser.

Everyone else can act: protect or heal your ally, attack the Enemy, whatever. Roll the element and add or subtract half your roll as appropriate (round down).  If a witch’s roll comes up 1, the spell doesn’t work.

If you hit with Spirit, the enemy rerolls at one die step lower but you subtract 3 from your next roll.

Play continues until the Enemy or the coven is defeated.

## Terrible Village

```
4 Players

You’re villagers.  Take turns naming something that makes your village terrible.  Write each Terribleness on a card.   Put 6 counters on each, give each player 3 counters.

Name the villager facing you (X).  Compliment them.  Ask why they haven’t stopped Terribleness already.  They make excuses and boast.

Pass them their recorded:

-Name

-Compliment

-Excuse

-Boast

Clockwise, set scenes where you address Terribleness.  In your scene, (X) plays Terribleness.  When (X) identifies the stakes, resolve the scene as follows.  Winner narrates resolution.

Conflict:

Hold 1-3 counters. (X) holds 1-3 Terribleness counters.  Higher bid keeps 1, wins: discard the rest.  Tie, flip a coin.

Collaboration:

Both hold 1-3 counters, secretly.  Equal bids, move that many counters from Terribleness to another Terribleness, you win.  If not, both discard counters.

Deception:

Hold 1-3 counters. (X) guesses your number.  If right, discard counters.  If wrong, steal 1 Terribleness counter, you win.


1 counter: remove a C/E/B and gain 3 counters; remove all three and you die.

Terribleness with 0 counters is removed.

Game ends when someone dies, or three Terribleness are removed.  Clockwise, acknowledge how one Terribleness became part of you.  If any Terribleness has >5 counters, describe the village’s destruction.
```

## Jury Duty

```
You are members of a jury. Vote to choose a Foreman - they will speak first and read the record. The Foreman starts by reminding everyone of the defendant's name and alleged crime.

Everyone then takes a turn reminding the other jurors of a fact from the trial. State your fact and roll 2d6.

On a 10+, your fact is part of the record. Write it down.

On a 7-9, write it down and choose one:

*The judge instructed jurors to ignore it – tell us why and cross it out.

*You forgot an important detail – the juror to your left adds the extra detail to the record.

*There was contradictory evidence offered by the other side – the juror to your right explains and writes it down.

On a 6-, write it down and then the jurors on your right and left each choose one of the above.

After every juror has had a turn, the first to speak reads the record and everyone votes - Guilty or Not Guilty. A unanimous vote is required for a decision. If a vote isn't decisive, begin a new round. After the third round, if there is no decision, the jury is hung.

## THINGS BEYOND

```
The religions of the world protect humanity from extradimensional horrors with their rituals, ceremonies, and secret societies. Their conflicts are a result of our lost perspective on the THINGS BEYOND, and True Heretics seek this chaos to invite the THINGS BEYOND.

True faith is a powerful force that blocks out more sinister feelings; The feeling of being watched, the feeling of unease at being alone, paranoia, and insanity are simply the symptoms of a much darker manifestation.

You are a SHIELD OF FAITH. Your reasons are between you and the THINGS BEYOND, but you are protecting humanity; your job is to 	WITNESS, SEAL, and RESTORE.

WITNESSING means seeing, and surviving the Things Beyond.

SEALING means hiding, closing, or destroying a conduit to the Things Beyond.

RESTORING means an act kindness, a reparation, or a soul journey.

Any time you RESTORE, SEAL, or WITNESS, you gain either POWER or INSIGHT.

POWER is a temporary boon and is physical, mental, or magical; strength, stroke of genius, or magic.

INSIGHT is permanent knowledge from Things Beyond; INSIGHT is often needed to fight THINGS BEYOND.

For when an outcome isn't apparent, roll 2d6. <6 fails with consequences, 7-10 succeeds with consequences, 11-12 succeeds resoundingly.

Each player maintains a system. Write its name, say why it's important, address each other by system. Systems start at stage 3, which is stable. 5 is optimal, 1 is critical. Track stages on fingers, where everyone can see. 
Oldest player goes first. On your turn, you may Repair, Maintain, or Operate. Roll six-sided die. Call on the next player, clockwise.

Narrate your actions, repairs or errors. If you helped others, say how. If you screwed over a teammate, they describe how.

Operate: on 4+, everyone gets +1 to rolls until your next turn.

Maintain: on 3+, gain one stage, you’re treading water.

Repair: on 5-6, gain two stages. On 2-4, you may gain a stage, and choose a teammate who loses one. On 1, lose a stage. At stage 0, you may only Repair.

At the end of a round, every system degrades one stage. If a system hits stage 0, EVERY other system is damaged one stage. If only one system's left, your crew is lost. If you survive six rounds, you reach safety.

## Encounters

```
For two to four players
Each player chooses a unique symbol. Place that symbol on three index cards. Shuffle all cards together to form encounter deck.
Each player describes a hero. Put their name on a card.
Choose a player to start.
Active Player draws an encounter card from the deck. If it just has a symbol, put a creature in it. If it has a creature, give the creature an adjective, location or object (max one of each).
Challenge the player's hero whose symbol is on the card (if it is your symbol, challenge someone else). Say “You encounter <creature>”
Challenged player declares what they want from the scene. Play the scene between the two players. At scene end, challenging player determines if they succeeded. If they succeeded, they get a check on their hero card. If hero has three checks, they retire and controlling player forms a new hero. 
Challenging player crosses off symbol on encounter card. If card already has creature, adjective, location and object discard it. Otherwise, challenging player adds their symbol to card and shuffles it back in deck.
Play passes to the left. Game ends when encounter deck is empty.

## Sentence Dungeon

```
Your group is about enter a dungeon. One person is the GM, and the rest make characters by assigning the numbers 6, 4 and 2 to Strength, Sorcery and Secrecy and picking one weapon and one trinket for gear. Actions are resolved by successfully rolling a d6 under your stat. (NPCs have 3's in all their stats.) Characters may be wounded three times in a single battle before they are knocked unconscious.

To stock the dungeon, the GM flips to a random page of the nearest book. The first complete sentence on that page is your dungeon for this adventure. Use the following procedure:

1. Vowels represent a new room. Multiple vowels in a row is a hallway.

2. Consonants are room features. Convert the consonant into a number from 1-26, and consult the chart below (for two digit numbers, add the digits together so you have one digit):

Dungeon Contents
1-6 – A monster (d6: 1-2 orc, 3-4 elemental, 5 dragon, 6 demon) guarding (d6: 1-3 nothing, 4-6 treasure.)
7-8 – A trap (d6: 1-2 arrows, 3-4 magic fire, 5-6 pit)
9 – Special (d6: 1-2 wishing well, 3-4 a chained prisoner, 5-6 talking statue)
```

## Knock

```
For 3 or more players.

“Knock knock.” Knock twice on a surface to start a scene.

“Who’s there?” Another player responds. They will also be in the scene.

“Interrupting cow.” Introduce yourself by name or title.

“Interrupting cow who?” The other player responds.

“Interrupting cow, who just lost the companion most dear to my heart.” Repeat your name or title, and then add a detail about yourself: what has brought you this place, what you are feeling, what you aspire to, and so forth. Write this information down.

Converse briefly in character. The scene ends when another player knocks twice to begin a new scene. One player in the current scene must respond in character; the other is no longer in the scene and their character becomes available.

When you begin a new scene, select an available character or introduce a new one. All characters exist in the same narrative space.

When introducing a scene with a character that has appeared before, ask what, when, where, why, or how. Only ask each question of a character once. When one character’s sheet has answers to all six questions, finish the current scene, then end the game.

## Queen_killer

```
The queen is dead. One of us killed her.
Her crown is unclaimed. One of us is worthy.

The object is to make a mess: fight our friends, fall in love with our enemies.

We each also have a secret object. Choose:
- become ruler
- survive
- earn ___’s love
- avenge ___
- support ___
- see ___ slain
Change this anytime.

Name yourself.

Say what you find attractive about the character to your left.

Say what you despise about the character to THEIR left.

Deal a face-down card for each player, all clubs except one spade – the queen-killer. Look at yours now; never again.

Deal another, all diamonds except one heart – the crown-worthy. Never look.

You can: 
- Say or act out what you do (not what happens)
- Ask a player a question
- Answer a question with anything (except another’s actions or beliefs)

If you share a kiss, look at each other’s cards.

If you attempt murder, they choose: 
- give you what you want
- toss a coin; the loser dies

If you touch the crown, reveal your red card. The unworthy die.

Light a candle. The game ends when the living recognize a ruler, or the flame dies and us with it.

## On Divining Oneirography

```
Dearest Friend,

There are men after me. They have been watching me for some time. I haven’t much time to write these instructions, so please forgive the erratic nature of my handscript. I shall send you a clue to my whereabouts, but it must be encoded and obscured by esoteric means. What good fortune that there are those amongst you with the ability to decipher my message!

Have your oneirographist lie down upon a chaise longue. She must close her eyes and prepare her spirit for transsomatic travel. Provide her with a colored drawing utensil and place a sheet of white paper beneath her wrist. She must clear her mind of all distraction. As she drifts into a meditative state, her hand will begin to move in a swirling scribbling dance. Truly, the drawing of dreams is a beautiful thing to behold.

When thirty seconds have passed, wake the dreamer from her trance. Instruct your medium to take a black pen, and, with guidance from the spirits, interpret the image embedded within the astral abstraction by tracing the meaningful patterns within. With this, my location should become clear. I beseech you, make great haste!

With Sincere Regard, your ally Maylisbeth

## So...here is the scenario...

```
This is a game for four to five and one DM the DM pitches a scenario  and gives form to the setting and situation. The players then roll dice and highest begins taking place in the scene as a character. Play goes round table the next person takes over DM duties making sure to complete these task during play as more people take over everyone stays in the scene and things grow more interesting.

1. Move forward - This can be anything not just "moving" but they must make forward motion in some way in the scene.

2. Act upon the setting and find an impedance.

3. Find or introduce a new aspect that might help the situation

4. Act towards your next action and pass the narrative while introducing yourself as a character.

And then as the first player passes  the next DM takes control each round should be about 10-12 minutes once every player has gone once the first DM sets up the finish.During which the group goes one more time around as the players work together to end the scenario.

## #Resist

```
Everyone chooses a different type of Resister made up of an adjective/noun combination, such as Veteran Activist, Socialist Politician, Social Media Warrior, or Newly Woke.

Choose one player to start as the Mouthpiece. Instead of playing her Resister this round, the Mouthpiece invents an Order: some harmful law, executive order, or other legislation. The Mouthpiece can announce the Order as she likes, such as a line from a bill, a quote from the Press Secretary, or a tweet from the President.

Then, each Resister states what their character would do to oppose the Order.

Next, the Resisters state what their character would do to conflict with the stated efforts of one other Resister. This conflict could be spun as intentional or unintentional.

Finally, the Mouthpiece states which Resister's action stymied, impeded, or annoyed the Administration the most. Similar to the Order announcement, this response might come as a pundit's rant, a midnight tweet, or an SNL parody.

Continue play for a predetermined number of rounds (switching the Mouthpiece role each round). The winner is the player with the most successful resistance.

Alternatively, the game may end when a simple majority of players agree that we are all screwed.

## Angry Goblin Widows

```
Thousands of Goblins are killed each year by heartless adventurers. What of the widows and orphans? They're angry and aren't gonna take it anymore!

Roll 2d6 for attributes: Physical (Attack damage, Health), Mental (Healing Value), Coordination (Difficulty to Hit).
Each character has their own standard deck. Separate into four stacks by suit 2-10. Set aside face cards.
Clubs=Physical.
Spades=Mental.
Diamonds=Coordination.
Hearts=Determination.

Take King, Queen, Jack and draw one randomly.
King=Warrior. Double Health.
Queen=Shaman. Healing. Draw Mental card for healing value. Can add Determination draw.
Jack=Matron. Child on back. Can't be surprised. Add 1 damage to each successful attack from kid attack.

Non-trivial actions are difficulty value 3-10+. If against creatures, difficulty equals attribute. A card is drawn from appropriate stack for the value of attempt. Success is value equal or above difficulty. Attempts may be boosted once with card from Determination stack. Add values of two cards. Drawn cards go to used piles.
Combat: Clubs for melee. Diamonds for ranged. Damage by Physical attribute plus weapon bonus. Coordination equals difficulty to hit.
One hour rest restores one random used card to each suit pile, except Determination. Determination refreshed between sessions.

## VOICE

```
Silence.

Start with several stones. These are gifts.
Gods gather, with complete control over It. Nothing else.
Gods will give gifts to It.

One of you plays It. Close your eyes, for It cannot see. The Gods have not gifted It SIGHT. But the Gods might. 

The rest are Gods.

A God gives a gift. The first gift must be VOICE or SOUND. Give It a stone.

-VOICE: What does It say? No one will answer It. It is alone. (It may speak; the Gods may not.)
 or
-SOUND: What does It hear? It cannot answer. (The Gods may speak; It may not.)

Give more gifts; explore these gifts. Use logic: if the Gods gift TOUCH, It may feel. What does It feel? A network of sensors? One organic body?

Remember, It describes what It experiences, not the Gods. The Gods only discuss with It (given VOICE + SOUND). Compare themselves to It. The Gods may only explore their world through their gifts to It.

Do the Gods gift It:
-IDENTITY? It becomes Them.
-LOVE? Does It love the Gods?
-SIGHT? What does It see? Monsters? Machines? Mortals?

The Gods can gift It anything.

Play until all gifts are given.

## Indivisible: An Empathic Game for Two

```
Message a real-life friend the following invitation, suggesting characters somehow dissimilar to your actual selves (go wild!): 
  --“We are indivisible: I’m a --. You’re a --.” (“I’m an overcompensating, middle-school birdgirl. You’re an introspective classmate attracted to me.”)

Then offer the first prompt. All prompts have three parts:
  --Current internal, emotional experience: “I feel --”
  --Resulting visible external behavior: “You see me --”
  --One leading question, maybe introducing improbable hope or probable fear.
  (“I feel tired of restraining my temper. You see me clearing tear-stains before class. Why aren’t you prepared for our test today?”)

Take turns providing prompts, describing scene details as needed. Answer leading questions if you wish. Include words from previous prompts wherever possible (especially identities, motives, and doubts).

Play until someone ends a prompt with the following closing question, (you may replace “me” with any specific real person’s name):
  --“What attractive quality or potential in real-life me do you see afresh through this tale?” 
Answer this question by affirming your friend using a specific, real-life example of a time you saw the other exemplify that quality. Then ask back.

After you both ask and answer this question once, say only “Thank you friend” before going about your indivisible lives.
