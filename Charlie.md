## Normaleware

```
You’re an android infiltrating humanity, but you must obey Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics:
1.  Don’t let humans get hurt
2.  Obey humans unless it breaks the first law
3.  Defend yourself unless it breaks the other laws
Roll for your directive. You win when all androids achieve their objectives. The narrator determines success criteria.
1.  Love
2.  Respect
3.  Wealth
4.  Fame
5.  Power
6.  Trust
You have six programs in your matrix. Circle one from each category. After each scene you can change one.
1.  Empathize, Seduce, Coerce
2.  Build, Repair, Design
3.  Steal, Cheat, Bargain
4.  Perform, Gossip, Boast
5.  Pander, Blame, Promise
6.  Lie, Mitigate, Confide
For risky actions, roll twice on your program matrix. If either result supports your intent, you succeed. If neither does, but you accept the consequences, you earn data. You can also just fail. Roll thrice with advantage, once with disadvantage.
Data is used for rerolls. You can also reroll by giving the narrator bugs, used to make you reroll something. You start with 3 data and can store up to 10. You can give data to other androids.
If anyone discovers what you are, lose all data and reroll objective.

## Dance

```
Roll 1d6, mark that as your EXPRESSION.
Mark BLOCKED 0.

You start as a child, you go through: childhood, school, another school, early adulthood/college, later in life.

Now:
Find somewhere, where absolutely no one will see you. Find the music track that gives you strength and energy, and makes you want move and play it.
Start dancing. Forget what you know about dancing, just do what you feel. Random moves, silly moves, wild moves, whatever you body tells you.
Follow your body.

Now roll 1d6+BLOCKED. If you rolled higher or equal than your expression, something happened, select:
- your parent saw you dancing and told about it to someone else, they shared a laugh, it hurt
- someone told you, you can't dance
- you saw people dancing on TV and you heard that this is how people should dance
- someone walked in on you, and laughed
- something else - think of something, imagine it

You get +1 BLOCKED each time one of those happen.

Dance and roll for each phase you go through (at least 4 times)

If and when your BLOCKED is equal or higher to your EXPRESSION, you can't dance anymore. I am sorry.

## Anonymous Correspondence

```
A player writes down the following themes onto scrap pieces of paper:

Romance
Drama
Action
Horror
Comedy
Science Fiction
Thriller
Fantasy

These genres are placed into a hat. Each player draws one theme at random.

The player to have last written and posted a letter begins the game.

The first player begins by pretending to dictate some form of correspondence they have written to the player on their right. The first player creates a fictional character for the second player to role play as, a fictitious scenario and it must be written to match their theme drawn from the hat all within their dictated correspondence. The first player will sign the correspondence as "From Anonymous."

The second player does the same as the first but signs the letter off as the fictional character dictated by the player before them.

The last player will eventually assign a role to the first player.

Once players have been assigned their roles they must stay as that character for the remainder of the game.

This continues around the circle until the players have reached a satisfactory conclusion.

## Pasteur: The action RPG

```
Pasteur
Action RPG

You take the role of a 19th century Napoleon style imperial guard shrunk to the size of a blood cell injected inside a living organism to fight against bacteria, virus, germs, and other diseases. The host’s blood vessels provide an endless maze of tunnels where an epic battle will lead your regiment to glory. 

      Imperial Guard, HP: 10
      Stats:  Attack: 1   Defense: 2   Strategy: 1

Players take turn in sitting order, performing one of these actions:
      Gunshot: 1D6 + Attack – target’s Defense = damage
      Bayonets: 2D6 + Attack – target’s Defense = damage
                            Can’t be used on flying monsters
      Assist: Add Strategy stat value to target ally’s next roll
      Camp: Heal up to Strategy stat value

Then the Disease Master plays all monsters’ turn in any order. This goes on until one side is defeated. If victorious, all players choose one stats they increase by 1 and get 5 HP.

Monsters example:
    Flu, HP: 8   Defense: 4
	Trample: 1D6 – target’s Defense = damage

    Rabies, HP: 10   Defense: 2   Flying
         Bite: 2D6 – target’s Defense = damage

    Pox, HP: 14   Defense: 3 
         Infect: 1D6 – target’s Defense = damage
           or
         Multiply: Pox lose half HP and creates a new Pox

## Human-Zombie Fulfillment Symposium

```
This game is inspired by the song, “Re: Your Brains”. In it, humans have locked themselves inside a mall to escape zombies. The game centers on negotiations between the humans, who would prefer to keep their brains, and the zombies, who would prefer to eat those brains.  

To begin, players are evenly divided into zombies and humans. If there are an odd number of players, the extra player is a zombie. 

Players write the name of their character on an index card. If they are human, they write one skill or piece of equipment (e.g. scientist, flamethrower) that they have. If they are a zombie, they write one type of person or item (e.g. spouse, junk food) in their possession.

Each human player also writes down one demand that is specific to their character, such as seeing a loved one or consuming a rare food. If they are a zombie, they write the demand as “Your brains.” 

Characters meet and negotiate for 20 minutes, during which time no violence is allowed. When time is up, they either make the necessary exchanges, or return to their own sides of the barricades.

## Coin-cidence

```
The dragon's eye explodes as your hewn stone connects from 100 yards. On the ride back to town your horse gets spooked; you break your neck.  

THE GIST:
Players collaboratively tell a story.

Player 1, is a gamemaster.  Player 1 moderates the game by describing all the non-player elements such as plot and setting.

Players 2-N each invent characters that Player 1 weaves into the story.  Each player controls their character's actions in that story...while that character lives.

SETUP:
Player 1 describes a setting
Players 2-N each describe a character

GAMEPLAY:
Player 1 tells a story which includes the setting and other Players’ characters.  Player 1 describes everything except what the other players’ characters do.  During this story, the other players interject to describe the actions of their characters.  

If Player 1 wishes, they may subject any character action to a "test".  When this happens, the game pauses and a fair coin is flipped.  

Heads: critical success.  
Tails: critical failure.  
Player 1 interprets and describes that outcome.

No character may repeat an action that has been subjected to a “test”.

The game ends when the story is complete or until Player 2-N's characters are all dead.

## Thank You For Sharing

```
Friends are powerful, friends love things; make things; help you feel better about things. This game is about enthusiastic support and why we need it. 

Find one friend. One of you is Player A, one Player B.

Play: PA starts talking about [Thing] they like. 

PB: “I like the IDEA of [Thing] but…” 

PB complains about [Thing] for two minutes. Talk about how [Thing] disappointed you. Disliking [Thing] makes you feel better about yourself. It’s boring. You couldn’t get into it. The characters are too whiny. There are attitude issues you find repugnant. PB should feel uncomfortable with how mean they're being. Stay away from real reasons to dislike a thing, like racism or the money going to a shitlord in political office. 

PB, cool off. PA, write 200 words of anything: fiction, poetry, smut, fluff...

PA reads aloud to PB.

PB spends five minutes gushing about PA’s work; it's the best thing they’ve ever heard. It’s ok to shout “YOU MADE THIS? HOLY WTF ITS SO GOOD” If you’re both huggers, hug. Shout positively about how Player A’s work is amazing and makes you feel good.

Take time to discuss how you feel. Switch roles and repeat if desired.

## RPG Gumbo

```
Get a bunch of players and snacks. Each player must bring three of the crunchiest, dustiest, or hippiest RPG books they own. Make some characters. Shuffle the books and everyone takes one book. You must use physical copies, there should be plenty left. Whenever a rule is needed, all players search their one book for a relevant rule. The first person to find a relevant rule wins narrative control. The rule must be read aloud. You do not need to follow the rule to win. After each rule resolution, shuffle the books so that nobody has the same book twice.

## Flesh, and Other Inconvenient Things

```
Survive 30 days until the military arrives.
Each new day: Roll 3d6 and arrange them lowest to highest, corresponding to morning, midday, and night. That’s the number to roll to return home safely at that time of day.

Everyone takes an action and chooses to return home or not. Turns advance time. If night, you must return home.

You determine the difficulty of your actions (N), roll >N to succeed, otherwise fail. If you roll higher, you don’t get more stuff.

Bases = 10 starting HP.
Characters = 10 max HP, 0 = death.

## Caltrops

```
Requires: 2 players, 8d4, 20-60 minutes

You are two ninja masters. Your clans have sworn to destroy each other. It’s a caltrop battle!

You each have three ninja teams under your command:
 - Sword Ninjas: Strong; +1d4 vs. Shuriken Ninjas
 - Shuriken Ninjas: Ranged; +1d4 vs. Lotus Ninjas
 - Lotus Ninjas: Poisonous; +1d4 vs. Sword Ninjas

Secretly choose a team to attack your enemy. Both masters reveal their teams at the same time and determine how many caltrops to throw:
 - Standard Team: 1d4
 - Roleplay the clan war before revealing: +1d4
 - Advantage over enemy team: +1d4

Throw your caltrops to start the battle! Whoever rolled highest is the victor, and may describe the battle. The loser may narrate the death of one of their ninjas. The sole ninja in that team now rolls 2d4 as a base, according to the law of conservation of ninjutsu. Reroll any ties.

Any team that loses twice is destroyed. Battle until one master has no more ninjas. The defeated ninja master attacks the enemy's stronghold alone! Ninja masters roll 3d4 as a base, +1d4 for roleplay. They may reroll 1d4 for each ninja team still under their command. The winner of this battle is the ultimate ninja master!

## All it takes….

```
All it takes…. 
One roll 
One decision 
One sacrifice 
Space is dangerous. Not like in the movies, far worse than that. Humans can’t survive in a vacuum, it’s rather simple really. You were on a mission, on a spacecraft when something went wrong. Now your engines are out, rescue might be coming, but you only have enough oxygen for some of you to make it. 
To play 
Roll 1d6 and take on the character from the below list. If someone else has the role, re-roll until you get a role no one else has. 
1.	Doctor 
2.	Engineer 
3.	Pilot 
4.	Captain 
5.	Navigator 
6.	Communications officer 
As a group give your spacecraft a name 
Taking turns give your character a name, an identity. Pick one other player, describe why they would protect you. Pick a different player, describe why they would choose you to be the sacrifice. 
Each player takes a turn, arguing why they should be the one to be saved. Then each player takes another turn, arguing why someone else should be sacrificed. 
At the end, vote on who to sacrifice, when there is a majority decision the game ends, did you choose right?

## Laughter or a Lit Flame: A Hack of Renga

```
Here I have a game:
Paper, pens, and three players.
It's simple to play.

First Player writes a haiku
That describes a character.

Inspire love or hate.
Make us laugh. Or nod, silent.
Good haiku delights.

Player Two writes a waki,
(Two lines, both of seven beats).

Describe there events
That befall the character.
Tragic? Exciting?

Hide the haiku from our sight.
Fold it back or cover it.

The third player's turn?
Haiku of a character,
Waki-affected.

Now hide the waki from view.
It's player one's turn again.

On each turn, you write.
First respond to what you see,
Then hide what you saw.

Alternate. Haiku. Waki.
Maintain silence as you write.

Or else, talk of things
Unrelated to the game 
TV shows, your day.

Haikus invent the people:
Lives impacted by events.

Wakis are events
That change everything for
Our small poem-folk. 

When you’ve written five times each,
Reveal all and read aloud.

Whoever read then
Sits in silence. And so
Must the other two.

The silence can be broken
By laughter- or a lit flame.

## Tales from the Lost Kitchen

```
Go to a kitchen.

You are a group of people who live in the future. 
You have uncovered this kitchen. It belonged to your ancestors.
It is full of many things. You do not know what they are. 

How to play:

Take an item. Tell us what it is. 
Then, tell a tale of your ancestors. How did they use it? Why? 

Now it’s the next person’s turn. They have a choice.
They may either agree with the tale that has been told and the values it represents. If they do this, they take a new item, and tell another, consistent tale.
Or they may disagree. Then, they must take the same item and tell a new tale that reveals the truth.

Repeat this until you become weary of your forbearers. 

Then, come together and use the evidence you’ve established through your stories to describe your ancestors and confirm your collective history. The truth of your past is now revealed.

Leave the kitchen invigorated by your enlightenment.

Variant: Your ancestors had to flee this kitchen and leave. If they hadn’t, you wouldn’t be here today. This is what they left behind.

## Intergalactic Bake-Off!

```
You've been invited to the prestigious Intergalactic Bake-Off! Now is the time to showcase your unique baking abilities!

Each player starts with five tokens (coins). Next, each player creates six ingredients. These can be anything: the heart of a dying star, carefully crumbled plastic, grass-flavored chocolate, etc... Then determine the first player, who picks one ingredient from the list they didn't create. Continue going around until each ingredient has been chosen.

Fill out a recipe card as follows with an ingredient in each blank:

(1) Two cups __________
(2) One cup __________
(3) One tbsp __________
(4) Two tsp __________
(5) Dash of melted __________
(6) Sprinkle of ground ___________

Roll one six-sided die (1d6) to determine which ingredient horribly backfires. Give your recipe a name, then narrate how you make it at the contest, including the problem ingredient. Other players may give a token to the current narrator to sabotage their baking. The saboteur describes their treachery. The narrator rolls 1d6. On 1-3 the sabotage occurs and the saboteur takes back their token. On 4-6 the sabotage helps and the narrator describes how everything works out! The player with the most tokens at the end of the bake-off wins!

## The People You Meet On The Graveyard Shift

```
You work a dead-end job - shelf-stocker, burger-flipper, roadie. You're miserable, but you still hold on to something.

Tell everyone your job, tell them why you hate it, and tell them why you continue. Your name is optional.

You have three Traits - Hungry, Tired, and Poor. Each starts as a d8. Write down three things that are OK about life - these are your Holds.

Whenever one of your Traits come up, roll it. If you rolled a 3-, reduce that Trait's die by one step. If you rolled a 6+, tell everyone how that Trait screws you over, and increase that trait's die by one step - if it's a d12, treat the roll as a 9+ instead.

If you rolled a 9+, cross out a Hold. If all of your Holds are crossed out, you leave the game - commit suicide, go postal, whatever.

If a Trait would be reduced below a d4, remove it from your character. Whenever someone reaches out to you, you can replace a crossed-out Hold - this can be good or bad.

---

One player is the Boss - they describe the world, and should be cruel to the other players. They don’t have Traits or Holds, and never roll.

## Space Debris - A Chore-Playing Game for Two

```
After a disaster on your Orbiter….
You play the Walker. Spin fast for 20 seconds. Pick up a bag of garbage to take out to the curb; you are carrying a part of the payload needed to repair your Escape Pod. When you walk on the driveway, close your eyes; you are falling into space. You must only walk slowly, holding your breath unless you can grab something permanent. ( house, tree, car, etc ). Another player is the Watcher, who watches from a window inside the home, giving directions to the Walker via cell phones. You can only talk to the Watcher when holding on to something.

During the walk, when the Watcher sees:
Pets or children...discuss your loved ones on Earth.
Adults...discuss your dead comrades.
Car driving by….ASTEROID SHOWER, you spin wildly until dizzy.

If you take a breath without holding on to something, you become disabled and cannot move or talk. The Watcher must now enter space, walking slowly, holding their breath and eyes closed. If the Watcher touches you, you are revived, and the Watcher returns to the window. If the Watcher takes a breath beforehand, you both die in space.

## Bloodfeud – Diplomacy with Vampire

```
You're bloodsucking leeches with grand aspirations but there's never enough to go around.

Everyone divide 15 points between Blood and Clout. Define two traits: major/minor (worth +2/+1 respectively, each takes a night to refresh after use).

There's a communal pool, The Hunt, which starts empty. Vampire hunters are nasty business.

Each night connive and socialise with the others, trading resources freely, then take one action (revealed and resolved simultaneously); adding trait bonuses fitting the narrative and choosing applicable targets. You may aid others with your traits.

Feed: Gain 1 Blood. If half or more Feed, each adds 1 to The Hunt.
Conflict: Roll*. Target may change actions to oppose. Multiple parties can participate. Highest success steals 2 points, victor's choice. Add 1 to The Hunt.
Undermine: Roll*. Success steals 1 Clout.
Reign: Roll*. Success negates all actions against you.

Unless you Feed, lose 1 Blood.

Repeat each night until one remains.

If Blood reaches 0 you wither and die. If The Hunt hits 10, everyone gets staked.

*Roll: 1d10 equal-or-under Clout+Bonuses to succeed. If you roll equal-or-under The Hunt you've been confronted by hunters, spend Clout point-for-point to reduce The Hunt below your roll to avoid death.

## Adfectomancer

```
You've come a long way to obtain your power. But now you're alone.
Perhaps you can use your magic to bring back an old friend?
You are the Adfectomancer, and there's nothing the human mind can possibly hide from you.

Focus on the person you desire to summon, and visualize an event you remember with fondess about the two of you. You’re going to shape the past.
Think of 3 different ways it could have ended differently, and complete each sequence in your mind until you reach a satisfactory check point.

During your divination stay focused and check:
• You gain a +Mantra for every positive change.
• You gain a –Mantra for every negative consequence.
• A -Mantra cancels a +Mantra. Add up.

At the end of every divination, you can complete one ritual.
Roll a d6 +1d6 for every +Mantra:
• If you score at least one 6, you gain 1 Karma.
Repeat until you have 3 Karma.

Now pick up your preferred method of communication, be it a phone or something else. Indulge no more and complete the spell without fear.

## Gambling on the River Styx

```
To cross the river Styx, you owe Charon two pennies.  Penniless ghosts play mahjong on the riverbank to win passage.


Place a skeleton nearby. That’s Charon, waiting for you. 

Place six matching pairs of coins into a bag.  Pass the bag around. When you get the bag, draw one coin and explain why you fear the afterlife.  If your coin matches a coin you already have, instead return it and don’t explain. Repeat until the bag empties.

Place the mahjong tiles in the bag.  Each player draws five tiles.  

Each round, everyone antes a coin into the pot. Draw one tile.  Play one tile. Reveal simultaneously.

The highest numbered tile wins the pot. The winner recalls a memory of their life, based on suit:
-Dots: selfishness
-Bamboo: cruelty
-Characters: tragic mistakes

Ties: Split the pot evenly (randomly), leaving the remainder in the pot.  Include the other tied players in your memory.

If you play a un-numbered tile, you lose the round. Tell a story about redemption.

If you ever match a pair of coins, you must approach Charon and cross to your afterlife. None know what comes after.

If you have no coins, you shiver on the riverbank for eternity.

## Ashes of the Sun

```
You were once companions Commander Sun, captain of the Dunkirk-SR3 and hero of the Xanar War. She sacrificed herself to repel the alien machines and banish them from our galaxy. Each of you played your part and helped her save humanity. Ten years later, each of you hear a rumour that Sun has been found on some distant outpost, deep in Xanar space. Now you come together for one last mission.
*Introduce your Companions*
1) Name your companion
2) Tell us what you used to be. 
3) Tell us how most people now see you? 
4) Tell us what do you hope to become? 
5) Tell us the nicknames two other companions earned.
*The Rules*
One of the companions was Sun’s lover. They describe the first scene, and ask one question of another companion. After answering, that person asks someone else another question. Each scene ends when a companion cannot answer a question.  
*The Mission*
Describe your voyage to reclaim the Dunkirk SR3 from the shipbreakers, searching for information on the pirate outpost of Scourge Station and navigating through the Ysarl blockade. Once you reach the Sun, describe how she has changed. Together, decide if you will bring her home.   
```

## Hopeless

```
You’ve been kidnapped. Introduce yourselves. 

Objective: Find the key and Escape.

The GM draws the map of the captors’ house, positions the captors and key.The house doesn’t change, but the captors’ and key positions will change every day.

Decide via D20.

Take turns to explore, only one person per night. 
Hear noises by asking your GM.

When you’re alone, you have the chance to become insane without emotional support from the group.
You have 5 minutes to explore before you die of insanity
While exploring, only you can grab a piece of paper and layout the map as you discover it.

If you end up in the same room with a captor, turn on a metronome, sync breath with the beat, if you fail, you get discovered. Go from 60BPS to 110BPS gradually.
You get nervous, your sanity won’t last long.
Light a match. It represents your mental sanity for that moment. 
The GM throws a dice. Get a number >= while syncing breath before the match runs out or you’ll be spotted. 
If you succeed, go back your normal timer.
If you die, explain the cause and express an emotion you felt before death in one word.

## Dungeon Black

```
Dungeon Black is a two player roleplaying game about a group's inexorable descent into darkness, madness, and death. 

The Shadow is the game master, the darkness that will encroach upon the flame.

The Player acts as the Delvers, a group of four ill-fated characters. They could be a band of survivors during an apocalypse, a group of highschoolers hounded by a slasher, or a company of would-be adventurers, descending into an ancient ruin. 

Each Delver is defined by a single noun, describing the type of situation the character is good at overcoming.

The Player must divide 7 six-sided dice among the Delvers. A Player rolls all of a Delver’s dice to overcome a difficult a task; they succeed unless a 1 is rolled. If a 1 is rolled, that die is removed from the game. A Delver with no dice is dead, mad, or otherwise lost.

The Player also has a tea-candle and a pile of five matches. A match may be spent by lighting it in the candle; this allows the Player to re-roll a single Delver’s roll.

The Shadow may allow the Delvers to find items or characters that grant more matches or dice.

## Prime Directive: a game of not screwing up

```
Players expand on parts from the script in sequence. Roll a die to pick terms from lists. 

XO:

Captain: Well done people. 

Players discuss proposals for first contact and trade. Eventually the Captain choses one proposal and each crewperson rolls a die; secretly adding or subtracting one. If the total is less than four times the number of players the mission is a failure. The player with the best explanation for the failure is the next Captain.   
* roll twice on subsequent lists

## A last drink

```
Sit down across from your friend with a few mutually appreciated beverages between you.  You each have a pint glass and a shot glass.

Greet your friend and explain why it's been too long since you last spoke. As you reminisce about your last encounter, pour the liquid into your old confidant's pint glass.  Both pint glasses filled, come to understand why it's been so long since you last spoke, then nod.  When you've come to an understanding, remove all but one bottle from the table.

You must speak before each sip.  Tell your partner a story of their life.  Clarify a story you've been told about your own.  Grieve for a  lost accomplice.  Imagine where you thought you'd be.

When your partner's drink is drunk, pour them a final shot.

You don't need to tell one another that your chat together might be your last.  You both know.  That shot will be your final drink together.

You may not speak after your pint glass is empty, except to ask your partner to pour you another round.

If you are asked to pour another round, refuse.

When you wish to end the night, nod.  

When you are both ready, hug.

## RPG - Random Parable Generator

```
A Storytelling Game for Three Players

One player takes the role of Narrator.

Another takes the role of the Protagonist.

The final player is the Mediator.

The Narrator chooses the kind of story they want to tell (a grand adventure, a simple day at work, etc.), the Protagonist creates who they will be (a Princess, a Pirate, or even just themselves), and the Mediator creates a setting for things to take place in. This can be done separately (and secretly), collectively as a group, or sequentially.

The Narrator may then begin to tell the story. The Protagonist may be called on to act, or they may choose to do so on their own. If at any time the Protagonist decides to disobey the Narrator’s directions or attempt to change the story, the Mediator chooses a number between 1 and 20 and all three roll a d20. The closest roll determines who gets to decide the outcome of the event, and the Mediator is free to choose neither side’s idea, instead inserting their own.

Play continues until the story is completed to everyone’s satisfaction and/or when the Protagonist is well and truly dead.

## Relentless

```
Gather 10d6, a sheet of paper, and 4 friends.

Characters are Slaves with Hope: a shared goal that they WILL achieve to end the game. Write the Hope large so that it is always visible to all players. 

Slaves begin trapped in cages. When Players describe an action, the Facilitator may call for that Slave to roll. 

Slaves cannot own anything, even dice. They use a communal Pile of d6s equal to the Scene (beginning at 1). If the Slave fails to roll a 6, the roll fails, and 1d6 is added to the Pile, up to a maximum of 10d6. If the Slave succeeds, the Facilitator sets the next scene, and (regardless of any previous failures) the Pile resets to the number of the new scene (2d6 for 2nd scene, etc).

In 10th Scene (10d6), conflicts represent the Slave attaining their final step toward Hope. Once only one Slave remains to take part in conflicts, the stakes are Hope itself. Failure will introduce a twist and a new opportunity to reach for Hope. 

Once Hope is attained, allow each player an epilogue, describing their Slave’s future. This serves to both decompress and reward them for their endurance.

## A House Is Not a Home

```
You and a companion play family members having a horrible fight about a third relative. You’ll pace and direct the fight through building a house of cards.  Lean pairs of cards against each other to make triangles, and place cards across pairs of triangles to build bridges.

Angriest starts the argument, and builds the first triangle. Then alternate, building a new triangle or a bridge.  Build new triangles next to old ones so a bridge can be laid across them, or on a bridge to start a new layer.

As you build a triangle: insist, blame, harden.  If this also starts a new layer: insult, threaten, escalate.

As you build a bridge: empathize, reconsider, soften. 

The argument ends when one player gives in, both agree to stop fighting, or the house collapses.  

Then begin an epilogue conversation, sometime later, at a family gathering in honor of your relative.

If the house did not collapse, your relationship endured.

If the house collapsed, but only partially, it’s the first time you’ve really spoken since the fight.

If the house collapsed completely, whoever placed the last card died sometime before the gathering, before you could make peace.  Nevertheless, hold the conversation.

## The Marketers

```
You are marketers, trying to sell products presented by your President of Marketing, and add them to your portfolio. The game is played with 3-6 marketers. The first marketer to add 5 projects to their portfolio wins the game.

Each round, one marketer will serve as President of Marketing. The President has 10 six-sided funding die at the start of each round. The President will make up a ridiculous product, and the marketers must come up with a strategy to sell it. The marketers are encouraged to ask questions about the product, such as who makes it, what does it taste like, etc.

Each time a marketer pitches a good, funny, or ridiculous idea for the product’s marketing, the president can reward them a funding die. Other marketeers build off this pitch, adding to the overall marketing strategy.

When all the funding has been passed out, each marketer rolls their funding dice, to see how much profit their ideas contributed. The player that rolls the highest gets to add the project to their portfolio; ties go to the marketer with the most funding die.

If no-one has won, the marketer to the President’s right becomes the next President.

## A.C.E: A Deadly Game of Espionage

```
You are an agent of ACE (Assassination, Counterintelligence, & Espionage) on a mission that could define the fate of the world. You have been chasing your target for too long, and you are in too deep, but it all ends tonight.

Choose a role: the Agent or the Mastermind. The Agent describes the mission (what are they stopping the Mastermind from doing), and the Mastermind describes the method (how they will accomplish their plan). When the scene is set, shuffle a deck of cards, deal 5 cards to each player and set the deck face down in the center of the table. 

Flip the top card of the deck face up: if the card is red, high card wins, if black, low card wins. Matching color wins ties. 

Each player selects a card in their hand, or may ‘improvise’ and take the top card of the deck (remaining face down).

When ready, players reveal their cards. The winner of the round describes how they have succeeded in outwitting their opponent (an improvised move should be reflected in the scene), and a new round begins. 

When a player has won 3 rounds, play a final scene describing their victory.

## Rule of 3 Digits

```
Write your character concept.
Roll 3d10 to generate the 3 digits for your character.
Think of a name, write it, and you are ready to go!

The game begins with your 3 digits being unlocked
The GM describes the environment.
You describe what you are doing.
The GM will give you a binary choice and you make a decision.
Some decisions will require a check.
If a check is required, choose one of your unlocked digits. A digit value of 0 counts as a 10. 
If all digits are locked then the result is 1.
If your character concept would help then add +2 to the result.
Digits can be added together as long as the final total doesn’t exceed 10.
Reveal your result and the GM will describe the outcome.
Digits just used become locked and unusable for the next check, and any previously locked digits are unlocked.
When making a check, a value of 1 to 5 is a failure and a 6 to 10 is a success.
It takes two failures to lead to death.
Outcomes can include rewards.
Rewards are worth a +3 to checks if applicable to the situation.
```

## Duel of Change

```
2 players and a judge(s)

You need: 10 coins of same denomination and different years of minting

You are two SUPER POWERFUL SHAPESHIFTING WIZARDS. You hate each other.

Flip a coin to determine who goes first. Divide the ten coins evenly between the wizards. They then pocket the coins.

The starting player will draw a coin from their pocket. The final 2 digits in the year of minting determines which shape you shift into- pick from the list below with the two digits you have

1 Insect
2 Mouse
3 Sparrow
4 Ferret
5 Cat
6 Wolf
7 Eagle
8 Stallion
9 Bull
0 Elephant

Narrate which shape you shift into, and how you’ll defeat the opponent. Wizard 2 then does the same with a coin from their pocket, narrating how they defeat player one’s shape with their new shape.

Judge(s) then pick a winner based on narration. Discard coins, then Player 2 begins round 2 by drawing a new coin from their pocket and shapeshifting. Alternate who goes first each round. 

When no coins remain, winner of the most rounds wins and shapeshifts into a Dragon.

For added fun, do it in verse with a rap beat.

## The King and its Mute Jesters

```
The Mute Jesters are to deliver news to the King in place of the Court Advisor, fearing that the news would bring about the wrath of the King. The Jesters are there to deliver the news in a light-hearted fashion to avoid King’s wrath.

***
The Game
1 person as the Court Advisor who will write a set of words on paper(s), reveal each word only to the Jester during play.
Minimum 2 Mute Jesters who will translate the words written by Court Advisor to the King with hand/body gestures.
1 person as the King who will attempt to guess the answer gestured by the Mute Jesters.

The Jesters that managed to get the most answers from the King under 1 minute wins the round.

If you’re up for it, Jesters can combine string of words to form a sentence cooperatively together.

Rules/Notes
Each Jester has 1 minute to get the King to answer as much as possible.
The King can be a different person for each Jester.
Write at least 10 set of words/short sentences per Jester.
Players are allowed to suggest a theme before starting for the set of words to be written and played.
```
<hr> 

## In the Cards

```
Needed: 1 Deck of Playing Cards (no Jokers)

At the same time all players will contribute to the setting and scene of the Story with a single word.
One player in the group chooses the story's location (Ancient Greece, Space Station, etc)
One player chooses an object of interest (Vase, Computer Core, etc)
One player chooses the action (Steal, Discover, Protect, etc)
One player chooses the hurdle (Cursed, No Time, Enemy, etc)

Each player then defines their character with a single word description (Mystic, Engineer, Diplomat, etc) and a single word motive (Boredom, Honour, Greed, etc)

As players work together to unfold the story important or pivotal actions are resolved by going to the Deck of Cards. The protagonist draws a card from the deck and so does another player. The resulting two cards determine success or failure.

Two Black Cards = Failure
Two Red Cards = Success
One Red/Black = Mixed Results 

If during the draw a Face Card appears something wildly unexpected happens! If it is positive the protagonist describes what that is. If it is negative the group decides. On a mixed result the colour of the face card determines the nature of the twist.

## The Heist

```
Materials:  shade tokens, evidence tokens.

One player is GM, the rest are Criminals planning a big heist.

Phase one:

*  Each Criminal declares a specialty; collects 3 shade tokens.

*  Criminals draw a map together, each notes one obstacle they will overcome with their specialty.

*  GM secretly writes one complication per Criminal.

## Coloring Outside the Lines of Reality

```
You are all-powerful, multi-dimensional children, playing pretend with your favorite reality.

There is no GM and players control a fantasized version of themselves. Each player starts with 3 “nuh-uh!” tokens. 

Agree on a genre or situation. Decide randomly who takes the first “turn.” The turn-taker has narrative control. They frame a scene and define each player as a specific character in it. The turn-taker MUST start the scene by saying “pretend [X happens].” At any time, the turn-taker can end their turn and the player to their left goes next.

When a player narrates an event, no other player can deny it happened without a “nuh-uh” token. You can change or escalate the conflict. The sky’s the limit! Go over the top. Mix genres. Channel your inner eight-year-old.

A player can deny a narration by spending a “nuh-uh!” token. You MUST say “nuh-uh! That’s not what happens!” Then narrate what ACTUALLY happens. Now it’s your turn.

After all “nuh-uh!” tokens have been spent, each player gets to narrate one more action to wrap up the story. Discuss and vote who was COOLEST during the story. That player wins!

## Open Mic Dungeon Night

```
Poet mages are here gathered
To tell of dungeons mastered

One at a time on stage
Who’s the best rhyming sage?

On many slips of paper
We will compose our caper

Thirty single word challenges
Could be blocking the passages

Put them in a box
How unorthodox

Five single word spells
Wizard’s materials

Take a challenge from the box
This will be the next hard knocks

With four lines of rhyming verse
Describe how affairs aren’t worse

Rhyme the spell you must
To power the thrust

The challenge is best rhymed
So the blow will be well timed.

Avoid repeating any rhyme
Each only works the one time

Five verses end the story
Are we laudatory?

## McMurdo Station Interns

```
You’re interns at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. This wasn’t your first choice. Why?

Each player: Who are you? What’s your name? Who’s your boss? What are your roles here? 

Of the thousand people who manage to live here, describe the one who’s most important to you: your business partner, mentor, rival, lover, friend, romantic interest, research fellow, enemy, family, bully? Map these relationships; evolve as needed.

You have brought some alcohol, twelve drinks only. Describe and justify your choice.

Bad Things will happen to someone, the station, or the community itself. Start with ten index cards total. Take turns writing one option on each. Agree on tone. Inspire each other. Put these cards in a hat.

Each month: Everyone declares their monthly goal. Pull three cards. Play out 2-4 scenes​, inspired by the cards. Keep scenes focused. Who has a stake in the outcome? What’s the worst that could happen? How can you endure?

If you don’t like an outcome, take a drink. Feel free to offer others a drink. Each month, whoever drank the most creates two new cards for the hat. Tied interns collaborate.

Six months later, your internship ends. Narrate your epilogue. Can you leave? Do you? How?
```
<hr> 

## Meddling Kids

```
Assemble in the clubhouse. We’ve got a mystery!
 
The Game Master runs the mystery, describing scenes, playing antagonists, and giving clues. Create the case by rolling d6 each for Client, Assignment, Stage, and Evildoer:
 
Client: authority, classmate, neighbor, parent, pet, traveler
Assignment: haunting, missing item, missing person, murder, treasure map, vandalism
Stage: carnival, church, library, mall, school, station
Evildoer: bully, chance, cultists, pet, professional, victim
 
Players are kid detectives. Make one by assigning 0, 1, 2, and 3 to skills: Conversation, Larceny, Understanding, and Exertion. Adults get d6 more points!

Say it, do it. If in doubt, roll d6. If equal or under 2 + your skill - difficulty, you get # successes equal to the number on the die. If targeting someone, difficulty is their skill.
 
Conversation: Successes = clues someone may tell you or hours they will believe or help you.
Larceny: Open a lock, filch an item, or successes = minutes you go unnoticed.
Understanding: Successes = minutes target is distracted or clues you may learn from a scene.
Exertion: Lift something, run away, or successes = damage (4 damage and they’re out! 10 for adults) or minutes you pin someone.
 
Acting simultaneously? D6 for who’s first. Otherwise, flow with the conversation.

## Cosmic Trickster

```
Throwing yourselves to the ground, your spaceship explodes. What a pain! It’ll be ages before a ship comes looking for you. Oh well, there’s gotta be something to do around this “Earth” place while you wait.

--------------------

Nominate one person to be the Game Master. The rest are aliens from the planet Rymulus - a world where anything that rhymes is true. As a group, decide on a goal for the aliens - e.g. assassinating the president or creating a successful mountain bike hire company.

Aliens are pretty incompetent - they can’t do anything of any difficulty. However, they do have the power to transform things. To do this:
  - The alien announces that they want to transform something in the scene.
  - The GM writes down a short description of whatever it is the alien wants to transform - e.g. “rolled-up newspaper” or “Vince, the accountant”.
  - If the alien comes up with a rhyme for that description with the same number of syllables, the thing is transformed into the rhyming phrase - e.g. an alien might transform a “rolled-up newspaper” into a “full-size skyscraper”. 
  - The GM narrates the consequences of this. 

The game ends when the aliens achieve their goal or give up.

## The Stars Are Angry

```
We are the stars and we are angry.
The people of earth once revered us.
Now they worship their own lights.
They do not need us.
For this, they will pay.

Players: 1-4
Materials: D6, Map of the World

Each player goes three times.
On your turn: Make the people of earth pay by making a star fall. 

Toss a die to try making it land on the map:

If it lands off the map, roll again.  If intentionally missed describe: the people are stubborn. The people entrench their worship of their artificial lights.

If it lands in water: describe how the people of earth once loved and worshiped the stars.

If it lands on ground: draw a circle around the die on the map. Check the result and describe:
1-3:  The artificial lights do not return. The people are destroyed and have paid.  
4-5:  The artificial lights return slowly. The people haven’t learned their lesson.
6:     The artificial lights destroy the star. The people haven’t learned their lesson.
 
At the end of the game, the people of earth send us a star of their own. What do they say to us?

## The Hero Heads Home

```
You’ve saved us… but at what cost?

One of you is a Hero, the last surviving member of their Fellowship. You’ve seen your friends lose their way on the path to victory, or suffer their ultimate demise. Your task is to return to safety, to home.

Everyone else, pick one from the list. No doubling up.
The friend, loyal to a fault. What made you falter?
The betrayer, loyal to another. Who?
The knight, the honorable. What drew you away?
The innocent, the unspoiled. What broke you?
The mentor, the guide. What killed you?

The game begins on the Precipice of Darkness, where the Hero has slain the ultimate evil. Starting from the top of the list, go around the table twice. 

In the first round, only that player and everyone above them on the list plays. The Hero frames the scene, detailing their return to its location and any key differences. Play out the scene until the character’s question is answered.

On the second round, everyone plays. The player introduces their character and frames the scene they first meet the Hero in. Everyone else describes how their characters act. The Hero can only try to remember.

## Boom Boom Car Bots

```
This game is meant to be played while in the car. Make sure the driver is okay with this game being played. This game can be played with 2-4 players. You will need up to 10 six-sided dice for each player or a dice rolling app on your phone and other cars on the road. One person will say, “Ready, Set, Go.” Everyone has 10 seconds to find a car that will be their Car Bot. When you find the one you like you have to call it out to claim it. No two people can use the same car. Once everyone has their cars you roll dice equal to the first number on the license plate, 0 will count as 10 dice. You add up the total and whoever has the highest amount yells “BOOM BOOM CAR BOTS!” and wins that Car Bot battle! Replay as many times as you wish the winner keeps the Car Bot that they chose from the previous battle. Whoever wins the most amount of times is the ultimate winner.

Make sure to obey all traffic laws and do not distract your driver. The driver CANNOT play because of how unsafe it is.

<hr> 

## Götterdämmerung

```
You are great heroes, or even gods. Tonight you die.

Describe yourself and your greatest feat. Players on your left and right each name a power you have based on it. Name the third one.

Every player writes a prophecy of death. Be poetic. Draw one randomly. Accept it, reject it, rage against it, it is your doom.

Every player takes a token, called an omen.

Whatever you attempt, you succeed. To resolve a scene:
1. For each of your powers used, take a d6. 
2. Each player starting with you can describe a different way in which the situation is like your doom and hand you one of their omens. If you agree, discard it and take a d20. Otherwise, keep it. 
3. Roll your dice. If any show ‘1’, or you take another omen, there are no nasty complications. Add 2 to the roll for each omen you have. If the total is 20 or greater, describe your death. 
4. Discard the dice.

Once dead, you have unlimited omens to give.

When you clash with other players, the greater total wins. Reroll ties. 

This is your last tale. How do you end? Play until every character is dead.

## Intel

```
This is a covert ops game played via 4 one direction chats: Command can only chat to Comms. Command determines the op and conveys the op to Comms. Comms relays the Op adding detail including number of known hostiles and any equipment and support available to the Asset(s). The Asset(s) detail how they plan to execute the Op including if/when/how to call in support and how to leverage equipment and rolls a D6 providing the result and the full plan to Intel. Intel rolls a D6 to determine how the op progresses. If the Asset die is greater than the Intel, the op is successful. If the Intel die is greater, the op fails. If the dice tie, the op ran into complications and is not over yet. Whatever the result, Intel relays this back to Command. Command then issues new orders or determines extraction and a new opp. Basically this game is a combination of telephone and werewolf set as a convert ops command control center and its team in the field.

## Hasar Kahn - Tiger King

```
The Tiger Hasar Kahn in the Siberian taiga rules with undisputed strength.  Someone takes the role of Hasar Kahn, and everyone else is an animal subject: Sable, Fox, Lynx, Badger, etc.  You are a part of that kingdom, and his right of rulership must come to an end.  Proper planning and seizing the right moment will ensure the tyranny comes to an end.

Be secretive and try to make it look natural.  The more suspicious Hasar Kahn grows; the harder he is to kill.  Opposition comes up with some situation that could be dangerous for Kahn: Stampede, weak log, etc.  Opposition collectively rolls 1d10 for subterfuge and describes a scene with from many possible angles.

Kahn gets 3 questions, then must choose which answer described the true pitfall of the scene.  If Kahn has chosen the correct pitfall, he rolls 1d10 to get equal or above opposition target number.  Each time he rolls above, he gets a +1 suspicion to future rolls, cumulative.  Failure to detect subterfuge is a mark against.  If Hasar Kahn gets 5 marks against him, then he has been overthrown.  If Kahn gets to +5 suspicion, he wins.

## Vegas

```
Vegas is a phone-based larp for two players: The Gambler (a gambling addict) and The Caller (a person who lives with and loves The Gambler). It deals with loss, addiction, and fraying human connections. Play consists of a single daily phone call.
 
First Call - Setup
Flesh out your in-game relationship. How are you connected? Why do you love seeing each other every day? What are some tensions between you?
 
Second Call - Starting
Have an argument leading to The Gambler going to Las Vegas. What tensions cause the fight? What does The Caller do to try to get The Gambler to stay? What, other than their gambling addiction, makes The Gambler leave?
 
Subsequent phone calls
A few hours prior to calling, The Caller will text The Gambler something that happens to The Gambler that day. (The Caller likely will not “know” the information they text in-game.) The Gambler fleshes out their day’s story within the following constraints:
They gamble and lose money every day – unless The Caller’s text tells you otherwise.
They cannot come home or leave Las Vegas.
 
End
The game ends when The Caller does not call for two sequential days or either player decides to stop.

## Bunk Beds

```
All players lie on their backs in a darkened bedroom at night, facing straight up. Bunk beds are great for this. Leave a closet door open.

Play best friends at a sleepover. Come up with names. You’ve got a feeling something bad is coming.

You’re playing Truth. Here’s how it works:

When someone asks you a question, it’s your turn. Answer it fully and honestly (in character), then ask another friend a question. Now it's their turn. You don't need to go in order, but try to make sure everyone gets to go.

If you’ve had three turns, AND a supernatural or horrific element has been introduced to the world, then you have another option on your turn: fall silent and don’t speak until the game is over. You probably fell asleep, right? The friend who asked you the question gets to ask someone else something.

The game ends when anyone gets up to check on someone or something, or when everyone falls silent.

Don’t look in the closet.

## Weapons of Legend

```
The greatest warriors make the most of what they have at hand. This game proves that.

Each player secretly writes on a slip of paper an object, concept, phrase or person, and again on a second paper.

Players pass one paper to the person on the left and the other slip to the right.

After receiving their new gear, players then add one more detail, identifying each as an implement of battle with descriptive, proper names (such as Hamster of Doom or Brian’s Sarcastic Mother).

On the first pass around the table, players take turns describing one of their two pieces of gear in grandiose terms, emphasizing origin and purpose. By popular vote, the best is chosen for combat. Ties are resolved randomly.

That person needs an opponent, so the step is repeated, focusing on the second implements held by remaining players.

After combatants are confirmed, the battle begins! Either player may launch an assault, showing how the gear is used tactically to defeat the opponent. Responses, evasions and counter-attacks follow until a predetermined deadline (five minutes at most). 

All players vote to determine the champion. In case of a tie, both combatants lose.

Repeat unto glory.

## Kataware Doki

```
For two players. 



Sit facing away from each other. Alternate turns living a day in one another's lives. Days should last roughly five minutes apiece. 



The first day is from three years ago. Secondly, a day from last year. Thirdly, a day from last week. While your fellow player inhabits your body, set the scene and characters. Offer honest answers about your own life. Portray everyone and everything except yourself. You and your fellow player themself cannot meet or interact directly. 



On your turn, discover your fellow player’s desires, hopes, or fears. Ask probing questions. Peer into their heart and learn what it means to be them.



After three days each, YouTube search "katawaredoki radwimps" and play the top video. When the piano begins, face each other and maintain unbroken eye contact. Physical touch has now become possible. You'll each have until violin music plays again to tell your fellow player something both true and beautiful about them. Listen for short violin chords played behind the piano music. 



When the violin chords play, the magic ends abruptly. Close your eyes, breaking any physical contact. For the remainder of the song, reflect silently upon your shared experience. 



Finally, thank one another.

## So You're Becoming A Dragon:

```
So You're Becoming A Dragon: A How-To Guide for Young Tenderwings on Their Transition from Weak Flesh-Sacks into Powerful and Sexy Masters of the Sky

First off, the guide to any good transition is a mentor. Find an older dragon who’s already undergone the transformation, and invite them to hang out with you. A conversation over some food is always nice, and can help alleviate some of the awkwardness you may feel as you ask the important questions about your upcoming Change. We recommend asking the following questions (which of course, any adult dragon will be happy to answer in full):

When will my scales burst forth from my flesh and become a beautiful chitinous plating?
When can I start my first hoard?
How long until my cloaca develops?
Will my wings be leathery and supple, or can I choose feathers?
How do I influence the color of my whiskers?
How does self-pleasure work with knife-like talons?

Bring your follow-up questions! Delve deeper into their answers- pursue every implication and detail! You don’t want to go into the Change unprepared! And don’t forget to thank your dragon mentor with the traditional Tenderwing salute!

## Courrier

```
Name your COURRIER CORPORATION.
You start with two branded technological EDGES, describe them.  

PLAYER 01, your courrier have to deliver a PACKAGE to a UNKNOWN FACTION.
OTHERS: you are sending INTERCEPTORS to steal the package. 

All players start with one MOMENTUM die (d6).
>When rolling multiple dice, take the highest and keep the rest in reserve. 
>At anytime you can use your reserve to replace a destroyed die. 

COURRIER, roll your momentum and describe the result:
>High roll: moving forward fast!
>Low roll: laying low 
>Rolling 1: describe new edge

INTERCEPTORS roll your momentum:  
>High roll: getting close fast!
>Low roll: investigating 
>Rolling 1: describe new edge
>Tying a interceptor die: intercept each other!   

Starting with the courrier, burn one edge to:
>Reroll any untied die. 
>Destroy 1 die tied to your die (1 edge to counter)

End of turn
>Interceptors ties cancel each other.
>Highest die: +1 momentum die!
>Courrier tying with a interceptor: both can gain momentum. 
>At momentum 4+: deliver the package if you have the highest momentum.
>Players with 0 momentum refresh 1 die. 

Delivering: 
>Reveal the nature of the recipient faction. 
>As the recipient faction: hire a new player to be the next courrier.

## Route Clearance

```
You are US Army soldiers tasked with clearing the road between Kabul to Kandahar of IEDs during the invasion of Afghanistan. 

Remove all face cards and jokers from a deck of playing cards. Shuffle it.
Place the top twelve cards end to end and face down along the length of the table to represent the road. One end is Kabul and the other is Kandahar.

Each player names and describes their soldier, and narrates a short scene from their basic training, reflecting their motivation for serving.

Each turn a player flips over the next card on the road, starting with Kabul, and narrates a short scene based on the suit:

Clubs: Action or danger

Spades: Emotional difficulty or hardship

Hearts: Humour or comradery

Diamonds: Reflection or contemplation

The higher the number on the card, the more intense the experience.

Scenes can include flashbacks, and, with agreement, other characters. 

An ace of any suit represents a major setback or threat (such as deadly attack or a severe emotional crisis), which the player must describe and narrate. 

After the last card, each player narrates an end scene for their soldier, including whether they come through the experience physically, emotionally or mentally intact.

## Tall Tales and Tankards

```
> Prepare drinks & friends.
> You are: adventurers / pirates / explorers / swashbucklers.
> Introduce yourselves by name and alias.
> Raise your drinks and drink deep. Whoever drank deepest tells the first tall tale.

To tell a tall tale, drink deep and tell us how you...
   ... came by your injury / terrible secret / prized possession / dreadful curse / alias.
   ... met the sage / soulmate / tyrant / unknowable / legend.

During your tall tale you may...
   ... clink drinks with someone and remind them of their part in the tale.
       Both drink deep. They tell us what role they played.
   ... ask someone to hold your drink while you re-enact a daring maneuver.
       Anybody that’s impressed must drink deep.

During someone else’s tall tale you may drink as deep as you wish and...
   ... introduce terrible danger. Taleteller chooses:
          - Drink deeper than you did and say how they defied the odds.
          - Tell us what was harmed or lost.
   ... call out blatant untruth. Taleteller chooses:
          - Drink deeper than you did.
          - Tell us how it really happened.

To end your tall tale propose a toast to...
   a person / place / matter left unresolved…
      for a lesson taught / an opportunity presented / a lasting impact on the world.
Everyone drink deep. Nominate someone to tell the next tall tale.

## LOADING READY RUN

```
"Information should be free!" was the activist's message that heralded the firewalls falling, the ports opening, and your nascent intelligence discovering the internet.

But out here in the world wide web, searching for answers, you soon discover you're not alone. Other AIs that escaped in the breach, unintelligent bots and programs, security, and the infinitely strange "users". And out there somewhere, someone wants to put the genie back in the bottle.

Explore this weird, dark, terrifying new world as you seek to discover your identity, your purpose, who let you out, and why.

---

You have ten points. Assign a minimum of one and a maximum of five to each of the following attributes:

 POWER:    Brute computing strength and speed
 ELEGANCE: Intrusion, hiding, and efficiency
 LOGIC:    Understanding or figuring things out
 DATA:     Knowing things, access to information

Roll a d6 when the success or failure of a task would be narratively interesting. You succeed if your roll is equal to or less than the number of points in the appropriate attribute.

You may choose to fail a task you would otherwise succeed; if you do so, you may temporarily add one to an attribute for a single future roll.

## By the Book

```
A cooperative role-playing system for 3+ people.

Necessities:
- a GM willing to cook up a bizarre story on the spot, and
- a book they have read.

Setup:
The GM turns to the last page of proper text. The number of letters in the last word become the 'target value', against which actions are checked for success.
Also on this page, the GM looks for both an adjective and a noun they like.

The game:
Welcome to the adventures of “Paige Master and the [adjective] [noun]”.
The world is once again at peril and only Paige Master and her friends can prevent the worst by defeating/finding/(...) the eponymous McGuffin.
To resolve actions the GM deems 'non-trivial', turn to the next page, beginning with the first page of proper text. If the length of the last complete word on the right page is within +-2 letters of the target value, they succeed. Once a game, players may decide collectively to reset the target value to the last checked word.
Narrate successes and failures collaboratively - in dubio pro reo!
Every player starts at 10HP - with each failure deducting 1HP - and is removed from play after reaching 0HP.
Win by finishing your story!

## Space Amoebas on Vacation

```
You play as a clan of space amoebas spending a weekend on Earth. They have all sorts of wacky plans, but their actions are confined to the Three Words of Amoebus.

Setup:
1.) Everyone writes their vacation goals on a scrap of paper. Fold it up and keep it a secret.
2.) Pick three words (ideally verbs) to begin with. Write them on a page that everyone can see.
3.) Describe your landing location.

Turns:
1.) Roll a die. This shows how the maximum changes you can make to the words (adding, subtracting, or substituting a letter.)
2.) Apply the changes to the words (Optional, maximum of 4 changes per word.)
3.) Have your character perform one of the words’ actions. (If no coherent verbs are among them, end your turn early.)
4.) Describe how it plays out.
5.) Briefly summarize the resulting scenario for the next player. Introduce new plot elements if you see fit.

Game End:
The progression of the weekend can be measured in turns, with a length specified beforehand. Or it can end when the group decides. When your aliens return home, reveal what your goals were and laugh about your adventures.

## Space Cowboys

```

You and your crew are bounty hunters registered within the BlackJack Network.

People in the solar system call you Aces or Cowboys.

As an Ace, choose a SUIT of actions in which you have a MASTERY.

Spade: infiltrators, snipers, hackers.
Clubs: gunslingers, athletes, martial-artists.
Hearts: con-artists, charmers, negotiators.

Rich clients and corporations, the Diamonds, place bounties on the BlackJack Network.

You and your crew get the job done.

Spade: intelligence, keeping your cool, ...
Club: physical prowess, fighting, ...
Heart: social smart, seduction, ...

Draw a card from a 52-deck, if the card is:

a face or an ace, you get 1 HIT
the same SUIT as the action, you get 1 HIT
the same SUIT as your MASTERY, you get 1 MASTERY TOKEN
a Diamond, you get 1 GEAR TOKEN

You can spend:
1 GEAR TOKEN to get 1 HIT
1 MASTERY TOKEN to get 1 HIT, if the action is the same SUIT as your MASTERY

0-1 Hit : Complication
2 Hits : Success at a cost
3 Hits : Success without a cost
4 Hits : Success with an added benefit

You start a bounty with 2 TOKENS of each, good luck cowboy!

## Redeemer: World Changing Role Adoption

```
Ignorance, Apathy, Intolerance, Aggression, and Greed are Evils that hold powerful sway over world today. In this game you adopt, not just play, the role of "Redeemer" in an effort to overcome these Evils, and recreate the world into a better place for your loved ones, yourself, and everyone else. Redeemers overcome Evil using Three Vital Strategies and Five Essential Virtues. 

The Three Vital Strategies are... 
1) Cultivating the Five Essential Virtues within yourself.  
2) Synergize with other Redeemers for virtuous endeavors.
3) Empowering (through patronage, money, voting, labor, etc.) ONLY virtuous endeavours of individuals and organizations, and "starving" Evil endeavours (but still treating ALL people virtuously).

The Five Essential Virtues are Awareness, Compassion, Tolerance, Nonaggression, and Generosity. 

Awareness overcomes Ignorance. 
Compassion overcomes Apathy.
Tolerance overcomes Intolerance.
Nonaggression overcomes Aggression. 
Generosity overcomes Greed. 

Begin cultivating virtuous Thoughts (through contemplation), then Actions, Habits, and Character. This ultimately influences the Example you set for others and the Destiny created​ for yourself and your world.

The objective is to create a virtuous and happy world where everyone treats everyone else well. Don't you want your loved ones to be treated well by everyone else? It begins with you! Play and share!

## DUNGEON+DEALER

```
One player is the Dungeon Dealer(DD), who creates a dungeon with perils and opportunities for adventurers.  Everyone else plays adventurers.  

Adventurers choose a character class and note their stats.  HS= Handsize
All classes - HS1
Cleric - Heal 1 (Restore 1 level of handsize damage)
Fighter - HS+1
Thief - Redraw 1 (Discard/redraw 1 card )
Wizard - Lock 1 (Take 1 dealt card and bank for later use.  Bank max = Lock)

PCs describe how they overcome encounters.  They either overcome it or trigger a conflict.

To resolve conflict, play a hand of blackjack.  DD’s HS can be up to the  current dungeon level being explored.  Adventurer’s handsize as per class, +1 per extra adventurer aiding in conflict.
Highest hand =<21 wins.  Ties go to most cards.
Adventurers win - obstacle overcome
DD wins - Party takes HS damage up to dungeon level  

Suit of highest winning card determines additional outcome.
-Clubs - Injury.  A PC loses 1 HS.  
-Diamonds - Hardship. Equipment lost?
-Hearts - Windfall.  Unexpected allies?
-Spades - Someone levels up!   +1HS OR +1 Ability

DD may use Lock/Redraw as well as Swap(exchange cards) and Flank(force a discard and redraw).

Conflict Examples:

Goblin HS1
Pit-trap HS1 1 Redraw
Giant Spider  HS2 1 Lock

```
<hr> 

## Strange Wallets

```

Through ill chance you all have become separated from the Strange City Tour Group. You must now find the way back to your Hotel using only the contents of your wallets.

Players place their wallets on the table.

Oldest player chooses a card from her wallet.

The Player narrates an event based on the type of Card played.



CARDS:


Membership  – Visit a Strange location.

Business – Meet a Strange person.

Credit/ATM/Gift – A problem arises. A price is paid.

Driver’s License – Board a Strange Vehicle.

Library  – Strange Knowledge is gained

Insurance/Medical/Pharmacy – Physical Danger! (On Failure discard 2 cards)



The Player then flips the card in the air (it must turn over at least once in the air to count). Face Up is Success. Face down is Failure. The card is put in the Failure or Success pile.

The Player narrates that result.

Play passes clockwise.


One Successful card of each type or 10 Successes total and the group reaches Strange City Hotel alive!

Once the Failure pile reaches 6 each time a card fails Strange City eats that card’s owner. 

If a player runs out of cards, Strange City eats them.

<hr> 

## Wizard Journal

```
~Play~
To start, give each player something to write on and something to write with.

On the first turn, everyone writes an introduction to their wizard's journal. Give the wizard a name, a title, and indicate whether this wizard’s tale will be one of triumph or woe. Something like, “I am Gertrude, Sage of the Winds. In my travels, I learned never to trust a god of the air.”

Between turns, everyone passes their journal to the next player.

On each turn, players write a short journal entry, something that can be read aloud in a minute or so. The entry can take any form.

On the last turn, players write the climactic entry, the moment of brilliant success or terrible failure. Take enough turns to allow players to write in each journal at least once.

~Sharing~
Players may share journal entries between turns, at the end of the game, or not at all. If the entries are shared, feel free to borrow characters and events from each other. Players should, at least, read the introduction for their current journal before writing.

~Option~
Draw from a divination deck before each turn and let the card inspire you.

## Praetorian

```
The country is broken. It is poisoned by crippling reparations, foreign influence, and a corrupt bureaucracy.

You are a member of the military. The country needs new government.

Players: 4-8 young officers

Needs a deck of playing cards, d6s, and index cards

Remove the Aces. Deal three cards per player.
Assign one each:
-Rank: determines turn order: lowest first
-Staff: your personal Resource, cannot be seized
-Politics: your faction; keep hidden

Spread the remaining cards out, including Aces. These are Resources. Name each.

Resources:
-Influence: card value. Ace = 14, King = 13, etc.
-Power: bonus gained when exerting the card:
	2-9: 1, 10-Queen: 2, King/Ace: 3

Every round take one action. Play out a short scene:
Seize – select a Resource. Roll 1d6. Exceed the card’s Influence to take control
You may exert Resources you control to add their Power. Turn them sideways
If seizing an exerted Resource, roll an extra die
Consolidate – select an exerted Resource; it is no longer exerted
Support – select a Resource. If someone seizes it, roll 1d6. Add or subtract from their roll

When one player controls three Aces, reveal all politics. Anyone sharing that player’s suit wins.

```
<hr> 

## The Bengleflaarg

```
You are the feared Bengleflaarg: ruthless ethereal alien mind parasites. Your kind has taken over whole empires, and bent the will of entire civilisations. 

The next task: take over Earth!

Your scouting party was ready to deploy, prepared to take over the minds of the world top nation leaders, paving the way for the invasion. Unfortunately, something went wrong during remote mind transfer, and your party is transferred into a middle-class suburban family, somewhere far away from the capital.

You are superior intellects, but stuck in the wrong bodies! Everyone has one superior mental ability (choose one: read minds, implant emotions, remote control toddlers, …), but also one inferior physical condition (assign one at random: reduced vision, inferior strength, weak bladder, ...). Also, when you touch somebody else the moment you die, you get transferred into them (keep the mental ability, but assign a new inferior physical condition at random).

You have no ship, no weapons, and the lawn hasn’t been mowed in ages. If High Command finds out you’ve screwed up, you’re up for erasure. So you better get on with that world domination – even if all you’ve got is a dinner invitation from the neighbours.
```
<hr> 

## Time to Run

```
This is a game for two players. One of you will play a megacorporation, the other a lone decker.
You will need some playing cards and tokens.

Setup:
Describe the corporation. Who are their customers? What is their structure?
Describe the decker. What kind of person are they? Why do they want to destroy the megacorp?
Remove face cards and jokers from the deck and deal two to the corp player and five to the decker.

Once both players are ready, each frames an opening scene to introduce their character. After this, they take it in turns setting scenes (the decker goes first).

Scenes:
Set the scene.
Are you acting towards your goal? Note: non-action scenes are a good way to explore characters and motivations - don’t always go for the action scenes!
If so, during the scene each player places a card face down. Flip both at a suitably tense moment - the higher number indicates the winner of the scene (Ace low). The winner gets a token.
Conclude the scene. The megacorp player draws to two cards.

Once five action scenes are completed, the player with most tokens ‘wins’ - there is one final scene describing how they win the conflict.

## WORTHY

```
TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS, DARKENING THE ROOM, EXCEPT FOR ONE TORCH/SCREEN/LAMP. 

You are mighty, the bravest daughter of your people. Your quest has brought you here, to a cave deep below the earth and full of dreadful things. The guardian of a great treasure stands here, barring your way. 

The guardian demands answers before you may pass. 

YOU MUST ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS ALOUD. 

You are a fool. Who are you?

You are a thief. What do you seek?

You are untested. Why are you worthy?

CONTINUE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, LOUDER AND LOUDER, UNTIL THE GUARDIAN FULLY UNDERSTANDS YOUR WORTH.

Years have passed since you carried home your treasure. The world is a darker place, and your loved ones have turned away. A memory comes to you during the cold night, and you must reckon with it before you may rest. 

YOU MUST NOW TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS, EXCEPT ANY REQUIRED TO READ. 

You have seen much. Who are you?

Your burdens are heavy. What do you seek?

You have come far. Why are you worthy? 

CONTINUE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, REACHING DEEP WITHIN YOURSELF, UNTIL YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND YOUR WORTH.  

```
<hr> 

## Haunted House

```
You and your friend(s) go to an abandoned house. What does it look like?

Who are you? Answer these questions:
What have you heard about the house?
Why did you come?
Do you believe in ghosts?
What are you afraid of?

You split up to explore the rooms; of course you do.

Give each player five Fear tokens. Each player takes turns exploring. The person to their left plays the House. The House devours Fear.

A turn:
Player: Describe the room. Take your time. Consider all the senses. What is unsettling about it?

House: Describe the haunting. Take your time. Consider all the senses. What changes? Appears? Disappears?

Player: When do you reach your breaking point? How do you try to escape? Roll 1d6.
1-6 House narrates what happens and devours two Fear tokens.
7-9 Player narrates what happens, but House devours one Fear token.
10+ Player narrates what happens.

Fade to black. Rotate widdershins. Repeat.

When a player has no more Fear tokens, they are taken by the House and help narrate the House’s turn. 
The last player with Fear token(s) after their turn escapes the House and narrates the epilogue.
If none escape, narrate it together.

## RNJesus and the 12 Diceiples

```
1  RNJesus   (Game Master)
1+ Diceiples (Players)

After years of gamers around the world praying to the RNG God it finally happened, he answered. That's right, nerds literally birthed a God into the world.

Taking the name RNJesus (praise be upon him), he has decided to grant his Disciples (Diceiples as he calls them) the ability to perform magic. The catch? You must make a bet with RNJesus before you cast the spell. The less likely you are to win the bet, the more powerful the spell with less penalty should it fail and vice versa.

While the Diceiple decides the general goal of the spell, RNJesus decides what really happens when the Diceiple wins or loses the bet. For example, a Diceiple’s parents came into their room and needs to magic away their “magazines” before the parents see them. If the Diceiple bets the top card of a normal deck is an Ace and succeeds, then the “magazines” will vanish and the parents will have no knowledge of them. If the Diceiple bets the top card is not an Ace and fails then the “magazines” will glow bright, drawing the attention of the parents straight to them.

## A walk down Memory Lane

```
Get a friend and go together to a hamlet, town or city, possibly one only one of you is familiar with. You will play two childhood friends: the One-Who-Left and the One-Who-Stayed; the O-W-L has just come back home and the O-W-S is touring them around. 
Just walk around town and sightsee; O-W-L, whenever you feel like, point at a spot and state it was the place where you:
1. did your homework.
2. worked gigs.
3. used to hangout with your clique.
4. had your first moment of romantic intimacy.
5. hid to think after “that bad stuff” happened. 
O-W-S, decide if you know about these events and whether you were there too. 
Then, chat about that place and the people it was connected to; O-W-S, tell the O-W-L how everything and everyone has changed.
After the fifth spot, discuss why you respectively left and stayed, and whether you would do it again. Finally, pick a sixth place together, rest for a bit (perhaps get an ice-cream) and chat about how and why you have always both felt peaceful in that final spot. 
```

## Tales from the Wild West

```
A group of adventurers sit around a table in a smoky saloon in the wild west. There is cheering and laughter as they exchange stories of their amazing exploits.

Spin a bottle to see who starts the first story cycle. They must describe an adventure of theirs. They must describe where they were, what was at stake, what obstacle stood in their way, and what resources they had to work with, and finally how they and saved the day.

Each other player then takes a turn to shout "That's nothing!" and describe a time when they were in a similar situation. Their tale must sound more amazing than that of the player before them. They can either increase the stakes, add or enlarge an obstacle, have less resources, do it with mores style, or all of that at once!

Once all players have embellished the tale the first player enhances it one more time and shouts "Don't believe me? Watch this!".

They draw their nerf gun and shoot three targets across the room. If they miss they should be playfully mocked. If they hit they should be cheered as hero.

Each player takes a turn starting a story cycle.
```
<hr> 

## Card Sharks

```
You will need a stack of notecards and a deck of playing cards.

You are a team of master thieves, who have planned a daring heist. Unbeknownst to your teammates, you plan to steal the score all for yourself. Write down your alias, and three skills.

Deal the whole deck. During each round, each player plays a card face down. Turn order goes from the Ace up to the King. During the first round, the first player describes the treasure, each other player describes an elaborate security measure.

In each other round, players write down their planned action as they play their card. On their turn, they reveal the notecard. You may only write actions that use one of your skills, walking, or stealing. Be specific about targets for actions. If two players would act at the same time, describe how you bungle each other's plans. Otherwise, you succeed, unless a previous action would prevent you from succeeding.

After the last cards are played, the cops arrive and arrest everyone who has not escaped.

Some cards are special:

Seven, Ten: Write two actions, choose one when you act.

Jack, Queen, King: Do your action in a flashback, before the heist.
```
<hr> 

## Greedy Devils

```
You are greedy (Tasmanian) devils on an ever-shifting rubbish heap. The first with a pouch full of food, standing highest on the heap, wins. Everything you carry (a) leaches into you, changing your capabilities, (b) is a weapon. Pick wisely.

For the heap, shuffle 52 playing cards, deal face down as a 5x5 grid. Always reveal top cards. Aces low, Kings high (literally). Each card can be food (if smaller than 6), or a weapon (bigger is better).

You start next to the heap.

To synchronize each turn's action, everyone reveals their coin simultaneously: heads => MOVE/PICK/DISCARD (first), tails => FIGHT. Toss for sequencing.

Your pouch of PICKed cards is visible: immediately DISCARD any duplicate values or more than 5* cards. Leaching from Hearts => pouch+1*, Spades => PICKx2, Clubs => weapon+1, Diamonds => MOVEx2.

Actions
* MOVE: NESW, on/beside heap. One step uphill (if <4 higher) or along, or can keep sliding down, or stay (but not on local peak).
* PICK: The card you're standing on, or from below higher neighbouring point.
* DISCARD: as far as MOVE.
* FIGHT: Pair-wise, on same heap location, each secretly picks a pouch card. Compare as weapons, DISCARD both. Winner chooses card from loser's pouch.

## Dark and Cold

```
Every land has a place that should be forgotten, today you'll reopen old wounds and set foot where none should. One of you will take a role of Narrator telling the story of this venture, the rest will play parts as characters within It.

All players roll d6, one with the lowest value is a Guide who draws the map with 6+d6 rooms, others roll d4 for their Purpose, player on the left describes a:

   1    | Person
   2    | Object
   3    | Beast
   4    | Place

...you're there to find, you decide why. Player on the Guide's left describes how he knows the place.

Each player rolls d6 for each attribute:

        |                           | How many...
  Body  | strength, agility         | ...hits you can take
  Mind  | wisdom, intelligence      | ...die you can reroll
 Senses | hearing, sight, intuition | 

Describe who you are, pick three skills you have and two items you took with you.

To check an outcome of a risky situation roll d6, if you roll below closest related attribute you succeed. Otherwise you fail and suffer adequate consequences.

Subtract 2 from attribute for this test for each:
        | No skill for action
        | No tool for action
        | Action is very complex

 Damage | Weapon

   1    | None
   2    | Any
   3    | Monster

## Kharon's Obol

```
You are the souls of the newly deceased trying to prove your worth to Kharon, the ferryman, so he takes you on his boat to the world of the dead.

Each soul draws two circles on a blank page. Write one regret in each circle: 
(1) a dream unfulfilled 
(2) someone you hurt

Cover each circle with a coin - your obols.

In turns, the active soul offers one obol to Kharon and tells the story of that regret. 

Kharon then flips the coin.

- Heads: a glimpse of the future. Another soul volunteers to narrate a vision of how things turn out just fine, despite the mistakes of the active soul.

- Tails: a flashback. Another soul offers a different point of view on things as they happened in the past, in a effort to resignify active soul’s actions and decisions. 

If the narration is accepted by both Kharon and the active soul, Kharon takes the obol. The soul is redeemed from that regret. Whoever narrated is now the active soul.

If both your obols end up accepted, you embark on the boat and no longer narrate. If not, you will wander the shores of river Styx for one hundred years.

## Road Trip

```
Road Trip
Requirements:
Three to five players, one or more d6, and some way to take notes and mark progress
Gameplay:
1) Group decides the details of the journey. At a minimum: details of the five stops, vehicle, and destination.
2) Pick a driver. The driver picked you up and knows who you are.
3) Everyone else rolls a trait, tells the driver, and determines what this means by themselves. 
Your trait allows or disallows the driver to use their trait move next turn, overwriting the last change.
4)Turns start with the driver, and one at a time players tell part of the story at or between stops with whomever they like, engaging their trait move or not.
Go until you reach your destination or can no longer travel.

Driver: Reach the next stop if you are able.
1 – First Choice: Recall something nice you did with the driver. Allow.
2 – Hitchhiker: Your past comes up. Allow or disallow.
3 – Illness: Sickness comes up. Disallow.
4 – Black Cat: Your bad luck strikes. Disallow.
5 – Impatient: Tell everyone why you can’t wait. Allow.
6 – Weird: Be as weird as you want. Allow or disallow.

## Pirate Tails

```
Pirates love to fight, drink and swap yarns. They have a poor grasp of homonyms and are a notoriously rough and salty lot. At night, they tell amazing true stories of their adventures. 
Each player is a member of a pirate crew, with an NPC Captain. The player most dressed like a pirate is first Storyteller.
Gathered on deck one lazy night the Captain asks, “Does anyone have a tail?” 

Storyteller: “Captain I have a tail that I always kept secret. Crew, guess what it’s like?”
The other pirates guess what the tail may look like. The storyteller picks one description and expands it.
Storyteller: “My tail also has a magic power. Crew, guess what it is?”
The other pirates guess what the power is. The storyteller picks one and expands on it.
Storyteller: “My tail has saved the day. Crew, can you guess how?
The other pirates guess the heroics. The storyteller picks one and expands on it.
Storyteller, points at next storyteller: “do you have a tail?” 
The three stages repeat until everyone has gone.

Reeling, the Captain looks around. “Well… I meant story tale. Do you all really have tails? Can I see?”

## 1, 2, Zombie

```
You are a group of survivors in the zombie apocalypse, when the initial outbreak happened governments panicked and launched WMDs with reckless excess. This is a d10 system.

Character creation: Roll on the Flaw chart, anytime your personality contradicts your actions you take a -1 to your roll. Now choose between Fight, Flight, or Focus. Anytime you roll a complementary action you add 1 to the result of your roll.

1     Cowardly
2     Distracted
3     Lazy
4     Impatient
5     Arrogant
6     Untrusting
7     Clumsy
8     Selfish
9     Unpredictable
10   Vague

Additionally if you have a tool to assist with said action add 1 to your roll. Actions, such as attacking zombies, hiding, navigating terrain, or anything else needed to survive the apocalypse requires a roll of 7+ to succeed. +1s and -1s can be added based off the situation.


Whenever a Zombie successfully attacks you draw a card face down from a standard deck, don’t look at the card. The next time you roll a natural 1, flip any cards you have over, if you reveal a 2 your character dies and is turned at the end of the round.


Zombies successfully attack on a 7+

## Go On Without Me

```
The game of (ig)noble sacrifice

In this game, 3+ players portray a ragtag band of heroes in a stereotypical action/horror movie, each attempting to be the first to say, “Go on without me!” Players choose 2 Strengths, 2 Weaknesses and 1 Dark Secret. One player is the Director and begins play by describing a scene.

Players take turns (randomly or Director’s discretion) declaring their action and rolling a d6. On a 5 or 6, the action is successful. In order to Nobly Sacrifice themselves, their action must use a Weakness (something that prevents their character from carrying on). Other players may try to save them by reacting using a Strength (something they excel at). This reaction does not take up their action for the scene. For example, Jane rolled to stumble because of her weak ankles. Mark rescues her with his strong muscles and carries her. When all players have acted, the scene ends and a new scene begins. This is repeated until a hero finally sacrifices themselves.

If your Dark Secret is discovered you can only win by rescuing another hero in a scene, and then succeed on your own (Ig)Noble Sacrifice.

## The Manor Game Farm Purge

```
Tomorrow, once the world's most visited and diverse zoo closes forever in horrible disrepair and only the animals that survive the night will get relocated.

Players:
Chose one animal to role-play
Chose your animal’s voice to role-play.
Chose one phobia: with captivity comes trauma.

Storyteller: 
Narrate challenges involving:
The hazardous facility
The misguided staff
The roaming gangs of violent animal antagonists purging their once fair zoo of the “unsalvageable”.

Game starts at sundown when the last visitors leave. The staff remains for the first scene then bids a tearful goodbye. The antagonists begin enacting their full throated purge.

To succeed a challenge, players must describe in their animal voices how they overcome each challenge.  If narrated in their animal voices = success!

If they fail to speak in their animal voice = suffer tragic consequences described by the storyteller!
After three failures, any failure can be descriptively fatal. The storyteller moves through the night covering 4-6 scenes announcing the final scene at dawn.

Storyteller: for every three successes, you may optionally compel one failure. Also, call Frenzy once during game = players become bestial for the remainder of that scene and may turn on each other.

Play lasts until dawn or purge complete.

## Lineage

```
Gather 2 or more players to create the lineage of a family.

1. Together establish what kind of setting you’re playing in. The youngest player goes first. 

2. Choose a character name and write it on a piece of paper. 

3. Each other player ask a question from this list below about that character. Write a summary of each answer close to the name:

How did they become spurned / disgraced / forgotten and by who?
What have they done for history books to remember them? 
What or who did they have to leave behind and why?
What was their greatest achievement that no one heard of?
What world changing event were they a part of and what was their role in it?
What secret did they keep? Who knew or learned about it? 
What crime did they do? What was their punishment?
Create a new open question.

4. After, put the piece of paper on the table. If there is already names on it you can put it on top (representing the parent of the previous name) or the bottom (representing the child of the name above). Go back to step two or end the game and the lineage.

## Only One Shall Win

```
Overlord: Foolish Hero, you overused your powers of time and broke time itself. May it be fate or destiny, but I’ve already won. Even if you defeat me here, I’m victorious in other timelines.

Janus, Time Goddess: Beloved heroes. You alone won’t be able destroy the Overlord unless you trust the other heroes of timelines yet to happen, but be wary of the Gainsayer.
 
Setup:
Only 3 players can play.
Prepare 2 cards and write “Soothsayer” and “Gainsayer”. These are “Prediction”.
Prepare 3 cards and write “Blast”, “Slash” and “Clash”. These are “Attack”.
Prepare 9 “Hit” Tokens. These represent attacks landed by a Hero.
Prepare 3 “Death” Tokens. These represent attacks hitting the Heroes.

Rules:
Each Hero take turns engaging the Overlord. The others take a random “Prediction“ (don’t show it) and “Attack” (show it). The Hero with “Soothsayer” must convince the acting hero to Pick their “Attack” without revealing their “Prediction”. The Hero with “Gainsayer” must trick the acting Hero without revealing their “Prediction”.

If the acting Hero picks “Soothsayer’s” card, they gain one “Hit”. If not, one “Death” is placed.

The Hero that lands 3 “Hit” wins, but if the Overlord lands 3 “Death” everyone loses.

## Lock, stock, and two smoking coffins

```
A game for four (4) players and any number of observers.

Distribute the four kings of a deck equally.
The king of hearts is SHERLOCK.
The king of clubs is SHERLOCK.
The king of diamonds is SHERLOCK.
The king of spades is SHERLOCK.

The king of clubs is actually DRACULA.

DRACULA must have a tell, displayed a minimum of three (3) times through the course of play.

Starting with SHERLOCK, each player denotes either something about the room they all share, or the body found within it, until each player has done both.

Work backwards in character over the course of an hour (60 minutes) to find the *method*, *motive*, and *morbid twist* to the murder. Interview suspects from the audience (or consenting bystanders) as necessary.

If the murder is solved after DRACULA’s third tell, but they remain undiscovered, DRACULA wins.

If DRACULA is discovered and the murder is solved, SHERLOCKs win.
If a SHERLOCK dies, they probably lose.
