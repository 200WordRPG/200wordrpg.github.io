This page won't save anything, so make sure to back it up somewhere else.

Check the wordcount and formatting of your entry. The box below is a good way to **preview how your entry will look.** Keep in mind that the website will re-size itself depending on the size of the screen being used. For example, [Instant Adventures Generator](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2016/supplement/2016/04/14/InstantAdventuresGeneratorpocketedition.html) looks great on a very wide screen, but will be squished on a phone.

### Entry Requirements:

* **Entries must contain 200 words or fewer.** Any entry with more than 200 words will be rejected. Type your entry into the wordcounter below to make sure it is valid.
* **Entries must be written in the English language.** Entries in other languages will be rejected.
* **No emojii's, no chinese characters, etc.** Only [Basic Latin Characters](http://www.isthisthingon.org/unicode/?page=X0&subpage=0) are allowed. *Unicode x0000 through x00FF for the nerds out there.*
* **Links will be ignored.** Entries must stand on their own. Judges will ignore links to other material and will not conduct additional research beyond reading your entry. *i.e. saying "It's like Moldvay Basic but with ascending AC" might not mean anything to the Judge.*
* **What counts as a word?** The specific word rules are listed in the box below. Delete what's there to check your own wordcount. *Any "ASCII Art" that displays as a word will be counted by the judges, even if it doesn't show up in the counter below.*
