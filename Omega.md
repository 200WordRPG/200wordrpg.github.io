# 2017 Finalists

## Happily Ever Maybe

```
You are a magic fairy! Describe your looks, name, temperament, and your one simple magic ability. 

Together, your fairy team must help one poor peasant achieve their happy ending in a classic fairy tale setting!

Each player gives one character element about the peasant and two details that would make the peasant’s life better. Count out red d6s equal to the number of happy ending details the group described. Do the same with white d6s. Place all dice in a bag. 

The oldest fairy begins the game. Declare how you wish to help the peasant with one of their details. Draw from the bag. A white die means success; a red means failure. Narrate the outcome. 

Pass the bag left, choose a new detail and draw again.

If you draw two red in a row, the peasant is physically harmed. Draw three and they die. Describe how.

When you have drawn all the WHITE dice, your peasant get’s their happily ever after, but draw all the RED dice and they don’t. Describe how.  

At the end of the story, have each fairy give one part of an epilogue describing a good or bad ending as represented by the dice.

## The Chronicles of...

```
One player introduces themselves as the Archivist; traveller, tale-keeper, and stranger to these lands. Your clothes are well-worn and foreign; your pack is heavy with inks and tomes. Wandering, you’ve happened upon a small group of local people. Describe yourself to them.

The other players are inhabitants of this land, full of tales and histories. Take a moment together to discuss what makes this place unique, then tell the Archivist what you call it. Describe your immediate surroundings and why you’re there.

The Archivist asks questions, prompting stories about the land and its people.

While an inhabitant tells a story, another may say, “Isn’t it the case that…” The storyteller (or someone else) will either revise the story, working in this detail, or explain how that is, in fact, not that case.

If an inhabitant has personal knowledge on a matter, they may say “You’re lying, here’s the truth…” The storyteller (or someone else) will either recant, reworking the tale in light of this, or refute the claim.

At any time the Archivist may ask for more details, or say, “In [another land, giving details] they say that…” The inhabitants will acknowledge or deny any relation.

## All For One, the flipped RPG

```
One player plays the hero. The rest are storytellers, who distribute these roles between themselves:
Architect: Sets the scene when the hero arrives somewhere. Moderates movement in the space.
Historian: Responsible for backstories, items and oddities. Adds details to the broad strokes of the Architect.
Foil: Roleplays the major NPC in each scene. Assigns minor NPCs to other storytellers, giving them: Personality or mood, Desire (what they want), and Conflict (what or who they’re struggling with).
Judge: Rules on challenges and conflicts (use any game system, or none). Assigns responsibilities to other storytellers as needed.
Director: Keeps an eye on plot and momentum. Introduces events or changes locations if things stagnate.
 
Before play, the hero player takes ONE MINUTE to describe their hero, then leaves the room. The storytellers sketch out the plot, led by the Director, spending ONE MINUTE on each of:
>Where is the hero? Why? What occurrence will draw them into the story?
>What obstacles will the hero face? Who or what will aid them? How will the story change them?
>How does the story end? How does this reflect the changes within the hero? How does it resolve the occurrence that began the story?
 
Play begins!
```

## Ex Libro

```
In Ex Libro, players choose characters from novels, trying to find objects or characters held in another book. That other book, the setting, is controlled by the gamemaster.

Preparation: Choose a book ≈300 pages*.

Gamemaster: Read through your chosen book, flagging locations, scenes, characters. Tell the players your book. Create or find any helpful supplements (maps, etc). Choose an object or character from each player’s book to rescue. Identify where in your book these are located.

Players: Read through your chosen book, flagging helpful actions and reactions of your character. Tell the gamemaster your book and character.

Gameplay: The Gamemaster runs characters through the GM’s novel, roleplaying the setting, NPCs, etc. The players roleplay their character. Players choose lines from their novel to resolve conflicts. Once a line is quoted, it cannot be reused, and you cannot choose lines from earlier pages. Characters vanish and return to their novels if they get their quested object, die, or run out of pages. 

*For every 50 pages over, players may not use lines from the first 25. For every 50 pages under, they may at any point jump back 25 pages to choose lines, but they still can’t reuse any lines.
```

## Fatimah's Busy Day

```
The youngest player is Fatimah.  

Others play her anthropomorphic burqa, Amir.  

Fatimah is running errands before going on a trip.  

Using the prompts below as guidelines, play out scenes from Fatimah’s day.

[Open-Air Market], [Alleyways]

Fatimah’s world is blue-tinted, because Amir is blue, but Amir can see its true colors.  Amir, describe these to her as she travels, highlighting details that her screened saccades miss.  

[Open-Air Market], [Alleyways], [Mosque]

Fatimah’s world is dangerous, because people are desperate and violent, but Amir protects her from harm.  Amir, tell how you turn away gazes, camouflage her movements, and render her invisible to potential bad actors.  

[House], [Graveyard], [Alleyways]

Fatimah’s friends and family are in turmoil, because the world is bleak.  They are upset that she is going away.  They grasp at Fatimah.  Amir, tell Fatimah how they feel, but be mindful of her feelings, too.

Whenever Amir speaks, everyone talks all at once.  Through the noise, Fatimah chooses which narratives to silence, one by one, by saying “Hush...” and the speaker’s name.  The remaining narrative(s) become what is real.  When ready, Fatimah can silence everyone—and just exist—before ending the scene.

End play when Fatimah leaves for her trip.

## Feast

```
PREPARATION
Five Players.
 
Everyone: Choose one basic taste: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, umami.  Prepare food or drink representing it. Each taste must be chosen.
 
Make enough of each food for one bite-sized morsel for every player. Place morsels in the center of the play area.
 
PLAY
1) You are all entities consuming a different individual’s personality. For example: alien parasites, sentient fungi, demons, ghosts.
 
2) Use one food item to inspire your host’s identity.
 
3) Each round, in turns, eat one morsel and recount a memory or thought you consume from your host, related to the flavor you eat.
 
-Sweet: friendship or love
-Salty: personal triumph
-Bitter: regret for one’s own actions
-Sour: sadness about an event or circumstance
-Umami: a contribution to an individual or the world
 
4) Each round, relate your host’s memory or thought…
 
Round 1: …the moment they were infected
Round 2: …they haven’t touched in a while
Round 3: …they shared with someone close to them
Round 4: …they return to repeatedly
Round 5: …they revisit right before their personality is extinguished
 
5) Do not eat the same food more than once. When all morsels are eaten, you have subsumed your host’s consciousness.

## Laughter or a Lit Flame: A Hack of Renga

```
Here I have a game:
Paper, pens, and three players.
It's simple to play.

First Player writes a haiku
That describes a character.

Inspire love or hate.
Make us laugh. Or nod, silent.
Good haiku delights.

Player Two writes a waki,
(Two lines, both of seven beats).

Describe there events
That befall the character.
Tragic? Exciting?

Hide the haiku from our sight.
Fold it back or cover it.

The third player's turn?
Haiku of a character,
Waki-affected.

Now hide the waki from view.
It's player one's turn again.

On each turn, you write.
First respond to what you see,
Then hide what you saw.

Alternate. Haiku. Waki.
Maintain silence as you write.

Or else, talk of things
Unrelated to the game 
TV shows, your day.

Haikus invent the people:
Lives impacted by events.

Wakis are events
That change everything for
Our small poem-folk. 

When you’ve written five times each,
Reveal all and read aloud.

Whoever read then
Sits in silence. And so
Must the other two.

The silence can be broken
By laughter- or a lit flame.
```

## MECHANICAL ORYX

```
You have many whirring eyes and strong, beautiful coiled-steel legs and were made long ago when the cities still stood. 

You spread one: plants, light, music, warmth, power, knowledge, rust, something else. The longer you stay in one place, the more intense it gets. You have three installed modules; tell us what they do.

You walk the green places where soft brown people tend to fruit-trees and sing songs they don’t understand. 

They pray: DISPEL THE CURSE ON OUR VILLAGE; DESTROY THE PHANTOMS THAT PLAGUE US; TEACH US THE SONG THAT MAKES THE FRUIT GROW.

When you act and the outcome is in doubt, roll 2D6 and spend fuel; if you get seven or more, you achieve your aims. If you roll a double, your solution causes an unexpected problem and something is lost forever. 

When you act with love, roll 1D4+1D6. When you act with hate, roll 3D6.

You have 10 fuel. When you have none, you stop.

When you use a module, replace one D6 with a D8; if it shows 8, the module breaks.

Happy people build shrines for you containing fuel and modules. Without the shrines, you will become a dangerous, scavenging thief: a phantom.

## Might Makes Right: Muscle Marines in Space

```
You are Muscle Marines, charged with keeping the universe awesome.

Setup
The strongest player is the Muscle Master (MM), who runs the game, describing situations and people. 

Everyone else is a Muscle Marine. Name your Marine and write down four personality traits, six skills, and a Muscle Marine Profession (e.g. Muscle Pilot, Muscle Negotiator, Muscle Tactician).
 
Conflict
When you are in conflict, arm wrestle the MM. If a skill or profession applies to the conflict, use your good arm, otherwise use your bad arm (when mismatched, use palm to back of hand). If you win, your character overcomes the obstacle. If you lose, do 10 push-ups (seven if you are roleplaying a personality trait) and continue play. If you can’t finish the full set, you must hit the showers and are out of the game.
 
Muscle Missions
1.       Rescue a space gym from the Evil Beancounter Alliance.
2.       Help the Fitness Federation move into a cool new pad.
3.       Throw a Spacetacular party for your buds at the beach (watch out for space sharks).
4.       Put a stop to the SpaceSteroid Crisis of 2374.
5.       Bring the great science of healthy eating to Gluttonia

## The Human World

```
For five people, played inside a shopping mall. 

Humans died out a century ago – all except one child put in cryosleep. Now that child has awoken and is in the care of androids programmed by the deceased parents to teach their child about the world in their absence.

Time has taken its toll on the androids. They’ve malfunctioned and view the world in extremes. The androids are:

A, who was meant to critique and analyze art, but now sees everything they encounter as art.

D, who was meant to see the influence of the divine in everything, but now believes the divine created every single thing for very specific reasons.

S, who was meant to encourage an appreciation of science, but now thinks every experience is a psychological experiment.

N, who was meant to balance the others out with healthy skepticism, but is now a nihilist who believes nothing has meaning.

The mall exists in virtual reality. The Child approaches a store or object and the androids must argue their case for why it fits their worldview. The Child awards a point to whoever is the most convincing. The android to be awarded seven points first wins.

## No Coincidence

```
Years ago, the world ended. You tell us how.
Both of us survived. I tell us why.
Both of us are walking across unpopulated lands. You tell us why.
We don't walk alone. We each say who we travel with, why they can't survive alone, and why we protect them.
In the distance, we spot each other. There is recognition: this isn't the first time we've crossed paths. I tell us how our last meeting started, you tell us how it ended.
We are dangerous people. You tell us why.
We haven't let the apocalypse take our humanity. I tell us why.
We are near each other now, us two and our companions. We each place a coin in our fist. Heads up, we are peaceful. Tails up, we are violent. We reveal our coins at the same time.
If I chose Heads, and you chose Tails, I tell us how you killed me, and you tell us why.
If you chose Heads, and I chose Tails, vice versa.
If we both chose Tails, you tell us how our companions go on without us.
If we both chose Heads, I tell us why we'll meet again.

- Sabotaged character strikes one line from their warrior haikus.

When all lines from your warrior haikus are stricken, your warrior is dead. Choose one:
- Write a glorious haiku commemorating the death.
- Write a demon-inspired spiteful haiku. Any characters you choose strike one line from their warrior haikus.

Rotate to new focal characters.

End when one or none stands alive.

## Squamous

```
You are each eldritch abominations, taking human form for nefarious purposes.  Your human vessels are… weak.  Disgusting. Meat. Always sweating, defecating, desiring. How do humans tolerate this?


Each abomination has a secret eldritch Goal.  Write down a noun and a verb.  Give the noun to your left-hand player and the verb to your right-hand player.  Combine the noun and verb you receive for your Goal. Take 15 d6s. You succeed at your Goal when you have no dice.

Describe your human appearance and identity.


Each player has authority over a human Need. Things like hunger, hygiene, sexual desire, romance, social acceptance. Name yours.


Take turns framing scenes where you perform tasks to achieve your Goal. Other players roleplay NPCs, describe scenery, etc.  

When they describe how their Need complicates your task, they offer 2-5 dice.  Roll one die. 

If you roll higher than the number of offered dice, the Need causes problems. Take the offered dice.  

If you roll lower, you resist the urge. That player takes back their dice and the die you rolled.  

If you roll equal, then you succeed at your task even while still succumbing to the Need. Discard all rolled and offered dice.

## 29 Days to Spring

```
An attempt to understand the perspective of the men in the battle for Iwo Jima

Western Child (CW): describe maturing in 1920’s America. Your old man talks about the Great War, what does it mean to you?

Eastern Child (CE): describe maturing in 1920’s in Japan. Your father tells you to honor your family, what does this mean to you?

CW: Your brothers are ready to take the beach. Your brothers are real, those animals are not. Nevertheless, how do you survive as they kill your brothers?

CE: The enemy approaches, promising destruction. They do not see your imminent ambush. How does this make you feel?

CW: Brothers fallen. Alone. Hated enemy in hiding. One attacks! A stab in the side. What rushes through your mind?

CE: You rush the enemy as commanded. Home. Family. Honor.  He shoots back into you as you rush, impaling him. Knowing it is the end, what are your thoughts?

## Five Cards

```
Referee designs adventure. Challenges defined in terms of the number of success needed to overcome them.

Players get 10 cards. 5 Action Cards:

Success with complication
Complete success
Failure with benefit
Complete failure
Standoff

And 5 blank Character Cards. They define their Character by writing 5 things on them. 

Referee gets 5 cards:

Referee claims card
Player retains card
Card goes to another Player
Card discarded
Player vote

Referee describes the setting. Players state actions. When Characters face a challenge, player draws random Action Card. Results interpreted by Referee. Failure may cause wound - turn a Character Card over. Successes/benefits may heal wounds.

Referee draws a random Referee Card to determine what happens to the player's Action Card. The Referee can take no proactive actions until they have gained at least one action card. They then have two piles of cards.

Player and the Referee shuffle their card piles. Action moves to next Player.

If a Player has no Action Cards and their Character has a wound, they are dead. 

Play continues until the adventure is over or all Action Cards are discarded.

## Nightblind

```
Night fell many years ago. It is the duty of the blinded to thrive, and thus show the sun that it is not needed. The sun is wicked and jealous, and sends monsters to corrupt and kill.

Everyone has a piece of paper on which they write down two skills that they excel at.

Everyone except for one person must then close their eyes.

This one person is the Sightseer. It is their sacred duty to describe the actions of the world and to roll the die.

When one of the blinded undertakes a risky action, the Sightseer rolls one six sided dice. The action succeeds on 5 or above, and fails otherwise. If the action uses a skill, the target is set at 3 and above. The Sightseer will report only if the action succeeded or failed.

Unfortunately, the Sightseer represents the damned sun, and is prone to lie. If a blinded wishes to challenge the Sightseer, they must first announce it, then they may open their eyes.

If the blinded is correct, their success is assured and they may close their eyes.

If the blinded is incorrect, they must replace the Sightseer in their cursed duty.

## Memoriam Ignis

```
Magic is sad and beautiful. A chance to express yourself fully and make a difference, at the cost of your mind. Will you journey to make the world a better place? Or will you lord your powers over others? And more importantly, will you even still be "You" in the end?

Before your journey as a Wizard begins, commit to paper (Bond Paper recommended) your most treasured memories, enough to fill it with only a half-inch above, the sides, and bottom blank. Your SpellMaster (GM) then prepares a candle in front of you. As your journey starts he invokes the Spirit of Magic by bringing the candle alight. Your SpellMaster guides you on your odyssey and advises you in the manner in which your memories must be kindled in the Spirit of Magic to bring your spells to life. The more complex the spell you've described, the longer your memories stay wreathed in the Spirit of Magic and burned away. 

At the end of your adventure, when your SpellMaster extinguishes the Spirit of Magic, check how much you still remember of your old life. Are you still you? Are you better? Are you worse? And was it worth it?

## TROLLS

```
You are a troll: an under-the-bridge, ugly-as-sin, billy-goats-gruff troll.
 
Fortunately, you chose a bridge with a good wifi connection.
 
Make up an internet handle and write it down for everyone to see.
 
In secret, write down three physical aspects about which you, the troll, are extremely insecure. DO NOT draw on you, the player’s, insecurities.
 
The last troll to finish their list starts by stating their opinion on a topic, real or imaginary.
 
SPEAK ONLY IN TROLLSPEAK.
 
CALL CHARACTERS ONLY BY THEIR HANDLE.
 
IT IS YOUR JOB TO PURIFY THE INTERNET OF WRONGNESS.
 
DO THIS BY INSULTING OTHERS' LOOKS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE.
 
WHENEVER SOMEONE MENTIONS ONE OF YOUR ASPECTS, EVEN IF NOT AT YOU, YOU MUST RESPOND IMMEDIATELY.
 
NO PHYSICAL CONTACT WHATSOEVER.
 
If any troll thinks they have figured out someone else’s aspects, they can yell "BLOG POST", at which all other trolls must fall silent while the first enumerates those aspects.
 
If right, the attacked troll cannot blog post anymore. If wrong, the same happens to the attacker.
 
Play continues until only one troll can still blog.
 
End with a group pact "by the name of [winner's handle]" never to speak or write as you have just done.

## Kataware Doki

```
For two players. 



Sit facing away from each other. Alternate turns living a day in one another's lives. Days should last roughly five minutes apiece. 



The first day is from three years ago. Secondly, a day from last year. Thirdly, a day from last week. While your fellow player inhabits your body, set the scene and characters. Offer honest answers about your own life. Portray everyone and everything except yourself. You and your fellow player themself cannot meet or interact directly. 



On your turn, discover your fellow player’s desires, hopes, or fears. Ask probing questions. Peer into their heart and learn what it means to be them.



After three days each, YouTube search "katawaredoki radwimps" and play the top video. When the piano begins, face each other and maintain unbroken eye contact. Physical touch has now become possible. You'll each have until violin music plays again to tell your fellow player something both true and beautiful about them. Listen for short violin chords played behind the piano music. 



When the violin chords play, the magic ends abruptly. Close your eyes, breaking any physical contact. For the remainder of the song, reflect silently upon your shared experience. 



Finally, thank one another.

## Masters of the universe

```
You are all investment bankers. You each start with 3 coins, and you choose one of those coins and place it under your hand, with either heads or tails showing.

One person starts as the lead banker and tosses a coin. When it lands, everyone reveals their hands. Anyone who guessed correctly keeps their coin. Anyone who guessed incorrectly has to pass their coin on to the next person to their right who guessed correctly. 

The person with most coins at this point is the new lead banker. Everyone takes a turn to praise the lead banker for their skill and cleverness. The person who is most effusive, clever or funny must be rewarded with one of the lead bankers coins.

The process is then repeated until only one player has all the coins.

Anyone who loses all their coins in a round is out of the game and narrates the story of their downfall.

The last player with all the coins is declared the Master of the Universe.
```
<hr> 

## Memories

```
You are elderly people in a Nursing home. No one comes to see you anymore. You want to talk with others, tell them about your life, your dreams, and your memories.

Sit around a table. Get nine matches and an ashtray. Cut a paper sheet in nine pieces and write a word in each piece. These words are your conversation topics.

CHILD  LOVE  SPOUSE  WORK  FRIEND  GAME  TRAVEL  GRANDCHILD  HOME

One of you take a piece of paper and begins to talk about the topic in it. While speaking he lights a match and set fire to the paper in the ashtray. All of you talk about the proposed topic until the paper is consumed. Then a new elder takes another piece of paper and proceeds in the same way, but all of you have forgotten your memories related to the previous topic. You cannot use them in the new conversation. If the memories are necessary (for example, you must have CHILD in order to have GRANDCHILD), you must justify it in another way.

Finish when the nine pieces of paper have been burned —and, with them, all your memories.

```

## So You're Becoming A Dragon:

```
So You're Becoming A Dragon: A How-To Guide for Young Tenderwings on Their Transition from Weak Flesh-Sacks into Powerful and Sexy Masters of the Sky

First off, the guide to any good transition is a mentor. Find an older dragon who’s already undergone the transformation, and invite them to hang out with you. A conversation over some food is always nice, and can help alleviate some of the awkwardness you may feel as you ask the important questions about your upcoming Change. We recommend asking the following questions (which of course, any adult dragon will be happy to answer in full):

When will my scales burst forth from my flesh and become a beautiful chitinous plating?
When can I start my first hoard?
How long until my cloaca develops?
Will my wings be leathery and supple, or can I choose feathers?
How do I influence the color of my whiskers?
How does self-pleasure work with knife-like talons?

Bring your follow-up questions! Delve deeper into their answers- pursue every implication and detail! You don’t want to go into the Change unprepared! And don’t forget to thank your dragon mentor with the traditional Tenderwing salute!

## No Mistakes, Only Deeper Plans

```
For any number of players, each of whom wants to walk away with the full contents of the Vault. Think to yourself what you'd do with all that money -- debts paid, loved ones saved, mistakes undone.

This game jumps back and forth between two scenes: the planning stage of a heist, and the heist itself.

Planning stage: Players discuss their plan for breaking into the Vault. How to distract guards, steal keys, deactivate cameras. You work together to get in, but remember that only one person can leave with the money. When you feel confident, move to the heist stage.

Heist stage: Players take turns executing the plan, rolling dice to perform anything difficult. Roll 2d6 and sum them -- anything above a 10 grants players a bonus, but anything under a 7 is a failed action. Once an action is failed, jump back to the planning phase -- failing here was all part of the plan. Explain how your failure was all part of the plan, and how you move forward now.

Once a player is in the vault, all bets are off. No more planning stage, just action in the moment. The person who walks out with the money wins.

## One-Night Stand

```
You are two lovers. Think of a name; describe three good qualities you have and two you see in the other. They’ll be tested through play!

Describe yourself.

Describe a place where you can have sex. 

Remember: sex is consensual. Otherwise it’s rape.

Play five scenes: begin describing sex between the lovers. Choose a quality of your character, roll 1d4 and frame a flashback about it; the other player will describe how your quality is...

    1-real: this makes things significantly better;

    2-real: this makes things embarrassing.

    3-not real: this makes things worse;

    4-not real: this improves the situation;


You can cancel a roll and decide the outcome for yourself by burning one quality the other lover has seen in you. They decide which one and describe how they realize their mistake, during sex.

Flashback contents (scene order):

    1: how the lovers met (both roll);


    2-3: Why each lover decided to have a wild night out;


    4-5: Who each character is and what their life looks like.

After last flashback: describe how sex ends. If both lovers still have one of the qualities the other saw in them before, decide what to do next. If not, they will never meet again.

## Route Clearance

```
You are US Army soldiers tasked with clearing the road between Kabul to Kandahar of IEDs during the invasion of Afghanistan. 

Remove all face cards and jokers from a deck of playing cards. Shuffle it.
Place the top twelve cards end to end and face down along the length of the table to represent the road. One end is Kabul and the other is Kandahar.

Each player names and describes their soldier, and narrates a short scene from their basic training, reflecting their motivation for serving.

Each turn a player flips over the next card on the road, starting with Kabul, and narrates a short scene based on the suit:

Clubs: Action or danger

Spades: Emotional difficulty or hardship

Hearts: Humour or comradery

Diamonds: Reflection or contemplation

The higher the number on the card, the more intense the experience.

Scenes can include flashbacks, and, with agreement, other characters. 

An ace of any suit represents a major setback or threat (such as deadly attack or a severe emotional crisis), which the player must describe and narrate. 

After the last card, each player narrates an end scene for their soldier, including whether they come through the experience physically, emotionally or mentally intact.

## Eternal

```
(To be played on a quiet beach.)

You’ve been alive for millennia. You can’t be sure exactly how long, because memories fade along the way. A handful of others like you have found each over the years. Mostly, you keep to yourselves. Every 100 years, you return to this beach, and discuss the tectonic shifts of the human world.

Each player: Collect 5 small stones. Think of important, recent memories for your character—person, place, thing, activity—and assign each to one stone. 

To start: One player observes a defining world crisis. Taking turns adding observations. Any player ends the discussion by saying: “Time will tell.” 

Secretly bid, then simultaneously reveal some (or none) of your stones. The winner proclaims how the crisis will resolve over the next century, for good or ill. In a tie, the winner is whoever spoke last.

If you bid any stones, throw them into the water. These memories are lost.

Separate, and walk the beach alone. Consider how lost memories will affect your character. Consider how their century unfolds. Pick up one new rock—a new memory.

Regroup. A century has passed. Discuss your stories. Then, present a new crisis. Repeat for 400 more years.

## VOICE

```
Silence.

Start with several stones. These are gifts.
Gods gather, with complete control over It. Nothing else.
Gods will give gifts to It.

One of you plays It. Close your eyes, for It cannot see. The Gods have not gifted It SIGHT. But the Gods might. 

The rest are Gods.

A God gives a gift. The first gift must be VOICE or SOUND. Give It a stone.

-VOICE: What does It say? No one will answer It. It is alone. (It may speak; the Gods may not.)
 or
-SOUND: What does It hear? It cannot answer. (The Gods may speak; It may not.)

Give more gifts; explore these gifts. Use logic: if the Gods gift TOUCH, It may feel. What does It feel? A network of sensors? One organic body?

Remember, It describes what It experiences, not the Gods. The Gods only discuss with It (given VOICE + SOUND). Compare themselves to It. The Gods may only explore their world through their gifts to It.

Do the Gods gift It:
-IDENTITY? It becomes Them.
-LOVE? Does It love the Gods?
-SIGHT? What does It see? Monsters? Machines? Mortals?

The Gods can gift It anything.

Play until all gifts are given.

## Stop Reading to Lose

Reading this is playing this.










































Don’t cheat. Go slow.











































You are in cryosleep.











































Why?











































Working?











































In here you don’t age.











































You remember leaving something behind.











































Tingles in your ear.











































You still love them?











































Feel your clothes. Your skin.











































What itches?











































You feel a breeze.











































Imagine home.











































Supposed to be air-tight.











































Feel your arm. Sticky.











































A training video about contaminants.










































 
Who screwed up?











































A growing headache.










































 
You ever seen a worm?










































 
Why are you in debt?


Try not to think about who you are letting down.











































Was the launch terrifying?










































Hum of the engines.










































Your job is to maintain something...










































Thin, piercing pain through your ear, through your head.










































pain










































hurts










































COILED










































You can stop playing, let go.











































Remember when you really got hurt.











































Clench your teeth, squeeze your eyes shut.











































Blurry, unfocused, you’re losing control.











































Do something else, this is just a dumb game.











































Picture who you did wrong to.











































Put yourself in their shoes, asshole.











































Obsess about this regret.











































Compare the two feelings.











































Something crawled in your ear.











































Why don’t you feel worse?











































You’re selfish.











































What’s the point?











































It’s gotta be in your head.











































It’s gonna get worse. 











































You fought off the worm. It dies in your head.
