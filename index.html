"</strong></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why 200 Words?</strong>
A 200 word limit encourages creativity and demands the very best of your editing and writing abilities. While making an rpg in 200 words can be difficult, itâ€™s less of a daunting commitment than editing and proofing 150 pages with art and layout.</p>
  
  
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Plaintext?</strong>
Visual presentation can be a large and scary problem. Very few people are masters of writing, editing, art direction, graphic design, layout, and marketing. It usually takes a village to make a game. We want participants to focus solely on the challenge of creative writing and brutal editing.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Encourage the Community</strong>
Not only does this give experienced designers a chance to flex their muscles, but it encourages new designers to show what they can do. Our biggest hope is that designers will find a submission that resonates with them, reach out to the author, and turn a little blurb into a larger collaborative project. That's why all submissions are protected under the Creative Commons license.</p>
