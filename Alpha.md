## Parasite Vector

```
You are bio-commandos infiltrating the Machine-Monk’s temple to rescue your legion’s War-Womb.

Objectives:
Deny them the war-womb.
Recover the war-womb.
Destroy the temple.

One player’s the Machine-Master, controlling the temple’s defences. Roll on both three times:

Unaugmented
Flesh-and-metal
Mind-slaving
Auto-evolving
Virtual
Mecha

Knights
Hunters
Labyrinths
Engineers
Armouries
Bishops

Baseline humans have no chance. You have certain advantages:

Your Mutations:
4 ganglia: Sever 1 to hypnotise, scry, hack.
Roll [ganglia]d6s to sense environments/coerce others.

4 digits: Sever 1 to fire a burrowing projectile. 
Roll [digits]d6s to use dexterity/precision.

4 blood: Spend 1 to heal mortal wounds/get +1d6.
Roll [blood]d6s to understand/resculpt flesh.

4 limbs: Sever 1 to make an explosive. 
Roll [limbs]d6s to use speed/force.

When rolling take the highest:
6:	Success. Give next commando to roll +1d6.
4-5:	Success. You’re drained/vulnerable.
1-3:	Failure. Reinforcements arrive/you take a mortal wound.
At 0d6 roll 2d6, pick lowest.

Machine-Master: say the Temple’s response, gives another commando a threat or opportunity, and ask what they do.

When you salvage Machine-Monk flesh, restore 1 to a mutation but mark 1:
You can’t hear the squad’s thoughts.
You’ll reject further salvage.
The machinery is beautiful.

## Ex Libro

```
In Ex Libro, players choose characters from novels, trying to find objects or characters held in another book. That other book, the setting, is controlled by the gamemaster.

Preparation: Choose a book ≈300 pages*.

Gamemaster: Read through your chosen book, flagging locations, scenes, characters. Tell the players your book. Create or find any helpful supplements (maps, etc). Choose an object or character from each player’s book to rescue. Identify where in your book these are located.

Players: Read through your chosen book, flagging helpful actions and reactions of your character. Tell the gamemaster your book and character.

Gameplay: The Gamemaster runs characters through the GM’s novel, roleplaying the setting, NPCs, etc. The players roleplay their character. Players choose lines from their novel to resolve conflicts. Once a line is quoted, it cannot be reused, and you cannot choose lines from earlier pages. Characters vanish and return to their novels if they get their quested object, die, or run out of pages. 

*For every 50 pages over, players may not use lines from the first 25. For every 50 pages under, they may at any point jump back 25 pages to choose lines, but they still can’t reuse any lines.

## Human Or Not, Here I Am

```
Future Earth humans and replicants live in peace, but two species are warring with us. One destroys humans, the other non “true-bios”. One of their Inquisitors has captured you for questioning...but you don't know which one.

All players comprise a single Entity, hiding its nature.

Write “human” and “non-human” on paper slips for each player.

Fold and mix slips. Take one, your secret role.

For even numbers, take one extra and set aside.

On new slips, each player writes a personality aspect. Mix slips and take one, your secret aspect.

On final slips, write “humans die”/“non-humans die” (Inquisitor’s agenda). Mix, pick one. Don't look.

Take turns as Inquisitor, asking questions to determine Entity’s humanity.

Ask someone you haven't questioned something that:
...is not directly about role/aspect
...doesn’t repeat another question
...is open-ended

Answer keeping your aspect in mind, hiding your role. Build on answers from other players.

Once everyone has asked everyone else questions, answer the final question together. Is Entity human? Discuss and vote.

Reveal hidden agenda. Did Entity survive?

Reveal roles. Majority determines Entity's humanity. Use the role set aside to break ties.

Was the Inquisitor right? Which side “winning” is winning?
```
<hr> 

## Micro Kittens

```
3-5 players

You are a kitten who wants to get adopted from the Humane Society. Pick a description of why you should be adopted (fluffy, cuddly, playful, tiny, polydactyl) and a description of why you haven’t been adopted yet (dirty, skittish, old, aggressive, sick).

Roll 5d6. Keep them -- this is your pool.

Pick someone to be the active player. When you’re the active player, frame a scene in which you act. Other players portray other characters in the scene.

When you do something ADORABLE in one of the categories below, place a die next to it, as long as it’s different in number from the other dice already there. If you act according to one of your descriptions in this scene, you may re-roll one die from your pool before selecting one to place.

MESSY

ADVENTURE

AFFECTION

MEOWS

The player to your right invents a complication based on your die’s number as follows:

1: Someone gets hurt
2: Someone gets in trouble
3: Something gets lost
4: Something breaks
5: Someone new arrives
6: Something brings bad news

The player to your left now becomes the active player.

When you have done four adorable things, tell who adopted you.

## Duet

```
You need another person, a six-sided die, paper, fifteen tokens, and a pencil.

Write this down.

“I remember when...
We first met
I made a mistake
I thought I lost them
I told the truth
I forgave them
It ended”

Your true love was taken into Darkness. They are the Lost. They take five tokens.
They call to you, the Seeker. Take ten tokens.


When you go into Darkness, you remember. Roll the die, then say

“I felt…”
1. Crushed
2. Depressed
3. Infuriated
4. Peaceful
5. Inspired
6. Loved

Say where it started, then ask how. They answer, then ask you a question. Choose.

"I remember." Place a token, then answer. Ask them a question, they have the same choice.

"I don't remember." Take all tokens placed, erase the memory, and the Seeker goes into Darkness.

You only remember what isn't erased.

The game ends when either all memories are erased, or someone has no tokens

Don't continue reading until your game ends...

If the Seeker or the Lost have more tokens than the other, only they find their way out of Darkness.

If the Seeker and the Lost have the same number of tokens, they find each other.

## What The #@*$ Happened Last Night?

```
A modern urban storytelling game for 3 to 6 players.

* Choose a group bond: College buddies? Coworkers? Extended family?

* Agree on tone: Surreal? Gritty? Wacky? This matters!

* Everyone wakes up in a daze after a crazy night out.

* “Where are we?” Jail cell? Hotel suite? Stranger’s house? 

* Each player gets 10 poker chips representing memory blocks. 

* The player who vomited most recently starts.

"WHAT THE #@*$ HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?"

* Take turns piecing together your experiences. Figure out the sequence of events, in reverse chronological order.

~ "Last thing I remember we..."
~ "Oh! And before that we..."

* Every scenario should be 2 or 3 sentences featuring a particular event, person, location, or thing.

* Each scenario removes one memory block.

* A player's turn ends when…

~ They lag 5 seconds between scenarios.
~ Their scenario is too far-fetched for the current narrative - others call bullshit!

* That player adds one memory block and the next player takes over.

* The game ends when a player loses all their memory blocks - they remember how the night actually began!

* Optional: "Who's calling?" When a player first reaches 5 memory blocks, someone calls their mobile phone. Roll 1d6.

6 - Pimp
5 - Priest
4 - Dealer
3 - Stripper
2 - Officer
1 - Gangster

## Don’t lose your marbles

```
You need a jar full of marbles and a couple of friends to play this game. Choose one person to be the narrator of the first scene. This role is rotated across the table. Each person should be the narrator for one scene, and then pass the torch to another player.

Discuss the type of story you want to tell together. Each player creates a character and tells their story to the others. The other players add one detail each to the character’s story and associate to that detail a number of marbles that character will starts with.

Whenever something disturbing happens to your character, the narrator gives you one or more marbles. You have to hold your marbles with a single hand (or on a small cup). When you cannot hold more marbles, your character goes insane. Tell to the other players how the current event drove you to madness.

Suggestions for the number of marbles one should get when:

Seeing a dead body: 1 - 3 marbles, depending on how well you know the person
Watching a murder happen: 3 - 5 marbles, ditto
Learning about unspeakable things: 3 - 10 marbles
Seeing or doing an unspeakable thing: 5 - 15 marbles
```
<hr> 

## [REDACTED]

```
[REDACTED] is a Cold War espionage game. 

Each player has a dossier, initially with one page of a memo or a personnel file about their agent. 

To take an action, roll 1d6: 
Five or less and Control says what happened. 
Six, seven, or eight and the player says what happened, but Control may add a twist.
Nine or more and the player says what happened.

You can add dice by redacting words from your dossier. Redacting one phrase that applies to your current situation grants you an additional d6. Unrelated words grant you +1 per word.

Example: A sentence reads "Seth Taylor, 5' 3", was arrested on June 14, 1985, breaking into Masters Electronics on Fry Street." If there is a part of the game where it is beneficial to be small, redact the height, and now roll 2d6. Infiltrating a building? redact "breaking into" and "Fry Street" to roll three dice. Knock out a guard? Redact "1985" to gain +1 on the roll.

After the mission, write up a new sheet for your dossier. You can redact from the new sheet normally, but older sheets need one additional word redacted for each page further back in the dossier.﻿

## Cat Wrangling

```
Cat Wranglers earn experience gathering cats into their herd.

Start with 2d6 cats and one method. Each turn there will be 1d6 new cats in your neighborhood, and 2d6 cats attempting to escape.

Both ancient methods and new methods are used.

Ancient methods include fresh fish, canned fish, caged canaries, and catnip. Cats may be strays, or those stuck in trees. Each method attracts 1d6 cats.

New methods must be researched to maximize one's herd. Possible new methods are: cat yodeling, cat calling, breeding Andalusian catherd dogs, etc.

Developing new methods are adjudicated by the judge with a difficulty level. Any creative and entertaining method is permitted.

Enticements for cats to leave the herd must be negated. Threats include: big mama cat or old Tom on the prowl and frisky, mice on the periphery of the herd, song birds in the forest too near the ground, children with a laser pointer, stray dogs running wild, etc.

The health of your heard must be maintained by cleaning the litter boxes and feeding the herd.

Tick marks keep track of cats, food, and litter. Starting methods on index cards are assigned randomly.

Each dozen cats attracts a helper and gains a level.

## The Places Where I Found You

```
Tools: Pencil and paper. 

Roles: The House (mute). The Ghost. The Child. The Diary. 

Players: 4. Combine The Child and Diary roles to play with 3, and The House and Ghost to play with 2. 

1. In silence, The House begins drawing a location - such as a house, room, or outdoor setting - on a piece of paper. The Ghost interprets the image and answers questions from The Child and Diary about the location while The House draws.

2. The Diary narrates an average day from The Child's past set in the sketched location. The House illustrates the setting with features from The Diary's story, until the The Ghost interrupts. 

3. The Ghost creates a Haunted Object, which The House draws, and recounts The Child's monstrous or unsettling encounter with the object.

4. The Child responds with a positive memory or fantasy about the location or Haunted Object, and crumples up the page. 

Repeat Steps 1 through 4 two more times.  

5. The Ghost chooses one of the crumpled pages at random. They reveal The Ghost's origin or first manifestation in that location.

6. The Child takes another crumpled page and describes their final encounter with The Ghost in that location.

## Backpackers

```
Backpackers:
    Modern day adventure-travellers meet, share stories, and hookup.

You all come from a different place. (Make a passport.)
You’ve all arrived at the same destination. (Stamp your passport.)
You’ve shared an interesting, new experience. 
    (scuba, surfing, climbing, riding, archaeology, festival, whatever)
Now, you’re at the afterparty...

Together, in conversation, describe your experiences.
    “I loved it when…”
    “That was so funny when…”
    “Did you see the … ?”

Don’t take orderly turns. Instead, jump in anytime and riff. 
    Say “OMG YES! And then...!”.

You’re getting to know each other. Ask questions. Who are they, where do they come from, what’s it like there, how did they afford the trip, how do they feel about important issues, etc?

At any point, you may offer to “hookup” with someone. Invite them to join you on your next trip to (where?).

If they agree, the conversation moves to the next afterparty in the new destination. Stamp your passports. Other players may bring their current characters or create new ones.


Why play Backpackers? 

    It’s fun travelling, meeting new people, sharing experiences, and collecting passport stamps.
    It may be interesting to explore notions of privilege, entitlement, cultural stereotypes, infatuation, jealousy, etc.

## Tiny Tribe

```
The players are leaders of a 100 tiny person tribe trying to survive in a suburban home. They may be fragile and an inch tall, but each one is absolutely devoted to their leaders.

Pregame
GM / leaders decide on goals like “Drink Milk” or “Make Fire” that the leaders must guide their tribe to complete.

Conflict Resolution (CR)
1. GM chooses dice based on difficulty and risk
2. Leaders assign a number of tribesman to the job
  a. Moving tribesmen over gaps or vertically necessitates assigning as many tribesmen as the leaders want to move, moving more tribesmen may be more risky
3. The number rolled is the number of assigned tribesmen who died in service
4. At least one tribesman must survive for success
5. If the lowest possible number is rolled everyone survives

After CR1 a leader can choose to complete the task themselves. This guarantees success but will always kill the leader, who must now lead from beyond the grave as a ghost!

Objects can be carried. After CR1 the leaders may describe how to use an object to complete a task. The GM gives a number between zero and infinity to be subtracted from the roll.
```
<hr> 

## Wilder

```
Three to four people outline a wilderness setting (mountaintop, desert, ...); name the recurring Challenge against your return home (wildlife, weather, ...). Everyone says who they’re portraying and chooses +1 to act rashly, help others, or use wits. One player narrates the scene of how your characters became stranded in this wilderness.

Write down three obstacles (trapped, starvation, ...) against which the characters work to return to civilisation; set them out on the table. In a hat, everyone places three Tickets with narrative elements (cabin, gunfire, ...) written on them. Keep the challenge in mind.

Choose one player to be the Guide, who picks an obstacle and draws a ticket, narrating scenes to include them. Other players say what their characters do; some draw tickets to use in their descriptions.

When players try something risky or dangerous, roll a dice. 4+ is good, 3- isn’t; the guide says how.

After three tickets are used, if the obstacle hasn’t been overcome, the guide narrates it’s resolution, good or bad.

After an obstacle is resolved another player volunteers to be the new guide and picks a new obstacle. For the last obstacle, the guides says how overcoming it takes you home.

## Lovecraft Lightest

```
Character Creation: Roll 4d4 for stat points and distribute them between BODY and MIND to a minimum of 2 and maximum of 8. These are all the stats characters have. Players have 4 item slots and 1 weapon slot and can add anything to those slots with GM’s discretion during character creation. Ammunition needed for a weapon uses an item slot. 

How to play: When a player wishes to take an action that player rolls a d12 against a stat the GM calls for. On a result less than the character's stat is rolled, the attempt is a success. On a result equal or greater than the stat, an additional point is added to the stat. Once either stat reaches 11 points, the character dies.

Sanity: When a character sees something their mind may not comprehend, a GM may call for a sanity check where a player rolls 1d10 and must roll higher than their MIND stat or add 1 point to that stat.

Damage:When a character takes damage, a GM may call for a Damage check where a player rolls 1d10 and must roll higher than their BODY stat or add 1 point to that stat.

## Modern Olympus

```
A Two-Player Game

Premise:
          The ancient Olympians have survived to this day, but time has mangled their portfolios.  They remember what they were; most hate what they are.  With enough divine energy, they can reclaim their original godhead.

Characters:
                                    Ancient                       Modern
Zeus                            Lightning                     Lighting
Hera                            Womanhood               Punishment

Athena                         Wisdom                       Hair
Apollo                          Truth                            Fraternities

Goal: 
          Find other Olympians. Absorb their divinity through pleading, coercion, deception, or violence.

Rules:
- Player can always sense the direction (but not identity) of the nearest Olympian.
- Olympians cannot die or fade away before losing their divinity. “Killed” Olympians revive unscathed within one hour.
- Divinity cannot be absorbed from unwilling Olympians unless they’re unconscious. 
- Absorbing an Olympian’s divinity adds its portfolios to player’s own. 
- Resolve magical challenges by rolling 1d6 for ancient portfolios or 2d6 for modern portfolios.
- Resolve mundane physical, mental and social challenges by rolling 1d6.  Add +1 per applicable - ancient portfolio; add +2 per applicable modern portfolio.
- Rolls succeed on results ≥ 5.
- If portfolio(s) were applied to mundane rolls, player narrates success / failure. Otherwise, GM narrates success / failure.

## Space travel with babies

```
Up to five adults and babies.

Space is big: hundreds of colonised worlds. Technology, culture and law vary.

FTL travel uses 'jump pods’, traveling between gates. Journeys take 1-5 hours, connecting with many worlds and gates at each end.

**Play**
The game is one jump journey. Agree how long the journey will be, set a timer; when it goes off, the journey ends.

The room you are in, plus bathroom and kitchen, is your jump pod. 

Children play themselves; actions relating to them are in character. 

Play begins when you enter the pod as strangers, stuck in this space with children; your only entertainment is talking. Start with small talk, but progress to learning about each other.

**Character generation**
* Where are you travelling from/to?
* Why? 
* Did anyone see you off?
* Is anyone meeting you?
* One-way or return trip? 
* Have you been there before? 

**Tips**
* Look for similarities and differences between you.
* Make things up about your journey, destination, family as you go along 
* Talk about the children: ages, activities, preferences, abilities. 
* Think about how children learn social rules, and have leeway in breaking them; what are they doing which will be trained out of them later?

## Oathbreakers: Deviant Warlocks

```
Gather three tokens per person.

Each person states a long-standing norm. When the last person finishes, they also declare how their Oathbreaker broke a stated norm. Then they decide their name and one or two powers. Each person follow suit, then a candle is lit.

During the following scenes, an Oathbreaker may use an owned power. If used to benefit another Oathbreaker, the player gives a token to that favored player. If used to benefit a non-deviant, the player removes the token from play. If used to benefit themselves, the player keeps the token. If you have no tokens but use a power, take another's, then cast it away forever.

First, play to answer: In what ways is our deviant enclave home, even when other deviants threaten it? Once answered, someone extinguishes the candle.

After time, another candle is lit. Next, play to answer: Why does greater society and its oaths still challenge our lives on the periphery? Once answered, someone extinguishes the candle.

After some time, a final candle is lit. Lastly, play to answer: How do we tangle our lives with non-deviants? Once answered, someone extinguishes the final candle.

Examine how the remaining tokens spell each Oathbreaker’s fate.

## Go North

```
GO NORTH
An improv RPG in the style of classic text adventures

ROLES
- 1 GM
- Players, usually just 1 main player, who control a single character

RULES
Players alternate with the GM stating an action, and the GM stating a result. Actions must be kept simple– a single verb and object, possible with simple clarification For example, “Go North,” “Check Inventory,” “Place key in lock.” The GM will then respond with the result of that action in a few sentences. Everything else is completely up to the discretion and imagination of the GM– the game is completely freeform and improvisational, including where the adventure takes place, starting inventory, etc. In general the GM only thinks a few steps ahead, giving the result of individual player actions; there’s no larger plot or story.

If playing with multiple players, they share control of a single character.

While players are free to try anything they want, typical verbs include “go <direction>”, “examine <object>”, “check inventory,” “use <object>,” “look at <anything>,” and so on.

Traditionally, the player’s first action is always “Go North”

## No set.

```
Meditate on this moment.

Then gather four of your dearest friends. 
Hand them each pens, papers, three envelopes. 
Ask them each to imagine a character. A Persona.  
There are no limits or set setting. Anything they fancy beautiful, interesting or worth exploring will do just fine.
Ask them to describe the race of their characters. Its appearance, traditions, and the history of its ancestors. They are to describe it all in paper, and save each paper in a different envelope. 
The second envelope is for the profession, skills and possessions of their characters. 
The last envelope is for the personalities, tastes, mannerisms, fears, weaknesses.
Remind them that each of the descriptions should be beautiful in itself and self-sufficient. And that if one of the three facets needs the others to exist, they probably don’t have a very interesting character.  Remind them that they themselves are not their nationality, jobs or moods.

Before starting to play, shuffle and deal the envelopes. 
Each player will now have a character made with the ideas of their friends, none of the ideas of their own. Ask them to roleplay earnestly. 

The mechanics and dice-throwing are left for you to decide, as they are secondary.

## Reign over Hell

```
You are Devils, Squabbling over Hell.

Choose some adversaries, 3 candles each, and writing implements.

Declare a True Name, your twisted Form and the three Greatest Playthings under your Dominion. Each lights 3 Candles to represent these.

Form a Circle. Inscribe a Glyph by marking a Line connecting each Devil. Starting with the Greatest among you and cycling leftwards, a Devil names another Devil. They both write either Contempt or Wrath on a scrap of paper, then reveal what was written.

If One declares Wrath, they take a Plaything from the other, who states how.

If both declare Wrath, Each Devil loses a Plaything. They both describe how they destroyed the other's Playthings.

If both have written Contempt, each restores a lost Domain.

If none declare Wrath in a full rotation of the Circle, the conflict subsides, and the Devil with the most Playthings reigns Supreme.

If a Devil ever has more than Five Playthings, one Rebels and is destroyed. Describe why.

If a Devil has no Playthings, his last Hope is begging the Heavens for forgiveness before being torn asunder by lost souls. Either Pray for Salvation, or Spite Him one last time. He will Accept, either way.

## The Victory Circle; A Nano-Larp

```
Stand in a corner and say: “Rhode Island. July, 1676. We’re English farmers who have been at war with the Wampanoag Sachem Metacom. Some have lost everything. With our native allies the Mohegan, we’ve captured 40 of Metacom’s warriors. The Mohegan are uneasy. They desire a captive. We are reluctant to disoblige our allies.” 
Decide together: Give them a man who boasted of killing nineteen Englishmen [go to 1] or refuse [go to 3].

[1] Say: “They form a jubilant circle and hack off the warrior’s toes”. 
Stop the torture [3] or step forward and be complicit [4].

[2] Say: “The Mohegan invite us to bash in his skull to revenge ourselves.”
Swing your clubs [5] or decline [7].

[3] Say: “The Mohegan furiously break their alliance and join Metacom’s confederacy. We’ve doomed the New England colonies.”
END

[4] Say: “The Mohegan make him dance and then sever his fingers.” 
Stop them [3] or join the circle [6].

[5] Say: “We beat the captive to death.”
END

[6] Say: “They break his legs and prepare to kill him. He remains expressionless.”
Take up clubs yourselves [2] or stop this [3].

[7] Say: “They beat the captive to death.”

## Cops

```
You are a police officer who work on the streets. You fight the crime: violence, burglary, murder, drugs, etc. You always work with a partner(another player). If there an even number of players, than one player is working undercover.
One player is the Crimelord, which is going to throw shit at the characters’ lives. Under charged situations they can ask for a roll to see if players succeed. Players start with 3d6, and need 4 or higher on 2 dice. If players fail, they can turn it into a success by adding stress dice (3 minus total of success; use a different colour dice). When partners work together, both receive an extra dice.
Success granted by stress dice or when players add them allow the Crimelord to create a complication. The more stress dice, the tougher is the complication.
Each player has one trait. They need to choose one word that describe something their character is good at. When the trait applies they have an extra die.
Remove 1 stress dice at the begging of each session and when players do something to relax. The Crimelord can remove a stress dice to throw a complication anytime.

## Five Cards

```
Referee designs adventure. Challenges defined in terms of the number of success needed to overcome them.

Players get 10 cards. 5 Action Cards:

Success with complication
Complete success
Failure with benefit
Complete failure
Standoff

And 5 blank Character Cards. They define their Character by writing 5 things on them. 

Referee gets 5 cards:

Referee claims card
Player retains card
Card goes to another Player
Card discarded
Player vote

Referee describes the setting. Players state actions. When Characters face a challenge, player draws random Action Card. Results interpreted by Referee. Failure may cause wound - turn a Character Card over. Successes/benefits may heal wounds.

Referee draws a random Referee Card to determine what happens to the player's Action Card. The Referee can take no proactive actions until they have gained at least one action card. They then have two piles of cards.

Player and the Referee shuffle their card piles. Action moves to next Player.

If a Player has no Action Cards and their Character has a wound, they are dead. 

Play continues until the adventure is over or all Action Cards are discarded.

## Unknown Kingdoms: The Footsteps of Marco Polo

```
Renowned traveller Marco Polo has disappeared. Hearing legends of lands he visited, a band of curious Venetians sets out to document these strange kingdoms, befriend their rulers in the name of Venice, and perhaps find the lost explorer.
 
2d6
Deck of cards spread face down in a grid to form the landscape.
 
Red cards: wilderness. Mountains, deserts, seas...
Clubs: cities.
Spades: special settlements. Monasteries, pirate hideouts, ancient ruins…
Jokers: mysteries. Ghost-towns, tombs, hidden temples…
 
Face-cards follow their suit and indicate a remarkable person present – mighty king, reclusive sage, legendary thief, infamous villain…
 
The first player selects a card from one of the grid’s edges to reveal. They get to describe the place and any distinctive features (culture, diplomatic relations…).
 
Actions:
Reveal and describe a card adjacent to any upturned card.
‘Interact’ with an upturned card (discover clues, befriend populace, buy boat…): declare intention and roll 2d6. If the result equals/betters the card’s number, you succeed. Relevant interactions from earlier in the game give +2 bonuses (necessary for king-cards). For failures, another player describes what happens. For face-cards, another player describes the NPC’s reaction (strike bargain, ask for a favour…).
 
Take turns to act. Explore these strange lands together.

You’re called The Suits. It’s not a matter of way you’re dressed, but of your skills. You’re thieves, burglars, cons. You’re Magicians. And you’re expensive. But only for being the best. And now, you have a mission.

The suits is an RPG about magician thieves. The world is the same as ours, and they are not actually using magic, but skills of hands and minds. They are called The suits, because they use playing cards as their call sign, and they are recognised by the suit of the card, which represents their speciality - Hearts - the negotiators, Clubs - the muscles, Spades -  people with fast hands and Diamonds - safe, and any lock crackers. The game is played with a deck of cards, each player (including GM) drawing 5 cards. 2 is the lowest number, King and Ace are the highest. Every action players do They draw from the top of the deck trying to hit a number. They can then use a trick - add card from their hand to help themselves, or friendly player, redrawing after.

## Girls from Gilmore, Boys from the Dwarf

```
Inspired by tv shows such as Gilmore Girls and Red Dwarf, this game supports linked-session play focused on enduring yet difficult relationships.
Setup
Agree a setting with several characters who cannot abandon one another (isolation, strong family ties, blood oaths, business contracts, dependencies etc).
Brainstorm a number of disagreements that could permanently damage their relationships ('wedges').
For each relationship between two characters, agree one wedge that occurred in the past that was never fully resolved (their 'backstory'). Backstories can be referenced in play, but are never the primary focus.
Play
To begin play, select one relationship (and only one) and agree a wedge that will impact it.
Each wedge is explored in 3 scenes that must include the two characters.
1 Introduction
2 Escalation
3 Ultimatum
In between these scenes must be one or more side-scenes with one of the impacted characters but not the other.
After the Ultimatum scene, the impacted players agree whether their characters will fully reconcile or not. If so, remove the wedge. If not, add it to their backstory. Backstories are never removed.
Continue play by selecting a different relationship and agreeing a wedge, then following the same process.
Brainstorm new wedges when needed.

## Thank you for the feast

```
Sit down for dinner with your close friends. You are very important people at a fancy dinner. Before you begin eating, name yourself, your title and what you’ve done to further your political career. Explain your connection to two other guests and build the story of your careers together. Each dinner guest receives two poison tokens which they keep under their napkin. Every guest closes their eyes in turn and players secretly place tokens in front of their plates. Guests can be poisoned multiple times. Not all tokens must be used.

Have your meal and enjoy the time spent with your friends.

At the end of the meal, take turns to accuse your fellow guests of poisoning you with your dying breath. You have one guess per token. If you’re correct, the guest will say “and I did it all because…” and explain their motive. You survive that poisoning attempt and move on to the next token.

If you’re dying of poison you must still answer accusations. 

At the end of the meal, if you’re alive rise from the table, thank your guests and clear the table. You look forward to the next dinner party with your dearest friends.

## Nakama: A Card Game of Magical Girls

```
Five players, two decks of cards (no jokers.)

Four players are a magical girl team; Princess Heart/Diamond/Club/Spade.  Divvy each suit to their respective player.

You are The Adversary. You get a full deck of your own.

The Princesses interact with each other in their lives, then the monster of the week attacks! Everyone shuffles their decks.

The Adversary draws one card for the monster’s Strength and unique power; Princesses must meet or exceed this to score a hit. Each Princess describes what they are doing and draws a card from their deck. Each Princess must score one hit before the monster is weakened; one more hit defeats it.

The Monster draws a second card; the suit is an attack on that Princess! She draws a card to defend herself (losing two cards if unsuccessful.) A Princess is down if she is out of cards.

Princesses recover all lost cards when a monster is defeated.

The Princesses win by defeating 13 monsters.

MONSTERS
Hearts: Recovers one hit each round.
Diamonds: Requires two Princesses to score one hit for it to count.
Clubs: Can force a Princess to discard one extra card.
Spades: Can attack two Princesses. (Resolve separately.)

## Factossimations
a story rpg system

```
SYNOPSIS~

Players operate FACTS, POSSIBILITIES, and TRANSFORMATIONS.

PREPARATION~  
    
Breathe.   
    
Each player establishes:
    
1 fact about each: setting; setting history; and own character history;

3 facts about own character;
   
1 possibility about each: setting; setting history; story; story history; and another player's character.
  
GAME~

Each player receives 1 Transformation, 1 Possibility, and 3 Facts to use Per Scene. Establish these in-scene or as logical, changing existing or creating new  elements.
 
[Play character-affecting facts only on own character, unless whole group agrees otherwise.]

FACTS are true at creation.
    
Facts change possibilities into Facts, and Facts into Hard Facts.
    
HARD FACTS are difficult to change.
  
POSSIBILITIES remain uncertain until changed into Facts.
Possibilities change Facts into Transformations.
  
TRANSFORMATIONS remain active until changed into Facts.
    
Transformations change Facts into (new) Facts.
    
2 Transformations + 1 Possibility can amalgamate 2 Hard Facts into 1 (new) Hard Fact.

## Purgatory House

```
You and your friends have stumbled on an old, creepy, and seemingly endless mansion. The House is evil and doesn’t want you to leave, though. New horrors lurk behind every door. Darkness strives to devour you.

One player plays as the House and tries to stop the others from leaving. Everyone else plays as themselves with the abilities and hindrances they actually possess. 

The last player alive is the only one who can escape the House.

The House describes the scene and the other players take turns narrating their actions. A hand of Blackjack is played against the House to resolve combat, or anytime a risk is taken. If the player wins then they succeed in their current task. If they lose, they fail. If they bust (more than 21) then they take serious damage. Once a player busts three times they are devoured.

The last player standing continues to narrate their attempts to flee. Once they win three more hands they have managed to escape the grounds and win the game! However, if they bust three times in total then they too have perished.

The House goes dormant. It waits. New victims will arrive... They always do.

## My Imaginary Friend

```
A game for three.

The Child wants to have fun, rebel, be noticed by adults. They describe their Friend and give them a name.

The Friend wants to be loved always by the Child, for only the Child truly sees them. Everyone else sees the Friend as an inanimate object, or doesn’t see them at all.

The World plays “everyone else”. They want to nurture the child, discipline them, and see them grow into a splendid adult.

Each player creates scenes as they come up with good ideas – take turns, share authority.

During each scene, the Child describes their actions and the World responds. The Friend also describes their actions, but only the Child may respond.

To resolve a challenge: the Child says what they want to happen. The others may agree or offer another outcome.

If all three players agree, that’s what happens. Otherwise, each rolls a die, highest roll gets to say what happens. On a tie, something else unexpected happens - the first person to call dibs gets to say what – but must do so immediately. Don’t call dibs and then dither!

Play until the Child outgrows their Friend, or until bedtime.

## Cross The Kitchen

```
Players each need a hero toy - action figures, superhero squinkies, or Lego minifgs work best. Also needed are a d6, d12 and tape measure.  The toy must make it across the room, stopping at each agreed upon checkpoint. 

Each round, players roll the d6, moving the hero up to that many feet toward the next checkpoint; and the d12 to check for hazards and boons. If the d12 comes up odd, the player has encountered a hazard. The opposing player(s) determine the nature and effect of the hazard. On an even roll, the player encounters a boon, and decides herself the effect of the powerup. Hazards and boons affect the hero’s speed, abilities, or the environment. The higher the roll, the more significant the effect (1 is the smallest possible hazard, 2 the smallest possible boon, etc).

Players use their characters’ powers to cross the room - flight, swinging on webs, leaping. The floor, of course, is magic phantom zone annihilation lava, so they will have to find a way across using furniture and objects. Touching the floor sends the toy back to the most recent checkpoint.

The winner is the first to reach the room’s final checkpoint.

## To Sea In A Sieve!

```
The players are the Jumblies, setting off to have adventures beyond the sea. In a sieve, naturally.

Each Jumbly has three skills: culineering (for creating food, machinery, or food-related machinery), seachanting (for singing, interpersonal & trading rolls), and unwibble (a jumbly with more unwibble is taller and braver). At game start they get 21 points to share between these as they wish. They must roll equal to or under their skill on 2d6 to pass a roll, taking into account any modifiers from the difficulty, equipment, etc.

Players may take 5 skills OR common household items of any sort the GM allows them and are of a tech level no later than ca 1800, excepting sporks, which are forbidden except to priests of the Jumbly deity Timballo. Priests of Timballo may *only* carry sporks as tools, but get a free starting block of stilton (effects unknown).

Note that Jumblies have no ability in combat at all but are able to set traps, talk, and run away quite effectively. Terrors might include giant silver-bees, the sea, or the Torrible Zone. Player goals may include purchasing certain items, exploring locations, finding new homelands, or simply eating as much cheese as possible.

## Denominator

```
Numbers.

LIFE is all numbers/figures to you, the Domicile’s three ONE PERCENTERS.

Life oppresses you with endless suggestions (therapy, “eye contact,” “take Haloperidol”).   

Question Life.  Parley with Life.

Sometimes, Life pompously doubts your existential narrative: “Could you really incapacitate 10 White Coats with your bare hands?”  

When this occurs, grab a bucket of diversely-sized dice.  Each of you pick one dice from the bucket and roll it.  Life picks first.  The highest roller settles the matter (reroll ties).  Life reveals something immutable about “Reality” (pfft) whenever it rolls highest (“You aren’t Batman.”)  Ignore anything said about numbers.

After rolling, claim your dice.  Its number is now yours (is it: [vengeful], [compassionate], [destructive], [flippant], [wary], or [perverted]?)  In the future, Claim all dice showing this number, and whenever this number is the highest roll, you, not the roller, narrate what happens (minding your number’s personality).  Life never claims dice.

When Life spits its figures at you (“She’s ‘16’ years old!”), you may shove one or more of your number friends into Life’s lying mouth to overwrite them (‘16’ can become ‘18’—or ‘187’—very quickly).  This changes Life, and returns dice used to the bucket.  

End when Life ceases doubting.

## Masters of the universe

```
You are all investment bankers. You each start with 3 coins, and you choose one of those coins and place it under your hand, with either heads or tails showing.

One person starts as the lead banker and tosses a coin. When it lands, everyone reveals their hands. Anyone who guessed correctly keeps their coin. Anyone who guessed incorrectly has to pass their coin on to the next person to their right who guessed correctly. 

The person with most coins at this point is the new lead banker. Everyone takes a turn to praise the lead banker for their skill and cleverness. The person who is most effusive, clever or funny must be rewarded with one of the lead bankers coins.

The process is then repeated until only one player has all the coins.

Anyone who loses all their coins in a round is out of the game and narrates the story of their downfall.

The last player with all the coins is declared the Master of the Universe.

## Our Ancestor’s Secret Wars

```
Underlying system: the Pool System by James V. West.

Get all the Aces through fours from a deck of cards and shuffle them up.  Deal two cards to each player.  One card will establish the player’s function and ancestry.  The other will be a family and technology they struggle with: Player’s choice between the two cards.  Or choose preference for both settings.  These are the only elements that do not change from game to game.

A - Pilot - Describes places / journey
2 - Engineer - Makes / provides vehicles / weapons / equipment
3 - Patreon - In charge of the missions, what is found, and the goal
4 - Hired Help - Useful for identifying enemies and creatures

Hearts - Verne’s & Moorcock’s - Steampunk
Clubs - Newton’s & DaVinci’s - Physicists
Diamond - Tesla’s & Edison’s - Electricity
Spades - Lovecraft’s & Crowley’s - Mysticism

It’s present day, and you are the hidden descendents of some prominent figures from the past.  You’ve been training in the technologies and methods that your ancestors developed in order to take on immortal enemies and eternal organizations.  While you may find some of the other families have ways discordant with your own, you will all have to work together in order to succeed.

## All For One, the flipped RPG

```
One player plays the hero. The rest are storytellers, who distribute these roles between themselves:
Architect: Sets the scene when the hero arrives somewhere. Moderates movement in the space.
Historian: Responsible for backstories, items and oddities. Adds details to the broad strokes of the Architect.
Foil: Roleplays the major NPC in each scene. Assigns minor NPCs to other storytellers, giving them: Personality or mood, Desire (what they want), and Conflict (what or who they’re struggling with).
Judge: Rules on challenges and conflicts (use any game system, or none). Assigns responsibilities to other storytellers as needed.
Director: Keeps an eye on plot and momentum. Introduces events or changes locations if things stagnate.
 
Before play, the hero player takes ONE MINUTE to describe their hero, then leaves the room. The storytellers sketch out the plot, led by the Director, spending ONE MINUTE on each of:
>Where is the hero? Why? What occurrence will draw them into the story?
>What obstacles will the hero face? Who or what will aid them? How will the story change them?
>How does the story end? How does this reflect the changes within the hero? How does it resolve the occurrence that began the story?
 
Play begins!

## Dragon Soul

```
Chaos threatens the Middle Lands. The Pale King raises necrotic armies. Insectoid demons of the Million Hells infect reality. The mechanical warriors of the Ochre Horde are at the gates. You have the Dragon Soul - the power of a god! Will you rise to the challenge and become a hero?

As player, fill the [trait] in the sentence below:

I am [name], who [power] and wields [weapon]; my burden is [burden].

Your Soul starts at 1; for every [trait] that wow’s the other players, raise your Soul by 1, maximum 5. Think about [traits] that are larger than life.

In a Conflict, describe your intentions; be cinematic, gravity-defying, god-like; if you wow the other players, raise your Soul by 1 for this Conflict. Grab 1d6 for every [trait] that applies, roll under Soul to succeed; if you fail, Soul drops by 1 - if your [burden] applied, decide on something bad. Against Minions, every success defeats one; against Rivals, every success lowers their Soul by 1. You become Mortal if your Soul reaches 0.

As GM, scene-frame aggressively, create engaging Antagonists that threaten the world and reality itself, and interesting locations for fight scenes; create situations that target the character’s [burden].

## European

```
Distribute four blank index cards, markers, and a random role to each player; roles remain secret.

Roles are:

HANDOFF
HITMAN
BUYER
DEALER
UNDERCOVER
DINER

Each player may go to the bathroom four times, and can be in the bathroom for up to thirty seconds at a time. When going to the bathroom, they first write down what they will do in the bathroom. (Ex. Hide knife, look for money, pee) If the player is leaving/taking something from the bathroom, they must leave/take that card. A player cannot use a card that has already been written on.

HANDOFF needs to get the murder weapon to HITMAN, who needs to kill DEALER (and no one else) to win.

DEALER needs to get the package to BUYER, and BUYER needs to get the money to DEALER (without being caught) to win.

UNDERCOVER wins by using their one accusation to correctly identify a pair of criminals. (HANDOFF/HITMAN, BUYER/DEALER)

DINER has an overactive bladder- they can only use their cards to pee, and must use them all by game’s end.

If you die, you lose. Multiple players can win.

Game ends with a murder, successful accusation, or all cards used.

## Catalyst of Annihilation

```
Two acquaintances stumble into each other through pure coincidence. The world is doomed because of this chance encounter.

Describe who the characters are and how they know each other. Discuss tone and setting (mythic, mundane, supernatural, military, sci-fi, etc).  

One starts as the Asker. The other starts as the Answerer. 

ASKING
Asker, ask a leading or prying question starting with Who, What, Where, When, Why, or How.  

RESPONDING
Answerer, pick a response from the list below and flesh out the past, present or future as directed. Then, start a new round as the Asker.  

Refuse
Refuse to answer the question. It reminds you of a past failure. Flashback to a past frustration that brought you here. 

Obfuscate
Lie or stall. Something in the present is more pressing. Describe a change in the immediate scene.

Answer 
Describe a scene at the end of the world. Include the corresponding prompt’s detail from the table below. Then, answer the question in the present. Cross off the question’s prompt. 

Prompt...      Detail
Who...         Concluding regret.  
What...        Desecrated touchstone.   
Where...       Profane bodies. 
When...        Devoured hope.
Why...         Gnawing void.
How...         Cataclysmic instrument.

ENDING
The game ends when all prompts are spent and the world’s fate is sealed.

## Too Much Bubblegum: More than you can chew!

```
Aliens are amongst us and it's time to fight back! ...But this bubblegum won't chew itself.

Every player adds a handful of d6s (bubblegum) to a pile on the table. Shuffle two jokers into a 52-card deck.

Each round, players take however much bubblegum they want from the pile (minimum one).

Count the remaining bubblegum. Each player takes turns drawing a card face-up until one card has been drawn for each bubblegum left in the pile.

If you draw a joker, roll the dice you took. If any die comes up 1, you're abducted! Shuffle everyone's cards back into the deck before you go, and come back next round as an infiltrator.

At the end of the round, shuffle the deck and discard all the dice you took: you chewed that bubblegum or died trying!

Once per game you can swallow your gum: re-roll all 1s. (Don’t eat the dice.)

If an infiltrator draws a joker, they pick a human to roll instead.

If you run out of humans, the aliens win.

If you start a round with no pile left, you've chewed all the bubblegum and the remaining humans can start fighting the aliens!

## No Mistakes, Only Deeper Plans

```
For any number of players, each of whom wants to walk away with the full contents of the Vault. Think to yourself what you'd do with all that money -- debts paid, loved ones saved, mistakes undone.

This game jumps back and forth between two scenes: the planning stage of a heist, and the heist itself.

Planning stage: Players discuss their plan for breaking into the Vault. How to distract guards, steal keys, deactivate cameras. You work together to get in, but remember that only one person can leave with the money. When you feel confident, move to the heist stage.

Heist stage: Players take turns executing the plan, rolling dice to perform anything difficult. Roll 2d6 and sum them -- anything above a 10 grants players a bonus, but anything under a 7 is a failed action. Once an action is failed, jump back to the planning phase -- failing here was all part of the plan. Explain how your failure was all part of the plan, and how you move forward now.

Once a player is in the vault, all bets are off. No more planning stage, just action in the moment. The person who walks out with the money wins.

## Anti Heroes

```
The future. In the stellar void.
Humanity is dying. Centuries of war has ended galactic conquest and procreation is but a memory. We are doomed.

Still a light seems to burn low in the darkness. The apostle writings are formals, Mankind will find a way if the holy relic of Foedric was to be found again.

But all heroes are dead. We are alone. Only the worst ones remains. And they are our only chance to survive.
Jeriko “Ivan the terrible”
Horus “Ramses”
Stunner ”Attila”
Okto ”Gengis Khan”
Firefly ”Saladin”
Dirt ”Erik the Red”
Malebot ”Vlad Tepes”

Anti Heroes put you in the role of the most dangerous badass of the entire galaxy.
Former military gone mad in warzone, bodyparts dealers from the most violent syndicates of the solar system or renown murderers just escaped from maximum security, each of them has a part of the riddle somewhere in their twisted mind.

Captured by the Apostles of the Funeral Cathedral, they have accepted a suicide mission which may grant them salvation if they manage to find the last chance to save what’s left of humanity.

Hoping who they used to be in a previous life can be kept under control.

## Looking for new recruits!

```
The age of space exploration. A violent and uncertain time for the crew of this generic spaceship. Valued crew members are replaced by new recruits, more incompetent than ever. Feels like a low budget sci-fi TV show? Maybe it is.

Your ship is (under attack / crash-landing / falling apart in hyperspace / stuck in customs / rat-infested / drifting powerless), your mission is to (find the mole / deliver aid / escort diplomats / make first contact / mutiny / find out why cameramen follow you).

Recruits
Choose a field of specialty.
For skill checks roll a d6. Add +2 if specialty is relevant.
On a natural 1 you fail spectacularly and another crewman dies horribly.
He is replaced by an incompetent new recruit, who subtracts -1 from each roll.

Once per session a recruit can choose to automatically succeed at a task, but another recruit will have to die with a -2 penalty to her rolls.

Death penalty is cumulative. The last person to roll a 6 is the one to die.

Only one recruit can aid another if possible. Add +1 to result.

Task resolution
Difficulty ranges from 5 (everyday responsibilities) to 11 (impossible). If the recruit rolls:
Difficulty-1: yes, but…
Difficulty: yes.
Difficulty+1: yes, and...

## The Things We Do For Love

```
2 Players and a Judge

The players decide on a familial relationship (siblings, parent/child, cousins, etc.)

The judge determines a setting (modern world, fantasy, sci-fi, horror, etc.)

Player one has something (money, gold coins, a piece of technology, a cursed dagger, etc. This is determined by the Judge) that Player two wants. Player two has to convince player one to give it to them, while Player one refuses. In the course of the argument, Player one and Player two make up their mutual history. The Judge keeps track of said history and determines the winner based on most creative back-story and reasons for needing the item/not being able to give it up. A player who incorrectly refers to a previously mentioned point of mutual history has automatically lost the argument and therefore the game.

## Night clubbing

```
We are old friends reuniting or bored youth looking for more.
We are on a night out in a metropolitan city of delights or an asphalt mile of dive bars.
Each character toasts the night ahead and their companions, they take a drink token.
Narrate your night together, take turns, go slowly.
When you want to do something that might matter; roll a d6 and score higher than your drink tokens.
If you succeed, narrate your success, otherwise take a drink token, choose an option and change your location:
* Tell everyone a secret about yourself
* Tell someone what you really think about them
* Buy everyone a round, everyone gets a drink token, salut!
* Bring the group into jeopardy by antagonising someone dangerous or going somewhere you shouldn't
* Provoke the authorities and flee the consequences with your companions
* Shame yourself
When you have six drink tokens; pass out. Once each scene you may narrate a strange vision for the others which may or may not be real.
When there are only two characters left decide whether they are going to go home together.
If not then narrate an omen of your collective alcoholic oblivion, otherwise describe the dawn arriving.

## The Orpheus Trail

```
The road to Hell is paved with the bodies and possessions of the settlers who went ahead of you. Rumor says the colonists of the first circle of Hell mine rare minerals and grow rich off strange soul-powered sciences. Meanwhile Earth swelters, overcrowded and suffering. How different could it be?

Three types of people take the risk: SINNERS, SCIENTISTS, and SECURITY.

SINNERS shorten the road to Hell by SINNING. SCIENTISTS and SECURITY can FIGHT DEMONS, PERFORM TECHNOMAGIC, and LOOT NEARBY RUINS, but they are at the mercy of the SINNERS for travel.

The colonist caravan will not reach the first circle of Hell until the characters have performed all seven mortal sins: GLUTTONY, LUST, GREED, PRIDE, WRATH, ENVY, and SLOTH.

SINNERS may teach other characters to SIN, but by doing so they surrender their power over the caravan. Many SINNERS are press-ganged, unwillingly recruited from prison. Extort your fellow colonists for the best chance at a new life! Or teach them what you know in exchange for TECHNOMAGIC and SAFE HAVEN.

Establish character relationships. Take turns starting scenes. Survive demon attacks, ford rivers of blood or pay the ferryman, and gaze on the ruined wonders of the afterlife. Adventure awaits!

## Survivors on an Uncharted Island

```
You are plane crash survivors on an uncharted island.

Rescue is impossible.

Define each main character survivor with an intriguing question (e.g. why is Amanda pretending to be amnesiac?). Once per session, you may add a question to a survivor you don’t play. If any character has no questions, they can die.

You may play multiple survivors. 

---

Anyone may say “Try it a different way” or “Go deeper” if they feel something is inappropriate or superficial.

---

On an index card, draw a line to represent the coast where you’ve crashed. ALWAYS define questions (on adjacent cards) for the nearest uncharted areas. Anyone may create a question. Each question should potentially have mundane and weird explanations. Insert or modify cards when you discover new areas or resolve questions.

Cards can go down, in, or backwards (in time).

Assign a player to be the Authority on what’s true about each new aspect of the island.

If an action is risky or the outcome unknown, define (as a group) the worst, best, and in-between outcomes. Roll 1d6: 1 = worst, 6 = best. The appropriate Authority (or, if none, a group-nominee) narrates.

---

Play to answer questions and see if anyone escapes the island.

## The Beasts Shall No Longer Walk This Earth

```
You are Beast Hunters. Each of you write:
your family name
your talent
one thing you brought
one thing your mentor taught

These are your ELEMENTS.

You are hunting a Beast. Take turns describing:
	its name
	what it looks like
	the most dangerous thing about it
	why it must be hunted
	why it’s hard to hunt
	where it’s found

Note them. These are the Beast’s ELEMENTS.

When you journey to hunt the Beast, take turns describing.

If you do something tough, or against the Beast, roll 1d10.
Add 1 for each your ELEMENTS that apply,
Subtract 1 for each of the Beast’s ELEMENTS that works against you.

If you get a total of 7 or higher, success. Otherwise, failure.

Success: the Beast loses an ELEMENT. Choose which. When it has none left, it is slain.
Failure: choose one ELEMENT to lose (explain why). If you have none left, you die.

If you kill the Beast, everyone adds an ELEMENT of what they learned. Make a new Beast as before, but add one ELEMENT for each previous Beast slain.
If you are killed, the Beast gains an ELEMENT. (describe what)
If everyone is killed, a new group will fight the Beast.
```

## Storyboard

```
You are cartoon characters, and you must draw your way to the promised land.

You will each need:

Your favorite pencil
Some index cards
A timer

Whoever has the weirdest doodle in their notebook leads first.

When you lead, tell the followers what the obstacle is and how long they have to solve it.

When you follow, take that time to draw yourself overcoming the obstacle. You all draw at the same time, in secret. Pencils down when the leader says so.

When time is up, the leader chooses the funniest solution. That drawing goes on the end of the storyboard, moving everyone towards the promised land. The others branch off anywhere else on the storyboard; they’re the misadventures you had on the way.

The game ends when the storyboard reaches the edge of the table you’re playing on, or if anyone gets bored or checks their cell phone. If it’s the former, you each write down one thing about the promised land in secret, then reveal it at the same time. All these things are true.

If it’s the latter, gather your notecards. Your characters never reached the promised land, and are trapped forever in your backpack.
```

## Godzilla Is Attacking The City

```
You are victims of Godzilla’s rampage through the city. Your lives are flashing before your eyes. You each take turns telling your stories.

Make a list of Words to use in your stories. Adjectives and verbs work best for this. Ten Words per player should be enough.
 
Each player has six health points.

The tallest player goes first.

Tell your story. When you use one of the Words, roll a six-sided die (d6). If the result is six, you don’t lose any health and take another turn. A result of two through five subtracts one health and ends your turn. A result of one angers Godzilla and your location is attacked. Lose two health and end your turn. You may only use one Word per turn and may not use a Word more than once per game.

When your health reaches zero, you die.  

You may attempt to steal the turn by making a cameo. Yell, “Godzilla is attacking the city!” Then, use the last Word the active player used in your cameo, but only if you haven’t used it yet. The two players roll a d6. The player who rolled highest continues their story.
```
<hr> 

## As the Crow Flies

```
The Crows have offered absolution; secrets for salvation.

To play you’ll need a...
...trusted consort
...small coffer and key
...city to roam and wander

One of you must bear the Coffer, the other the Key. Begin by placing a secret into the Coffer, one each.

Secrets are…
*Known only by you
*Devastating if revealed
*Intimately connected to a Nexus
*Written on scraps of paper

When you bear the Key, keep it safe.

When you bear the Coffer, spend your days walking through the City alone as if you did not carry such dark secrets. Follow the crows to the places they gather, search for the things which have fallen through the cracks; something, anything that reminds you of one of your Secrets. This is your Nexus. 

Now find your consort, place your Nexus and its corresponding Secret into the Coffer, and choose 1:
*Unburden Yourself
*Make your Offering

When you unburden yourself, exchange the Coffer for the Key and all related duties.

When you make your offering, travel together. Your destination must be:
*Far from Home
*Windswept
*Watched Over by Crows

When you reach your destination, open the Coffer. Leave. Hope against all hope that they find your offering worthwhile.

Lite RPG System

Skills
Each player names their character, distributes Skill Points [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] to:
•Ability (constitution, strength)
•Aptitude (dexterity, intelligence)
•Attention (wisdom, charisma)
•Assets (wealth, equipment)
•Arcane (magic, alchemy)
HP: 5 + sum of lowest two [Ability, Aptitude, Attention]

Actions
Define five Actions, one per Skill:
“[Skill] - [Name]: When I [condition] and my foes [condition] then I [awesome].”
Example: “Ability - Whirlwind: When I am surrounded and my foes fear me then I attack everyone nearby.”
Players may use each Action once/Rest. No roll required.

Gameplay
GM describes scenes, presents challenges. When players attempt something interesting: GM determines Skill used, requests Check.

Checks
GM chooses difficulty (standard is 2; each complication +1).
Player rolls d6 dice equal to Skill Points. On each die: 4+ succeed and 6 explode (always roll 6s again, counting successes). 
If fewer successes than Difficulty: 
•Fail the Check (GM narrates outcome)
•Lose [Difficulty - successes] HP
•Gain 1 XP

Rests
Rest for 1 hour: regain all HP. Optionally train one skill: spend XP equal to its Skill Points to increase it by 1 or rewrite its Action.

Endgame
•Death at 0 HP.
•Ascend at 25 total Skill Points. Describe how this changes the world.

## The Orb

```
In a distant future, the orb is one of the key parts of human existence.

Discuss the following:
• what is the orb's functions?
• what are the orb's components, and how does it look like?
• what groups are affected by the orb or have a relation to it? Name at least three.

Each participant come up with a character of their own that has something to do with one or several of the groups. At least three groups should be represented by all the participants' characters. Each participant declares the agenda of the character, which is a version of the following three:
• steal the orb
• change the orb
• destroy the orb

During the declaration, it's also important to tell why the character has that agenda (even if it may be a secret).

The game ends when more than half of the participants can reach their goals through terms of agreement.

Discuss how.

<hr> 

## After the Rain

```
Divide your players into 2 factions: The Mark, a single person; and The Agents, everyone else. The Mark is a target of the Agents, mercenary AI who are infiltrating their digital subconscious to find and steal a thing of value. The Mark deals 10 playing cards face down in front of them. They ask the Agents “who am I and what do you want from me?” The Agents respond with their answer, collectively. That answer is the Mark’s last card in their deck.

When play begins, the mark flips over a card and describes the space the Agents now occupy: Hearts are someplace liminal; spades are someplace ancient; clubs are someplace foreign; diamonds are someplace hostile. Face cards are populated by one or many other intelligences, the number represents how challenging the level is to clear. With each new level, the Mark declares their conditions for clearing the level; once these conditions are met they flip the card over and reveal the next level. Agents take turns declaring actions they take to complete the Mark’s conditions, the Mark counters with questions, elaborations, and challenges. Once the final card is reached, the Mark reminds the Agents of what they are taking.

## Muscle/brains/gut

```
You're a small group of Neanderthals trying to survive. Hunting wooly mammoths, foraging the wilderness for edible plants, sickness and especially encounters with Homo Sapiens endanger your existence.

You have 3 options to tackle problems: muscle (rock), brains (paper) and gut (scissors).  Every action is decided by a game of muscle/brains/gut (rock/paper/scissors) between the player and the GM. Every tie makes the consequences of a win/loss bigger, possible consequences of a win or loss should be communicated beforehand by the GM. After at least 4 ties in a row the game ends when the player or the GM eventually wins the game of muscle/brains/gut. Consequences are total species loss or species domination, depending on who wins.

Muscle: solve problems with strength, fighting, ...
Brains: solve problems by thinking, smartness, ...
Gut: solve problems by a luck, quick reactions, …

## Secret Identity

```
Being superheroes Disrupts your lives, played with a deck of cards. Before starting decide how many “weeks” to play. One round, one week.

Draw a random card from each suit as your character’s “Stats”. The suits represent four major Categories. Face cards=10, Ace=11.

Hearts-Love
Clubs-Social
Spades-Work/School
Diamonds-Appearance/Reputation

Happiness increases from 0-10, starting at 4.

Once/Round you may Spend 1 Happiness to draw a replacement Stat card for any category/character, even Empty. Spend again to add the Draw to the Stat instead of replacing it.

Each Round, draw a card for the Disruption (sneaking out, hiding bruises, sudden battle, etc.) and compare against Stat. 

Underperform: When your Stat < Draw, “Threaten” the Stat by turning its card sideways and discard the Draw. Lose one Happiness. You still use this card. 

Empty: Underperforming with a threatened Stat instead leaves the Stat Empty until replaced. Lose 3 Happiness. Comparing against Empty Stats reduces happiness by 1 instead.

Overcome: When your Stat > Draw, replace Stat with Draw, gain one Happiness. For every difference of 5 gain one more. It doesn’t matter if your Stat was threatened when replaced.

(Recommended: representing Happiness with candy or the cards you overcome.)

## Rubble

```
You have survived the apocalypse. The wastes around you has taken its toll on your group. Between the bandits, starvation, and hunting creatures, you and the other survivors must make sacrifices to protect those that are left; your family and loved ones.

Materials: 
Notecards
Timer
Coins
4-Sided Die (d4)

1. Each player writes down their character name and 3 Things on a note-card. These “Things” can include anything the players can think of in a group of survivors. At least one should include another survivor in the group.  
	Something to Protect 
	Something to Keep Secret
	Something Worth Fighting For

2. Danger has struck, roll the d4 to determine it.
	1. Bandits
	2. Starvation
	3. Creature
	4. Equipment Failure

3. Discuss with the others what the danger is and who should face the it. The players have 10 minutes for this. The player(s) who face the danger take a coin. If none of the players face it, cross one item off of a note-card.

4. The game ends when one player gains 5 coins, when a total of 12 Things have been crossed out, or when one player has crossed out all of their things.

## An uncertain trial

```
A scene begins. An accusatory statement about one of the players is made. The accused player rolls a die. A higher number means the accusation is more truthful, lower meaning it is more false. Only the accused player may now the result, and can interpret the roll freely if enough ambiguity exists. Any player who wishes to participate in the scene may do so freely. The players must decide if the accusation is true and deal out punishment if it is. The accused must avoid punishment without revealing the roll. The scene proceeds with as many players as desired, for as long as the players desire. At the end of the scene it is revealed how truthful the accusation was. If the players make the wrong choice, they lose. If the accused is punished, he/she loses.

## Myrathine

```
A nameless protector spirit of the forested island Myrathine notices strange invaders on its shores that have begun to destroy the island ecosystem.
The player assumes control of the spirit and has to fight back against the human settlement and its relentless robotic workers to protect the island from destruction.
However, the spirit has no corporeal form and must possess wildlife or humans in order to affect the physical world.
Possessing wildlife allows for direct combat with the robots, but each killed animal vessel will damage the ecosystem as well.
Possessed humans are never attacked by their robots, but must find clever noncombat solutions to encounters since the humans themselves cannot fight.
The situation gets increasingly complicated as the motivation of the humans is slowly revealed over time.
They have to destroy the island and harness a strange power that slumbers beneath it in order to save the rest of the world from annihilation.
The spirit can then either ally itself to a destruction opposed, middle ground seeking splinter faction among the humans, continue the campaign against all human invaders, help them destroy the island to save the world or try and claim the slumbering power for itself.

## Treaty at the Stones of Black and White

```

Learn Go. Play.

Half to 3/4 of the way through the game, pause.  Hold peace talks and negotiations. 

Each player rolls a d6 for a Secret objective.  
1.	Randomly select a personal enemy. 
2.	Get the captured stones released.
3.	Gain control of another formation on the board.
4.	Grow your territory by placing stones on the board.  
5.	Secure a Trade route.  Gain a right-of-way from every player the route passes.
6.	Make your own.  

Each player chooses a formation on the board.  That is their army, tribe, or geographic region.  Deal a card from any deck, Magic, tarot or standard playing cards.  

Take turns introducing yourself, using your card and area on the board.  Then roll a die publicly, odd you are loyal (to the color your formation is made from) even you are treacherous.  Then secretly roll a die. Loyal players have only a 25% chance of choosing to betray their color and only to secure their secret objective. Treacherous players will stay loyal 25% of the time.  The other 75% they can betray if they want. 

Start negotiations. The war isn’t over.  In turn order if you chose, you may place a stone.

```

## SYSTEM

```
You need two players: one plays the ENFORCER, second plays the SYSTEM.

First the ENFORCER:
So, you are enforcer/secret policeman/other for an oppressive regime. 
Regime wasn't always like that.

You joined in because:
- you were poor and this work had great promise
- you believed in the specific ideals of the SYSTEM
- something else

ENFORCER: name the ideals important for you, at least 3, you get IDEALS 3.
SYSTEM: add another 3 ideals to the list.

SYSTEM player starts to describe how those ideas get implemented, how they are supposed to work.
For each idea collaboratively think what ugly thing it could make ENFORCER do.

ENFORCER, roll: 2d6+IDEALS
On 10+ : you can't ignore it. Tell SYSTEM you stand up against it.
SYSTEM: Explain to ENFORCER why he is wrong and add consequence (for him).
7-9 : You can pick - you either challenge (see 10+), or ignore it (IDEALS -1, cross off one)
6- : You can't change it. You get IDEALS -1.

When you get to 0 IDEALS, you can walk away, but there is cost. SYSTEM has to name three things that will affect you and your family. Ugly things.

Jointly decide how it ends.
I'm sorry.

## The Chronicles of...

```
One player introduces themselves as the Archivist; traveller, tale-keeper, and stranger to these lands. Your clothes are well-worn and foreign; your pack is heavy with inks and tomes. Wandering, you’ve happened upon a small group of local people. Describe yourself to them.

The other players are inhabitants of this land, full of tales and histories. Take a moment together to discuss what makes this place unique, then tell the Archivist what you call it. Describe your immediate surroundings and why you’re there.

The Archivist asks questions, prompting stories about the land and its people.

While an inhabitant tells a story, another may say, “Isn’t it the case that…” The storyteller (or someone else) will either revise the story, working in this detail, or explain how that is, in fact, not that case.

If an inhabitant has personal knowledge on a matter, they may say “You’re lying, here’s the truth…” The storyteller (or someone else) will either recant, reworking the tale in light of this, or refute the claim.

At any time the Archivist may ask for more details, or say, “In [another land, giving details] they say that…” The inhabitants will acknowledge or deny any relation.

## Watch Out! Heartfelt Magical Girl Clash!

```
Players: 3-6
Bring: Printout, colored pencils. 

This battle has been tougher than most: fend off your Magical Adversary while achieving the emotional state needed to defeat them. 

Each Girl’s name: a color. (“Vermillion”)

NAMES:



Each has a Wound--emotional? Physical?--that she’s taken. When?

WOUNDS:



Each feels an Emotion: (Circle yours) 

Fury / Serenity / Sorrow / Overwhelm / Love / Terror / Excitement / Trust / Inadequacy / Confidence / Guilt / Apathy 

Narrate: Why?

Each has a Fabulous Magical Accessory!

ACCESSORIES:



Your Adversary is: (circle three)

Manipulative / Brutal / Overwhelming / Scarred / Untouchable / Opulent / Toxic / Mutable / Sympathetic / Incomprehensible / Beautiful / Familiar

Your Adversary’s vulnerable to Girls feeling an un-circled emotion. Which? Why? Underline it.

The player with longest hair goes first. 

On your turn, choose one:

Clash!: narrate Adversary action/dialogue, your evasion/reaction: Elegant, Clever, Tough, or Desperate. Moved, one other Girl changes her Emotion. 

Flashback!: play a flashback with another Girl. Change each other's Emotions. 

Promise!: as the battle rages, speak your Promise to another Girl. Extend your hand: if she takes it and speaks, one of you changes her Emotion to match the other. If not, she changes yours.

Triumph!: If a Girl feels the underlined Emotion, -OR- all Girls feel the same Emotion, narrate your (Spectacular? Hard-won? Pyrrhic?) victory!

## So here is the Scenario

```
This is a game for four to five and one DM the DM pitches a scenario  and gives form to the setting and situation. The players then roll dice and highest begins taking place in the scene as a character. Play goes round table the next person takes over DM duties making sure to complete these task during play as more people take over everyone stays in the scene and things grow more interesting.

1. Move forward - This can be anything not just "moving" but they must make forward motion in some way in the scene.

2. Act upon the setting and find an impedance.

3. Find or introduce a new aspect that might help the situation

4. Act towards your next action and pass the narrative while introducing yourself as a character.

And then as the first player passes  the next DM takes control each round should be about 10-12 minutes once every player has gone once the first DM sets up the finish.During which the group goes one more time around as the players work together to end the scenario. 

```
<hr> 

## And We Are All Together

```
Stare at the player on your left. Blink slowly. When you open your eyes, your body has been possessed by the mind of the player on your right.

As a group you have one hour to work out what just happened, why it's happened to you, and how to reverse it. If you don't then the effects get weirder. 

Each of you knows one relevant thing. Each of you also has one secret or repressed memory, which you will recall if another player confronts you about it.

## This Is Not an RPG

```
Inspired by the automatic techniques of surrealist artists.

Requirements: Friends, pencils, paper, a game spinner or paper folded into a point that you can spin, absinthe (optional)

1. Goal: Each player writes a verb, adjective and noun. Spin to determine whose answer fills each blank. If a player is selected multiple times, spin again.

"We must [VERB] the [ADJECTIVE] [NOUN]."

Write the completed goal on a separate piece of paper.

2. Characters: Each player writes entries for the bracketed words below. Spin to select a player. Spin again to select their character's first name, then go clockwise to fill in the rest. Repeat for each player, respinning if necessary.

"I'm [FIRST NAME] [LAST NAME], a [ADJECTIVE] [NOUN]. My ability is [ABILITY]. My weakness is [WEAKNESS]."

Write the completed character descriptions below the goal.

3. Begin: Each player writes a sentence to establish the start of the scenario. Spin. The selected player expands on their sentence, describing what happens (in two minutes or less) using the goal and character descriptions as a guide, and ending at a moment of decision/uncertainty.

4. Play: Repeat step 3, describing what happens next. Continue until the goal succeeds, fails -- or something else entirely.

## Petty Crimes

```
Players play a gang of petty criminals trying to make ends meet.

Each player requires a 52-card deck.

To create a character distribute 10 points among these abilities (minimum 0, maximum 5):
Brawn– strength, toughness
Reflexes– quickness, coordination
Senses– awareness, intuition
Brains– intelligence, memory

At the start of the game, the GM draws five cards from their deck and places them face-up in the middle of the table. These are the communal cards. Use the suits of the communal cards to help determine the type of crime, or choose your own.
Hearts– drug related
Diamonds– burglary
Clubs– extortion
Spades– theft, fencing
The number of cards in the suit of your crime represents the size of the payoff. Highest value card represents the difficulty.

When the GM presents a challenge, they assign it a rating and draw that many cards. Players draw cards equal to the ability being tested. Using these cards, and the five communal cards, each player makes a 5-card poker hand. Players must beat the GM to succeed, or each other for inter-character conflict. Once resolved, all cards are discarded and the GM redraws the communal cards. Players reshuffle their decks when all their cards have been discarded.

## Fair Verona Burns: A Tragedy in Three Acts

```
“These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which, as they kiss, consume.”

Collaboratively detail a setting and 10+ hot-blooded characters evenly representing two feuding factions. Detail characters: “[Name], the [adjective] [noun].”

Take turns: Frame a scene featuring any two characters and select one to roleplay. Another player roleplays the second. Remaining players may roleplay additional characters as dramatically appropriate. After every scene, collaboratively assign one-way Passions (hate, love, or exploiting) among participating characters.

Act One (scenes 1-3): No open violence. End after satisfying escalation.

Act Two (scenes 4+): End scenes when someone dies. Roleplay until someone attacks, embraces (with consent), or exploits one or more others. All involved roll 1d6. Lowest roller loses and narrates scene outcomes (ties both lose): 
  --Attack = loser dies.
  --Embrace = winner’s ally dies (probably off-screen)
  --Exploit = loser’s ally dies (probably off-screen)

Act Three (when 2-3 characters remain): Collaboratively resolve a climax and fallout. Each remaining character rolls 1d6 per Passion, and pursues the highest-rolled Passion (choose among ties). If pursued Passions match, resolve accordingly. Otherwise, characters each roll 1d6 and narrate by the winner’s pursued Passion. 

Is your tale ultimately tragic, reconciliatory, ugly, cathartic, or something else altogether?
