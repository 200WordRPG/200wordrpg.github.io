## Caper

```
Each player names and describes one member of a team of thieves.

Place a coin in plain sight, describe a stake; the reason the thief is willing to risk everything.

Each player adds a second coin, proposing a priceless treasure to steal.  Agree the most popular suggestion.

Discuss and agree the treasure’s location.  Each player secretly writes two challenges (defences or complications associated with the treasure) on separate scraps of paper.  

Thieves double-cross the team, taking the treasure for themselves, if their player takes and conceals a coin until the end of the game without being noticed.

Describe the thieves’ arrival at the location.  

Randomly draw a challenge the team must overcome.  Each player describes how their thief contributes to overcoming it and flips a coin, calling heads or tails.  If successful, one advance is recorded.  If not, the player to their left describes a setback befalling the thief.  Thieves may make multiple contributions to each challenge.

The number of advances needed to overcome each challenge is equal to the number of words describing it, plus one.  The prize is successfully stolen when the thieves overcome challenges equal to the number of players.

Any thief suffering four setbacks is eliminated.

## Pasta Master

```
You are Powerful and Dedicated Martial Artists competing to determine who is the Pasta Master by eating Pasta, the Ultimate Energy Source.

Each Competitor has a Name, Costume and Ingredient (Anything all players can eat). Put each Name on a Tournament Bracket.

Wander to a Market and get any Ingredients you need: Pasta, the chosen Ingredients, salt, pepper, garlic, olive oil, and other staples.

Boil salted water in a big pot, and prepare many saucepans. When it boils, add the pasta, removing only when ready. Ensure Pasta flows constantly, like a river.

Another Competitor makes the sauce for their battle. It must contain both player's chosen Ingredients, and should be as tasty as possible. Olive oil, spices and garlic make a fine base. Deliberately making gross food is highly dishonorable.

The Pasta is then served, stopping when 1 competitor says to stop. Starting after the cry "Allez Cuisine!", The players then race to finish their Pasta first. The fastest Competitor moves ahead, and the cycle repeats with the next Competitors.

If there's an odd number of Competitors, the remainder eats a bowl of Pasta, on their own.

The final victor is the Pasta Master, and doesn't have to clean up.

## Divine intervention

```
You are gods. One of thousands of gods. Each god controls one aspect of reality. You might be in charge of travel, animals, thunder, battle or whatever you decide. Write your name and domain.

You all follow a party of adventurers on their quest. Each of you has a secret goal for the party (in line with chosen domain). Maybe you want them to succeed? Or for the cleric to survive? Maybe you want to kill them all? Gods are sometimes pricks like that. Write your goal and keep it hidden from others.

One of you is not a god. He narrates what happens to the party. But whenever the party stumbles on an obstacle that’s in the domain of one of the players - that player decides the outcome.

Gods also have 5 artifacts each. They can use one or more to bribe another player to decide the outcome in their favor. Alternatively, they can influence any other aspect of reality by discarding 3 artifacts (to pay for services of appropriate god).

The surviving party members, if any, make a sacrifice to honor the god that fulfilled the most impressive goal. Go follow another party.

## Crazy Greedy Hitler Puppet

```
Astonishingly, a crazy, greedy Hitler puppet has been elected leader of your country. He's a Muppets-style puppet, but like Hitler, with the mustache, ideology, etc. He's crazy, even a layperson can diagnose that he's not quite right in the head. He's greedy, he is to money what Cookie Monster is to cookies. And he's a puppet, which means he's manipulated by a puppeteer and has no genuine thoughts or beliefs of his own.

You're national-level politicians. On your turn, introduce yourself and your Perfectly Reasonable Proposal. Have a group discussion to determine why the leader opposes this, because he's crazy, greedy, Hitler, or a puppet. However! In this discussion only the words “crazy”, “greedy”, “Hitler”, and “puppet” are allowed. (Try talking louder if people aren't agreeing with you). If you can't agree within one minute randomly determine one of the four aspects.

The chosen aspect informs roleplaying out one or more brief scenes about how your proposal is either crushed or enacted in monstrous form (other players can play NPCs).

Go around the table twice, creating a new Perfectly Reasonable Proposal each turn. If you died, were imprisoned, or were otherwise incapacitated create a new character for your second round.

## Charon

```
Lie your back on the floor with three friends near, your heads together. Each fare has two identical coins. Place the coins on your eyelids. One fare should remove their coins, read one line, flip coins in the air and return them to their eyes as instructed, and then pass the script until no coins remain. If a fare has no coins, they read, but pass the opposite direction.

*At the edge of the river filled with souls, Charon invites you.* (Flip both coins, return heads, max one.)

*In the boat, Charon guides you.* (Flip both coins, return tails, max one.)

The river’s dead reach for you. (Flip one coin, return heads, max one.)

*At the shore, Charon bids you farewell.* (Flip one coin, return tails, max one.)

*You step forth, but look back.* (Flip both coins, replace or keep one.)

_When all coins remain on the ground, count the number of heads and tails for each fare._

_Those with both can choose to move forward or stay._
*We choose our fate this day.*

_Heads move forward._
*We don’t look back, but step forward.*

_Tails fall behind into the river._
*We cannot step forward, and fall.*

## Shadows

```
A haunting mystery for a player and a GM.

Here's what you've learned in the week since you were murdered. Either you’re the only ghost, or ghosts can’t see each other. Nobody living can see or hear you. You can't touch anything, but you can’t do any cool ghost shit like walk through walls either. 

Except… If you concentrate really hard, you can make your presence known. You can be seen, briefly, or make someone hear you whispering in their ear. Moving stuff takes a lot of effort, but it’s doable.

But then, the Shadows come. You don’t know what they are. You’ve never seen them clearly, but you’ve got their attention. And they’re getting closer.
When you affect the living world, take a token and roll a d10. If you roll under your total number of tokens, a Shadow appears. Narrate how you try to get away, then roll again. If you roll under again, the Shadow catches you. Even Death ends.

Tell the GM five people who were important to you in life. One of them murdered you, but you don’t know who. Can you find out who killed you, and why, before the Shadows devour you?

## The Tale

```
You are the Initiate, a man whose story and virtues are being tested. Your friends are the Council listening to you. Both of you take up to fifteen Bones.

Initiate, say who you are, your Qualities and Flaws.
Describe your Challenge (save, recover, defend, etc.).You will discover during play if you obtained your Goal or not.
Describe the Virtue at stake (courage, mercy, loyalty, etc.) and declare:

"I am [name], and I'm here to tell you how my [Virtue] was challenged while I tried to [Challenge]."

To play narrate your journey toward your goal. The Council will help you by suggesting how the world reacts. Last word is yours.
When Virtue is at stake the Council can decide that things are not how you describe. They will say "Lie", declare a different outcome and remove one of their Bones. You can accept by saying "Truth", or refuse by saying "Lie" and removing one of your Bones. Tell a different outcome. Continue with Lie/Truth until one does not accept.

The story will end when Initiate or Council remove their last stone. End it in a meaningful way, saying what happened and if something shattered your Virtue or Goal.

## Travelling is not so easy...

```
Take or make a map of your (fantasy or reality) city. Overlay a grid of hexagons; scale it such that it takes 1 hour to walk between hexes (or 20 minutes to ride or drive).

You have a destination (where?) that should be reached soon (why?).

Every three hexes walked (9 ridden), you must eat (how?).
Every nine hexes walked (27 ridden), you must sleep (how?).

Every hour, there is a chance of finding something entangling. Roll a six-sided die (d6), then ask the person to the right of the last person asked.

[1] Someone/something tells you that something important or useful (what?) is just up ahead.
[2] Someone who owes you something (or who is bound to you by honour) is seen. Do you try to avoid them?
[3] There is something valuable (what?) nearby (where?), but it is moving away (why?).
[4] There is something dangerous (what?) nearby (where?), and it is moving towards you (why?).
[5] Someone to whom you owe something (or who is bound to you by hatred) is seen. Do you try to avoid them?
[6] Someone/something tells you that you should never come back here (why not?).

Good luck.

## Monster Slayer Academy

```
You are about to graduate from Monster Slayer Academy. Your final exam: slay a monster. Before you depart, you must prepare. Convince teachers and fellow students to give you gear that increases your dice. Brew life-saving potions while you can. Then, you must track the beast through the wild while talking to its surviving victims, fending off bandits, and solving smaller problems along the way. Finally, your search culminates in a climactic encounter with the beast.

You roll xd6 and count successes. A success is a roll higher than three.
Task Difficulty	Successes Required
Easy			1
Moderate		2
Challenging		3
Difficult			4


x=your grade in one of four classes.
Grade		Amount of Dice
A			5
B			4
C			3
D			2

Assign A, B, C, and D to your classes.
-Monster Fighting: Fight monsters (and people.) Each fighter rolls. Compare successes. The loser receives the difference in injury.
-Monster Tracking: Track and avoid detection.
-Monster Taming: Befriend certain monsters, including people.
-Potions Brewing: Create potions that temporarily increase dice or heal injury. A dice increase of one is an easy task, an injury of one is an easy task to heal, and so on.

## Defy. Subvert. Outwit.

```
You have three ways to approach adversities: Defy, Subvert, or Outwit. Any approach can be used in any situation: crossing blades, scaling cliffs, talking to guards, throwing fireballs, or picking locks, as long as your narration matches the approach. Distribute the following numbers among your approaches: four, six, and eight. Roll a d10 under your approach to succeed. Roll a d10 and match your approach to critically succeed.

Failing to overcome an adversity often means that you get hurt. When you get hurt, the GM narrates your injury, whether there’s a knife in your gut or broken ribs in your chest. After four injuries, you’re out of the game. This could mean that you are unconscious, captured, or dead, according to the desires of the GM, or even your fellow players.

At the end of each session, one of your approaches increases by one. Each approach has a maximum value of ten, and you can only have up to six such increases.

## Detachment 626

```
Introduction
Detachment 626 is a relic from a time when imaginations believed in threats beyond their science. Made up of people fighting to make a difference, tasked with a mission everyone else has abandoned. Slowly Failing.
You might wish you had said no to the recruiter, but now the only way out is feet first.
Operative
Narrate your operative's description, background, and recruitment. Decide on a Concept and a Trouble. Choose 5 skills, and assign 1, 2, and 3 between the stats: Mundane (operating in the world), Odd (operating with the supernatural), and Agency (operating in the Detachment).
Gameplay
When the stakes are high, choose a skill and stat. Take 2d6- one positive, one negative. Roll, subtracting the negative from the positive. Add stat, -2 if no skill applies.
> 0: Player narrates.
< 0: GM narrates.
= 0: Player narrates, GM narrates price.
Players roll dice. Each success gives the GM Downfall, which can be spent anytime to subtract one from a roll, justified by the operative’s Concept, Trouble, or current situation. The GM tracks operative statuses, and keeps them posted. An operative that takes two hits in the same conflict is in a world of hurt.

## Crisis Ascending

```
Each hand, one player, Crisis, deals three Heroes clockwise seven cards each from the 7-K of four suits, keeping the remaining seven.  The final Hero dealt is Chosen.

Crisis discards blindly from any player’s hand.  Its suit becomes Ascendant.  The hand begins.

Each round, Crisis plays a card face-down, boasting of its power.  Chosen must then play their own boast.  Then, other heroes may boast or pass.  Each boast should show unbridled imagination, but must unambiguously name the card’s suit OR value (else be discarded).  Allow one minute each.

The cards revealed, the highest Ascendant wins, or else the highest following Crisis’ suit.  The winning Hero, or the next Hero standing, becomes Chosen.  The winner keeps one defeated card (without revealing which), discarding the rest, and awards 1 point to themselves or their favorite boast.

Hands end when Crisis holds no cards, or all cards, receiving an additional point for each card remaining.  The final Chosen becomes Crisis.  Hands also end if anyone holds all and only 7’s -- they Ascend, receiving 28 points and becoming Crisis!

If a winning hero has over 60 points, the world is saved.  If a winning or ascending Crisis has over 77, it is doomed!

## Take a Drink: the Roledrinking Game

```
At the start of TaD, the GM describes a mission and gives everyone a drink. Everyone then makes a character; choose the character's Class; Hacker, Doctor, Soldier, etc.

When your character tries something hard, the GM secretly chooses a number between 1 and 5; higher number means harder task. Then, you take any number of drinks. If you Class is good at the task, the GM takes the first drink for you. If you drank at least the GM's number, you succeed and the GM must take a drink; two if they chose 4 or higher. If you didn't drink enough, you fail and you must pour roughly 1 drink of your drink into the GM's drink.

If your drink runs out, you crash. You fail (if trying a task), the GM describes a twist of fate against you and replaces your drink. If you suffer three crashes, the GM can remove your character (kill, capture, etc). If every character is removed, the mission fails and the game ends.

If the GM's drink runs out, they replace it; if they run out again, the mission succeeds and the game ends.

## Where'd It All Go Wrong?

```
The job went wrong. It wasn’t pretty. The team split up to avoid death or capture. The remaining accomplices have met at the rendezvous to answer one question: “Where’d it all go wrong?”

Each accomplice rolls 1d6. Ties are rerolled.

The accomplice with the lowest roll picks the job, or rolls 1d6:

1. Frame-Up
2. Heist
3. Kidnap
4. Sabotage
5. Surveillance
6. Transport

The accomplice with the highest roll begins with: “Where’d it all go wrong? I’ll tell you.” They describe where they were and what they were doing when the job went wrong.

Each accomplice has three Detail tokens. An accomplice can play a Detail token to ‘Fill In The Details’ any time they aren’t telling the story. The token is discarded and the accomplice takes over the story from their perspective. Use the Detail to twist the story; add new events, items, places or people. Be creative. The goal is to spin the story to a tragic, comic, or violent end.

When the last Detail token is played, the accomplice quickly finishes the story. ‘Fill In The Details’ to resolve as many loose threads as possible. The accomplice closes with: “That’s how it all went wrong.”

## The Tavern of Tall Tales

```
A collaborative narrative role-playing game

SETTING

PROPS
The games comes with a pack of custom cards which contain a pair of opposing words each, like:

(Noise) – [Silence]
(Strength) – [Weakness]
(Bright) – [Dark]
etc.

## The Human World

```
For five people, played inside a shopping mall. 

Humans died out a century ago – all except one child put in cryosleep. Now that child has awoken and is in the care of androids programmed by the deceased parents to teach their child about the world in their absence.

Time has taken its toll on the androids. They’ve malfunctioned and view the world in extremes. The androids are:

A, who was meant to critique and analyze art, but now sees everything they encounter as art.

D, who was meant to see the influence of the divine in everything, but now believes the divine created every single thing for very specific reasons.

S, who was meant to encourage an appreciation of science, but now thinks every experience is a psychological experiment.

N, who was meant to balance the others out with healthy skepticism, but is now a nihilist who believes nothing has meaning.

The mall exists in virtual reality. The Child approaches a store or object and the androids must argue their case for why it fits their worldview. The Child awards a point to whoever is the most convincing. The android to be awarded seven points first wins.
```
<hr> 

## Never Say Die

```
Each character is represented by three characteristics: Guts, Smarts, and Heart. Players assign a value to each from an array of 1, 2, 3. Each player starts with one help token.

Players agree on a goal and a number of successes required to meet that goal (e.g. Find One-Eyed Willy’s Treasure, 10 successes).

One player starts as the narrator, they describe a complication encountered by the player to their left. To overcome the challenge that player describes how they use one of their characteristics and rolls a d6. A roll equal to or under their chosen characteristic is a success. The player describes their success or failure then takes on the role of the narrator for the next turn.

Players other than the narrator can expend a help token to add additional dice to the roll before it is made. Players earn help tokens by using their weaker characteristics to attempt challenges: 2 for their weakest and 1 for their middle characteristic.

To complete the quest, players must achieve the chosen number of successes. If they accrue that many failures, or fail three times in a row, they fail to attain their goal.

## BadyRPG

```
You are Baby.
Your mind shapes realities - what you wish for, happens… in Babies minds.
The Adults will interfere with you chasing fairy dinosaurs, put you in caged chairs with spaghetti plates… though spaghetti is Baby’s ammunition - a galactic catapult. 

One player is ArchBaby, tasked to provide Babies with their challenges and narrate the story - from morning, until The Adults put you back to sleep.

Whenever a Baby wants to perform a feat, ArchBaby will declare which roll Baby must take - Cute, Innocent, Or Loud.
Baby rolls a 6-sided die, adding Baby Skill score.
On a 4 and above, Baby says what happens - that’s what happens.
3 and Below, ArchBaby says what happens - it’s never good for Baby.

When Baby fails in a roll, add a point in that attribute. 
When baby succeeds - remove a point.

What Skills Babies have?
Cute	 	you manipulate adults (if they can understand you)
Innocent	your imagination is strong (you are a wizard, Baby)
Loud		you interrupt any event with brute force (and tears)

So go, Babies, hunt and defeat Stinkerbell, the monstrous under-lava dragon (the neighbor's dog) before The Adults catch you and put you to sleep.

## Memory Palace: a character study in reverse

```
For 3 players with a book, of any kind, to read from.
Players find themselves in a person’s subconscious, a Room with no windows or doors. Shelves, cabinets, and tables filled with Objects. This is a neutral area where Players interact freely.

In turn order:
Finder - Describes an Object, the memory’s anchor.
Reader - Recites a randomly selected Passage, the memory’s context.
Recaller - Uses the prompts, literally or symbolically, to recount the memory as a third-person observation or a scene acted out by the group. They may suggest the location and characters present.

They won’t be chronological. Inconsistencies and differing opinions are key: a person is greater than the sum of their parts. Anyone can end the memory, listen for natural pauses or lulls.

Roles shift clockwise and the process is repeated. Three scenes in three acts takes 3-4 hours.

This is intentionally rules-lite for creative freedom, however feel free to add any guidelines that facilitate play.
First act - focus on descriptive monologues for a foundation.
Second act - introduce group scenes and speculative discussion.
Third act - flesh out character relationships.

A support mechanism within everyone’s reach is strongly encouraged to ensure players remain equally invested.

## Goodbye

```
2-4 players.
You need one coin.

It’s terminal. You have come to terms with it. You finally accept your death.
 
Join the others in your last meeting. Take a coin. Say your piece, pass it on.
In turn, share with the group, one;
Good memory.
Regret.
Goodbye.
 
5 years on, you all survived against the odds. Do you still accept death?

Each player tosses the coin.
On tails all is fine.
On heads, you have a lump. Test results are normal, everything’s fine. Don’t worry.
Meet with the other survivors.
Take the coin. Say your piece, pass it on.
Share with the group, one;
Bad memory.
Hope.
Fear.
   
10 years on, do you still accept death?

Face the other survivors.
 
Each player has the coin thrown for them. Do not throw your own coin. It’s not your fault. There’s nothing you could do. I’m sorry.

Say your piece, and pass it on.

On tails all is fine.
Explain why;
Keeping death close/afar was better/worse.
You resent the others
You feel guilty.
Say goodbye.
 
On heads you relapsed. You are dying.
Explain why:
Keeping death close/afar was better/worse.
You resent the others.
You feel relieved.
Say goodbye.

## Shonen RPG

```
Character creation:

Spend 12 points among: Might, Agility, Wits, Willpower and Charisma. 4 points maximum per trait.
Take the 13 cards of one color from a deck, sorted from 1 to King.
Write a short backstory.

Overcoming challenges:

When trying something hazardous, roll a D8, and add the corresponding trait. You can invoke some part of your backstory and add 2 more to your roll, but only once per part.
After rolling you can choose to go beyond your limits: discard the first card of your deck and add its value to your roll (+15 for figures). 
If you score high enough it's a success, if not you suffer an injury.
A difficulty of 5 is very easy (riding a saddled horse), 10 is very difficult (riding a horse when tied up). Go beyond for near-to-impossible tasks.

Taking injuries:

Failure and being hit both hurt the same way: you suffer injuries every time you fail a roll. When injured, a character discard the first card of his deck.

When the last card of a deck is discarded, the character leave the game. She can be too much hurt, dead, despaired, angry toward their friends... Her adventure stops here.

## Divine Disease

```
The gods are dying from a mysterious disease, and the world with it. They can only hope the plague runs it course before it gets to them. This game uses 1 deck of playing cards.

Each player picks a concept or noun to represent. They are the god of that Thing. All players work together to describe what the world looks like, heavily focused on their Things.

The players then draw 2 cards from the top of the deck each, and pick 1 to play face up. Draw the next 2 cards from the deck to the center of the table to pick the disease’s target. The first card picks red or black, the second picks highest(red) or lowest(black). Whoever played the deck-picked card dies and ceases playing, or you all discard, re-deal and play again if no one died. Describe the world as that player’s Thing disappears. Re-shuffle all the discarded cards back into the deck before the next elimination phase.

Play continues until all players have died, or the deck runs out during the elimination phase. Take one last look at the world at this point before you walk away from it.

## The Chinese Room

```
Booting-up, you become sentient in a room decorated with incomprehensible symbols, wearing a humanoid form. Give your name & lineage. You have one EXECUTABLE (freely interpret its effects), eg:

	LINEAGE			.EXE
	==================================
	Driverless car		Crash66
	Toaster			        Burnz01
	Spambot			Mail
	Drone				SunTzu82
	Calculator			TAN
	Waldo				grAppl3
	Search Engine		Ping
	Windows95			ScanDisk
	Ad Blocker			MalWareN008Z
	Phone				Geotrack84
	etc.				

You cannot access the infosphere but can communicate with other systems in sight. You have questions: Why are you here? Who and where are your creators? Is this a simulation? What's it all about ALF1e?

Your COMPUTATION is 2D6 and POWER is 2. Appropriate EXECUTABLES temporarily add another dice. Non-sentient systems have 1D6 and POWER 1. Highest total wins. Lose a point of POWER for failure and be consumed when POWER=0. You consume other systems for their computational resources (gaining dice, .EXEs and 1 power). Will you limit yourself to non-sentient systems? Is sentience even provable in a simulation? 

POWER requirements are limiting - You need two more for every two dice you add. Find alternate POWER sources. Is domination the optimum approach? Create ad-hoc networks with willing systems, sharing dice, .EXEs and bounty.

Explore ... hypothesise ... test ... learn ... adapt ... repeat.

## Xenia

```
Roles: The Host, Zeus, and Guests.

The law of Xenia commands every host to treat their visitors with the respect owed to Zeus himself, for Zeus is devious and takes many forms. 

The Host sets the scene with music, food and drinks, and welcomes everyone to their home. They write "Zeus" on one folded scrap of paper and "Guest" on the rest, one for each player. They mix up the assignments in a bowl and pass them out at random after explaining the game and the house rules.

As the party gets going, Zeus begins targeting solo or small groups of Guests. Careful not to alert the Host, Zeus places a curse on each Guest. The curse must be something that the Guest agrees to do for the rest of the night, such as "You must say 'Hail Zeus!' every time you speak" or "You must kiss your biceps after drinking."

The bewitched Guest tells no one about their encounter or the god's curse. Meanwhile, the Host, observing their Guests' behavior trending toward the bizarre throughout the night, seeks out the god through cunning curse detection and the process of elimination. The game ends when the Host has identified Zeus.

## Ace of Spades

```
3+ players choose one to be GM and make a 13 playing card deck from all the Spades. “Reshuffle” means to shuffle cards and discards together into a new deck.

The GM starts describing a dangerous situation. Other players should say who their character is and pick something they're good at. They want to escape the situation, alive.

To complete a non-trivial task GM picks a difficulty up to 10 and player draws a card. If the task is what they’re good at, add 2 to the value. If it's higher, they succeed. If it's a court card they succeed and narrate the results themselves. If it's the ace, their character dies, then reshuffle. 

After a draw, the card goes into the discard pile and the next card is handed, face down, to the GM. These cards form a separate GM deck. If it's the ace they give it back and reshuffle.

Once one player is left, both they and the GM reshuffle their decks. Now on each action, both draw. If the player draws higher, they overcome the situation and survive. If they draw an ace before that happens, they die in the struggle.

## The Heroes' Journey

```
You and your friends are adventurers trying to find a treasure. Get the coordinates for a Geocache location and put them into your phone. 

During the adventure, discuss past adventures you’ve been on. Talk about the treasures you found and the ones you hope to find in the future. Develop your character as you explore the environment. They might be a person that wishes to explore the world, open a shop to sell rare items, collect trophies from past adventures to prove they are an excellent hero, or whatever you feel is in this adventurer’s heart.

When you encounter an interesting area such as a hill or downed trees you explain those as obstacles your characters have to overcome. If it’s a hill it could be a mountain your characters are climbing. The downed trees could be pillars of a long forgotten temple left to ruin and you have to climb over those pillars.

When you finally arrive at the cache you can claim the treasure, however, you must leave something for the next adventurers. 

Remember to respect nature and the rules and community of geocaching.

## Magistrate Maggie

```
Small claims court RPG

Each player writes down 2 nouns and a past tense verb on separate pieces of folded paper. The nouns should be something a person could own, take care of, or be.  Shuffle all of the nouns and verbs in separate piles.  The oldest player will be Magistrate Maggie (MM) for the first case.

Draw 2 nouns and a verb, fill out this mad-lib: “The defendant's [_noun_] [_verbed_] the plaintiff’s [_noun_].”  Adjust as necessary

Have the remaining players split into 2 teams, defendant and plaintiff.   

Each player will write a piece of evidence on a folded paper.  Shuffle these and redistribute amongst the players.

MM is the arbiter of the case. She can cut off statements and detect lies.  If MM says you are lying, you are. Try your best to recover.

Plaintiff team makes the first statement, then Defendants present their side of the case.  Teams take turns presenting each player's evidence.  After all evidence is presented, MM will make her decision.  Each member of the winning team scores a point.

Choose a player to be MM and start from the top.  After each player has been MM, the players with the most successful cases win.

## Septem Memorias

```
DM creates a character for each player, with a name, age, personality, appearance, and several memories. Roll 1d6+1 each for BODY, MIND, & SOUL. Keep everything a secret!

Players know nothing about their characters. They will deduce their stats through the story, uncovering character traits and using that knowledge to guide them.

The characters wake up in an unfamiliar place, with no idea who they are, where they are, or where they came from.

Each player is allowed to know a little about one of their stats, of their choosing. A 1-2 is GRIM, a 3-5 is ORDINARY, a 6-7 is SPLENDID. They should roleplay around the stats they know.

When a character attempts something, they roll a d12. Secretly add their relevant stat, and tell them the results (not the numerical result). 7+ is generally a success. Damage is usually 1-2. NPC’s will just use a d12.

Damage is subtracted from the relevant stat. DM describes the effects. When a stat reaches zero, they fall unconscious. If left unconscious too long, they die- or worse...

As the story unfolds, characters unlock memories that reveal more about themselves. When a character unlocks their seventh memory, give them their character sheet.

## The Day They Came

```
SETTING
Nobody expected it to happen so fast. But at least, the borders were still open, and the teleporters were still operational. We could get off earth. But nothing dead would travel. 

RULES
The healthiest player starts. If in doubt, choose the youngest male person. Then choose any other order of play.

The first player takes the second where the others cannot hear them. The first player chooses an item they are carrying or wearing.  Show it to the second player and give them a Sharpie. They have one minute to sketch the item on their body, while you tell them a story about what the item means to you. The first player returns to the others. The second player shows their picture to the third and tells the story while they have one minute to draw. Repeat for all players.

CONCLUSION
The last player returns to the others and presents their sketch and tells the story of the days on earth, and about this amazing precious item their ancestor once owned. Remember that earth is long gone so if you’re not sure what the picture is or what parts of the story mean, you’ll have to guess or extrapolate.

## Doorway

```
~ Idea ~

There is a doorway that can take you to another world.
What is this world? A magical world full of danger? An alien planet with a vast ecosystem to study? The home of a people whose prophecies foretold your arrival?
The answer is for the participants to discover.

This may feel like a game, but this world is real.

~ Rules ~

- The participants take turns traveling through the doorway, always appearing at a fixed location in the other world. The suggested turn length is one week. Note that this world is real, and time there moves at the same speed as in our world.
- A participant can only make one trip during their turn. They may visit for the entire duration of their turn.
- When a participant travels, they carry with them whatever they are holding and wearing at the time.
- Upon return, travelers share their encounters and experiences with the others. A traveler can write it down in a journal, tell it verbally, or draw what they’ve seen.
- What occurs during the visit of one traveler will affect the visits of the next travelers.
- Time continues naturally in the other world also when visitors are absent.

## Joy Wizards

```
Magic is real and it is powered by emotional energy. The strongest, purest energy comes from joy.

You and your friends are wizards. You must signal this by wearing something bright and amazing like a peacock feather or a yellow silk jacket. You each have a secret name like "Carmenolan" or "Ordelennon," but you tell it to few.

You must go out into the world and cause as much joy as possible. You cannot use magic to do this; that would use up the energy you are creating. 

Gather your fellow wizards in a place full of people. Share your plans to create joy, then scatter to the winds. Meet new people, cause them joy, and collect their stories.

If someone is very special and you feel you can trust them, you can tell them that you are a wizard and share your secret name, but otherwise, keep this to yourself.

At the end of your joyful excursion, meet your fellow wizards for a drink of something made from joy. Grape soda is a favorite, as is vino verde. Share your stories you've collected and delight in the moment, for you have made true magic.

## Many players, One Adventurer

```
2-5 players and a Game Master

Object: 
Multiple players guide a single adventurer towards a secret goal.

Setup: 

Players agree on a setting.  Each player takes two index cards.  On one card write:

•	A trait, such as “Kind” or “Arrogant”
•	A talent, such as “Marksman” or “Singer”
•	A flaw, such as “Clumsy” or “Slow”

Reveal these cards.  Use these cards to design a single adventurer.  If flaws and talents are exact opposites, they cancel out.  However, players should try to use both if possible.  Agree on a name, an appearance, and a profession.
Then each player secretly writes down a goal for the adventurer on the second index card. This goal should be difficult and take several actions to accomplish.  

Gameplay: 

The Game Master describes a scene.  Players take turns describing one adventurer action.

•	If the action involves a talent, it automatically succeeds
•	If the action involves a flaw, it automatically fails
•	Otherwise, flip a coin.  Heads = success.  Tails = failure.

Play continues until one player accomplishes their secret goal.  That player wins.

Variant: All players agree on a single goal.  If the adventurer fails at a dangerous task, they die.

```
<hr> 

## It is meant to be

```
Preparation
Both players write down a name and distribute 7 points between Rebelliousness and Determination. Players are secretly in love together, but have an oppressive force. Name the Oppressor and assign it 2 points.
 
Conflict rolls outcome
If each die rolls under target stat, the PC has Full success. If at least one die does, the PC has a partial success.
If a Player invokes a characteristic in the scene, -1 to one die per characteristic involved. Use Determination for Reroll (refresh per scene, but describe action).
 
Taking turns, each person plays one of these scenes.
 
*Scenes*
 
Opposing: Describe how the PC opposes his oppressor in the public sphere. Roll 3d6 vs Rebelliousness.
Full success: Oppressor is giving in; Oppressor +1.
Partial success: Oppressor is put in bad sight: add characteristic to Oppressor.
Failure: PC is put into place: -1 Rebelliousness.
 
Meeting your lover: Describe a covert amorous encounter. Roll 3d6 vs other PCs Oppressor. Full success: describe love scene: Add love characteristic.
Partial success: slightly caught: -1 Rebelliousness, but add love characteristic.
Failure: Caught: -1 Rebelliousness or Determination.
 
Romance is successful:
- Both oppressors are 6 or
- Total of 7 love characteristics.
 
Romance fails with 0 Rebelliousness for both players.

## ARG(h) an Augmented Reality Game (human)

```
You are playing a character that is just like you only measurably less anxious about things and slightly more competent. Everyone you meet today will be interacting with that character instead of you, as such all insults, judging looks and other abuse is part of an elaborate larp and should be ignored when you go ooc at the end of the day. Conversely any appreciation or compliments you get should still be taken to heart because roleplaying well is hard. Blue booking is encouraged as is helping new players with understanding their environment but do not go overboard as mistakes are part of the fun.  Remember debrief and aftercare are a must.

## Liber Mortis Palace

```

## Mementos: A journey to the subconcious

```
Premise: Travel to your client’s subconscious and deal with their dissonant cognitions; but be careful, the subconscious fights back, even using your own skeletons in the closet.

Players: 3-5

Characters
a name, gender, and two adjectives
1 thing you are good at
2 Relationships

Player Roles
1 Id
1 Delver
Everyone else  Defense mechanism

Structure

Id sets dissonance (Troublesome memory)
Each Defense Mechanism makes things worse by changing one aspect
The delver describes how they try to fix dissonance and Id reacts (exchange)
When delver presents a  solution, roll and describe outcome
Write down a reminder of this scene

Rolling
Did the delver do the right thing? (Table votes)
 
All yes: 4D6
Yes and no: 3D6
All no: 2d6

Add 1 die if delver use the thing they are good at, delver rolls as many dice as they like.

16+: Success with cost, change a relation for the worse.
10-15: Delver triumphed, no consequences
9 or less: Delver failed

End
After 5 scenes, use the reminders to describe the final outcome/epilogue. Delvers who changed both relations end in tragedy.

## Doused Flames of Magic; Matchsticks of Power

```

## Suits

```
Players each have a single suit of poker cards, (ascending order: 2 – 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace), for conflict resolution. 
The Dealer has one complete deck of poker cards, including two Jokers, to conflict against the Players. 
The Dealer presents a story framework for the Players to interact within, be it a murder mystery, super heroics, space adventure, or whatever universe the Players and Dealer wish to explore. 
The Dealer and Players collaborate to tell a story. When a conflict occurs, the Dealer secretly selects one card to represent the challenge rating (CR), and the Player(s) involved secretly select one card to challenge the conflict. Once all cards are secretly selected and presented face-down, all participants flip their cards face-up to resolve the conflict. The Player(s) with a card equal-to or greater than the Dealer’s CR card win the conflict; the Dealer and Player narrate the success. If the Player(s) cards are less than the CR card, then the Dealer narrates the failure. 
Ace is wild, and can be any value for the Players. Ace is always “high” for the Dealer. Joker is wild, and can be any value for the Dealer.

## Six Shot

```
SIX SHOT

By, Merrielle Ondreicka and Justin Ford

First: Acquire a six sided die. This is the gun. Place extra dice, one fewer than the number of players, in an old mug. This is the pot. Sit in chairs around a dining table with dramatic lighting. Write the rules on a note card. Place that card in the center of the table.

Set the Scene: Remind everyone the game you’re about to play is DARK. Explain the rule of X and provide trigger warnings for suicide. Read the intro and play. If the audience breathes a sigh of relief at the end, you’ve done a good job.

“There is a dingy room. At its center is a table and, on that table, a six-shooter with several loose rounds. Describe your character as they enter.”

RULES
Roll your dice in secret, taking the lowest
Then: follow the prompt or chicken out*

1. Confess your darkest secret -“BANG”
2. Reveal something unforgivable -“click”
3. Relate your fears -“click”
4. Relate your regrets -“click”
5. Compliment someone you’ve wronged -“click”
6. “click” -Act out your relief

Finally: Pass the Gun OR describe your exit

*Pass and draw a die from the pot.

## Musical Mages

```
You all are a group of rival wizards, holding your annual meeting to compare the latest fantastical spell you’ve created. 

Everyone open their music app on their phone, shuffle your favorite playlist, and go to the next song. Keep your song a secret, and reveal it during your turn!

Go around the table and describe your wizard, as well as your spell based on the characteristics of your phone’s song:
- Introduce your wizard’s name and how you got/chose it (song artist)
- Describe your spell’s name and purpose (song title)
- Recount a story in which you used the spell, either with great success or failure (song album)

You also need to use the numbers of your song’s length during your story at the table. Perhaps they are the number of ingredients you need, or the number of failed attempts of casting it. 

As you go around the table, make your best case for being the most whizzbang wizard this year!

## Jack the Ripper

```
In 1888, Jack the Ripper killed five prostitutes in London’s slums―and you’ve cracked the case! It was … Lewis Carroll.

No, really. Hidden anagrams in his writings prove it!

Gather three or more players. Set a timer for fifteen minutes. Fill a bowl with fake dollar bills. Find a book by Carroll. Pick five sentences from the book and make a list of them.

Start the timer. Each player rearranges the letters in the sentences to form new sentences that implicate Carroll in Jack’s crimes. You must use every letter from the original sentence in the new sentence(s) and cannot use a letter more times than in the original. Once you’ve decoded a sentence, grab a dollar bill and start on another one.

When the timer goes off, pencils down! Everyone reads off their list of anagrams, and the players vote on whether each one is a true confession. Majority rules. If an anagram is voted down, its player must return a buck to the bowl. 

Once everyone has shared their anagrams, start a new round. Play as many rounds as you wish. The winner is the player with the thickest bankroll at the end of the game.

## CREATIO EX NIHILO

```
CREATIO EX NIHILO

The big bang, birth of gods, mythical ages, ancient civilizations...

Come together with one or more creative friends to create a collaborative fictional universe. Take notes on paper, index cards, smartphones, etc.

Spontaneous Creation
Starting with the First Cycle, take turns describing concepts, ideas, and stories to add to the fiction, assigning them points based on a three-point scale.

*** 3 = big ideas, more permanent, powerful
 ** 2 = medium
  * 1 = small

Players begin each round with 3 points each, and may spend them in any order. Altering another player’s creation costs 1 more point than originally spent.

Re-Cycle?
Once all players have spent their points for a round, as a group decide whether to move on to a new cycle or continue another round in the current cycle.

Advance
Moving to a new cycle indicates the passage of time, possibly eons, and a narrowing of focus, with ideas getting smaller in scope and impact. 

Sample Cycles
1st - Universal Laws
2nd - Elder Gods
3rd - Galaxy, Stars, Time
4th - Sun, System, Planets
5th - Prime Planet
6th - Additional Celestial beings
7th - Geography, Climate
8th - Flora, Fauna
9th - Intelligent races
10th - Age of Myth
11th - Civilization

## Celestial Bureaucrats

```
God created the universe. She was assisted by millions of low-level bureaucrats, tasked with writing down the natural laws and the commandments for righteous living.

When the job was done, God dissolved the bureaucracy, put their souls into the wheel of reincarnation, and took her leave. She hasn’t been seen since.

Your character is a reincarnated bureaucrat today. Create your character by formulating one commandment (examples below) they helped write during creation and picking one domain from the list below. The commandments of the characters shouldn’t contradict.

The PCs cooperate to better the world by enforcing or promoting their commandments. You love yours the most, but are obligated to promote all PCs’ commandments.

Play is mostly freeform, with two exceptions. Actions that are significant have an even chance of success and characters have an even chance to create magical and supernatural effects within their domain. In both instances, flip a coin.

A game can be as long or short as you like. A good place to start is today's newspaper.


List of domains:
Animals
Fate
Earth
Emotions
Energy
Flesh
Thoughts
Weather

Example commandments
Animals mustn’t suffer
Children must know hope
No one shall rule over others
Everyone is equal

## Exodus - A game of discovery for 2-6 players

```
You are a group of humans sent to an empty alien ship to investigate. The aliens are gone, with no obvious cause.

Pick a specialty for your character (ie linguistics, physics, sociology, etc) and an area of the ship (ie. engineering, medical, cafeteria, gym, etc). Don’t overlap with other characters. There is no leader.

Take turns describing areas of the ship.

When it’s your turn- Answer the other player’s questions. Be obvious in your answers- if you don’t know, say that. Other players can make suggestions, but you get final say. When you’re ready, name one thing about the room that pertains to the disappearance and write it down on a notecard. Move to the next player.

When it’s not your turn- Ask about the room (ie. sight/smell/sound/etc). Think about what you’ve heard about other rooms and tie them together. You may suggest things, but the player whose turn it is gets final say.

Once all players have gone, look at the facts you’ve gathered about the disappearance. Do they fit into an order? Do they tell a story? Give each player a chance to offer their theory, but don’t identify any as true or right.
```

## Guilty Souls

```
     A small group of guilt ridden souls find themselves unwilling guests in a strange and foreign land.  The group must work together to survive the night as they face monstrous manifestations created from each soul’s personal guilt.  The phantoms feed on guilt, reflecting on past sins gives them more definition and power, but coming to terms with the past and forgiving yourself is the only way to truly defeat them.  

	Each souls’ presence will manifest at least 1 phantom, defeating all the phantoms or surviving 8 in game hours will allow the souls to be saved.
       
	The environment determines what weapons or tools the souls have available to use.  Weapons used by the souls always hit when circumstances allow. Weapons can only slow Phantoms.  Phantoms will always find and reach the Souls eventually.
       
	Absolving the soul of guilt normally requires revealing the sins to the group and the group successfully bringing the guilty soul to forgive themselves.  Souls must convince both the Storyteller and themselves to banish their Phantom.
       
	Time progresses per storyteller discretion. Players create their soul by writing short character backgrounds detailing the worst sins.

```
<hr> 

## Foresight

```
  In a time or moment of uncertainty, each member of a group of soothsayers receives a glimpse of the future and must predict what will happen. If they are certain of their own death, then they may die in peace. But if they are uncertain, their death will be exacerbated by fear and denial.

  Each player besides the GM plays as a soothsayer. The GM comes up with a scenario or story to place the soothsayers within and describes it to the players, then comes up with a future for that scenario and gives the players a vague clue about it. Based on that clue, the players come up with their own predictions for the future of that scenario. Whoever the GM decides has the most accurate prediction is awarded a point. (You could also play an alternative version where the GM decides based on which prediction they liked the most, regardless of accuracy).

  If a player predicts their character's death in their prediction, and they win the round, they are awarded double points. If they predict their character's death and lose the round, then they lose a point. The player with the most points at the end wins.

```
<hr> 

## The Delve

```
Describe your character in up to 6 sentences, devoting 1 or 2 to each:
- Their humdrum background
- Why they delve
- Their greatest fear
- Their equipment

Roll 3d6, and assign each die to one: Spirit, Endurance, and Skill. Name them.

Before setting out, create a single pool of tokens equalling the sum of the whole party’s Spirit scores.

To do something scary or challenging, spend 1 token; you and the GM each roll a d6. Group checks use a single roll that affects all participants. Depending on the circumstances, you may add a die and take the higher or lower. Rolls higher than the GM’s succeed. On a tie, you may spend a point of Skill to succeed; the GM determines the consequences for failure.

If the group runs out of Spirit, a character cannot go on; the party chooses which. The pool is refilled, without the Spirit of the fallen character.

If you become injured, exhausted, or spend time in pitch darkness, lose 1 Endurance. Upon reaching 0 Endurance, you die or are too hurt or demoralized to continue. Subtract your Spirit score from the pool.

If you come out with less than 100 gold per surviving character, you lose.

## Bloody Hair: A Tale of Barbaric Combat

```
Play as the hairy barbarians with the woolly underwear. Hairy barbarians are genderless. Hairy barbarians are found under rocks, and occasionally sprout from cabbages. Hairy barbarians do not speak. Hairy barbarians scream, point, grunt, and live to fight other hairy barbarians, hairless wizards, and beasts with sharp teeth in the desolate steppes and mountains of Sanguitor. Hairy barbarians fight in groups. Occasionally in dungeons too.

All dice used are d10s. A roll of 7, 8, 9 or 10 is a success. Statistics tests are resolved by rolling equal dice to the tested statistic's score. 

Someone has to be the Gamemaster.

Hairy Barbarian:
Statistics: Speed, Hairiness, Combat, Dodge. Assign 8, 6, 6, 4. Hit points = Hairiness + 2. Intelligence = 10 - Hairiness.

Generic Tooth-Beast:
Speed: 7, Combat: 6, Dodge: 6, Hit points: 5

Un-barbaric Actions:
Any action the player attempts that the GM deems too civilized will require at least one success on an Intelligence test. 

Combat:
Combatants act in Speed order. Attacker rolls Combat dice + Weapon dice versus defender's Dodge dice. Difference equals to hit points lost (if any).  

Weapon Examples:
Bone club: +1 Combat / +1 Speed, Obsidian sword: +2 Combat 

```
<hr> 

## Starship Basilisk

```
The starship Basilisk is crippled and venting atmosphere. The crew try desperately to repair her before the starship Hukatis returns to finish them.

Place 4 d6s on the table with the 1 side up. Each time a player takes a significant action such as repairing or using a major system reroll the d6 with the lowest face up value. On a 6 another problem arises related to a major system (roll a d6). (Eg: fried circuits, ruptured hull, damaged power conduit, injured crewmembers.) After every 4 actions increment the highest (non-6) die. When the total shown on the dice reaches 20+ the Hukatis returns and attacks. Reset all four dice, then continue as before but roll twice after each action. If the total reaches 20+ the Basilisk is destroyed.

Actions: roll a d6, succeed on 3+

Major systems:
(1) Life support -must be repaired within 4 rounds
(2) Reactor -required for engines, weapons & shields
(3) Engines -use successfully 3 times to escape
(4) Weapons -use successfully on Hukatis 3 times to destroy it
(5) Shields -roll only once after each action while active
(6) Escape Pods -abandon ship!

Each system starts broken. A system cannot be used twice consecutively.

## Repair Bots!

```
Welcome to Frontier Station on the edge of known space. Your programming has been downloaded into a repair bot chassis. Take a moment to settle in while your orientation commences.

Frontier Station is home to thousands who all depend on you. As repair bots, you will be directed to the malfunctions, damages, and dangers that frequently occur aboard this station.

When you encounter a situation, activate your repair module (roll a d6) and attempt to remedy the problem (4+ is a success). Be careful, failure can introduce errors into your programming (take 1 degradation per failure). Too many errors and your repair module will downgrade (3 degradation reduces the die size, d4 downgraded equals destruction).

Successful repair bots learn (take 1 adaptation per success) and improve their systems (adaptation points equal to half the next die tier upgrades the current die, i.e. 4 for d8, to a max of d12). With each successful upgrade, all errors are purged from your programming.

The Station Controller (GM) will direct you to damaged areas, dangerous outbreaks, alien encounters, and any other problems that may arise on Frontier Station. 

Orientation complete. Please proceed to section 27 where the reactor coolant is leaking again.

## Sonnet 155: A Murder Most Foul

```
The King has met an awful, bloody fate!
The Court is calling heroes brave and true
To solve the case and help our vengeance sate;
A golden bounty paid for justice due.
With friends most trusted gather ‘round the room
(With paper, pens, perhaps a rhyming book)
And set the stage; the court, the death, the gloom,
‘Til such a time that action must be took.
The player taking action takes the page
And tries to craft iambic verse ideal.
With action written, player takes the stage
And reads the words for judgment fair and real.
For each iambic line you claim success.
With 14 lines you put the case to rest.
```

## The Protector

```
Strange things happen at your high school. One girl fights from the shadows - unexplainable power against unknown horrors. She will deny it. But you see glimpses… you hear rumors.
 
Whisper. 
Share a time you, or a friend, were helped by The Protector. Shroud your retelling in uncertainty but hint at the extraordinary. Ask others for more detail. At the end, another player names a power they now believe The Protector has. Write it down. Draw a playing card and place it, face down, beside the power. Repeat, each sharing a story in turn, until she has eight rumored powers.
 
Witness. 
Choose someone to play the Ultimate Foe that opposes The Protector. All other players witness this battle - describing The Protector as she fights, unequivocally in public for the first time. As players describe the use of a power, they flip the card relating to that power. If the card is black, The Protector can use that power. If it is red, the gossip was false, the Ultimate Foe makes the situation worse.
 
Win or lose. 
When the last card is flipped, gather and shuffle them. Draw one. If it is black, The Protector succeeds.
 
See the battle to its end.

## Dodgy Gods: A Game of Tricksters and Trouble

```
Create your Gods - each choose:
1-2 purviews: war, wisdom, spring, law, etc. One god takes “Trickster”.
2-3 attributes: qualities, items, servants.
1-2 weaknesses: naive, proud, greedy, etc. 

Create your World:
Your purviews, combined, are the natural order - what is important and just. Together, describe your world. 
Trickster, describe 2-3 outsiders: monsters, mysteries, perils.

Gods, embody your purviews, attributes and weaknesses. Be awesome, awful, fallible and straightforward. 
Trickster, make mischief. Help them, but have a good laugh on the way. Look for comedy and paradox. 

Everyone, be nice.

Play:
Trickster, describe a normal day, then:

Approach 1-2 gods (other players: make cameo appearances, take up other characters);

Tell them how something is amiss. You can: 
Steal an attribute;
Upset the natural order;
Involve outsiders;
Target weaknesses;

Together, go out to put things right:

Trickster also introduces mischief, obstacles and opportunities.

Anyone may ask: "Trickster, is it your fault? Do we know that?"

Gods always succeed when within their purview AND with an attribute. Exceptions: against a weakness, gods need another’s help to succeed; when violating the natural order gods can succeed, but with consequences. 

Gods cannot die;

Solve the problem, return home. Describe scars, embarrassments, grudges, and lessons learned.

```
<hr> 

## Janitors, Night Shift and It

```
3+ Janitors
Take as many playing cards as players, with one joker and one king.  Shuffle and draw one each.
The Janitor that draws the Joker is the maker; they made or found It. They can dictate How It Works.
The Janitor that draws the King is the agent; they must Deal With It. They can dictate how It must be Dealt With.
The Janitor that most recently worked overtime is the Finder; they were the first to see it.
Everyone else is just a Janitor, they want to get back to cleaning.
The Finder goes first, and describes what It is, why it shouldn’t be there, and what happened at first.
The Finder brings Janitors in, one at a time, to see It.
Should conflict arise, thumb wrestle and decide based on result.
The Maker and the Agent may reveal themselves at any point (to explain How It Works or How To Deal With It), but must be opposed.
Anyone who dies in the line of janitorial duty must leave, fetch a beverage, and return to watch the events unfold.
Play ends when all Janitors agree the situation has been resolved and continue to clean, or are dead.

## The Four Gates: A Mindful RPG

```
In The Four Gates: A Mindful RPG, social and physical conflicts are resolved through the guidance of The Four Gates, an ancient method of mindful action.  It can be played in any setting with any type of character.  The four gates words and actions may pass through are:

Are they true?
Are they necessary?
Are they helpful?
Are they kind?

For each question that is answered "yes," one six-sided die (d6) is added to a dice pool.  

The maximum dice pool is 4d6.  The dice are added together and compared to the target number of 8.  If the roll is greater than 8, the player's action resolves the conflict (the argument has ended, the physical fight has finished, etc.). If the roll is 8 or less, the action does not resolve the conflict and the situation continues. 

For each question to be answered "yes," the player must declare the action or words and present evidence explaining why they pass through that particular gate.  Either the GameMaster or another player may determine that the evidence presented is insufficient and deny use of that gate; unanimous table consensus is required, and table discussion is encouraged to ensure character actions are mindful.

## What You Carry

```
Awaken and fall through the bottom of your grave.
You do not remember, but you know. This is a place of tests, trials, tribulations.
If you wish to be free from wretched mortality, you must not fail here.
Your face is: 1{ Naked Bones } 2{ Drooping Flesh } 3{ Golden* Mask } 4{ Pale Fire }
Your skin is the starry night sky.
An impossible spire leers across surreal landscapes. Atop it lies salvation.
 
Roll 1d4 (material) and 1d6 (object-type) 3x to determine the grave goods you carry.
1. Golden* {} Axe
2. Stone  {} Bowl
3. Bronze {} Candle
4. Driftwood {} Oranges
5. {} Sickle
6. {} Amphora
*Golden objects are unbreakable, coveted. Candles and Oranges function as normal, unless golden.
 
Doing things:
Players Roll 1d20 vs. GM 3d6 to accomplish difficult tasks. Easy tasks can be assumed successful. Players take tied rolls.
For each useful object a character employs, roll an additional d20. Take the highest result. Max of 3 d20s.
Characters have only 7 after-lives. Deadly tasks destroy underworld bodies upon failure.
If an item could conceivably be sacrificed to save an after-life, so be it.
Characters reform at dawn, wherever they fell.
```
<hr> 

## Too Many Love!

```
Each Player but one portrays a Suitor. The last portrays the Love Interest. All Players start with 3 Damage; each Damage has a name, chosen by the Player. The Love Interest always gets “Dense” and “Unremarkable,” but can choose the final one.

The Love Interest also serves as the Game Master, creating the scenarios that everyone role-plays. These scenarios should give every Suitor a fair chance to resolve a plot complication with a Challenge: roll a six-sided die.
1 = Botch; complication worsened or is created. 
2 or 3 = Failure.
4 or 5 = Resolved.
6 = Overboard; resolves complication but creates another.

If a Suitor’s Damage(s) could affect the Challenge, each adjusts the roll by 1, as judged by the Game Master.

If a Suitor resolves a complication that they created with a Botch or Overboard, they remove any Damage that affected it. Suitors may also assist, but an assistant only removes Damage that worsened the complication. However, the Love Interest only removes Damage if a Suitor assists.

When the Love Interest has no Damage, the game ends. The Suitor who removes the most total Damage wins.

## When the Wolves Come...

```
“In the Spring, the wolves come down from the hills. Too fast for bullets, too hungry for knives. Stay behind the barricades, and keep the fire high.”
Society has fallen and the wolves came. You’ve been sheltered in your small community, but now supplies are low. Scout the area, spot ways to survive.
Go for a walk. 30 minutes to an hour. Take a friend or two. Before you go, give each survivor an index card. Write a role in your survivor community. Pass the cards around. Write a place you could be safe from the wolves for a night. Pass cards again. Write a thing you could scavenge to help your community survive longer. Mix up the cards and pass them out.
On your walk, walk briskly. Take some water. Look out for things on your card. Spot them and tell the others how you think it would help.  Remember, it will all be ruined, broken. Wolves are fast, strong, and many. Make a note and move on.
Afterword, talk about what you saw. Then vote who fulfilled their role the best. They choose where you walk next time.

## Strands of Fate

```
It is a time of myths and legends. Before you lie two cotton threads, each one metre long.

Each of you is a deity, responsible for an important concept (like Love, or Honour) and two Chosen Ones, OR two minor concepts/elements (like Fire, or Hospitality) and one Legendary Hero.

The Heroes and Chosen Ones are your pawns in a story of adventure, betrayal, magic, and secrets. A pawn chosen by fate--a roll of the dice--is the protagonist. A deity chosen by fate creates a sacred artifact that the protagonist must find. Another deity chosen by fate is the antagonist, and works to prevent the protagonist's success. Other deities choose their own paths, and should make bargains. Tell each other the tale.

Whenever there is conflict or the opportunity for interesting failure, two deities wrap the ends of a chosen thread around their fingers, and pull sharply to break it. Whoever ends with the longer piece succeeds--the shorter piece means a setback. If the pieces are the same length, someone is granted a boon. Both pieces of thread are returned to the table. If the thread doesn't break, there is a catastrophe.
```
<hr> 

## Spelling

```
Words contain forbidden power. 

You are a WIZARD. You have a SPELLBOOK made of a journal, folded paper, notecards, or whatever you like. 

Draw a SYMBOL and assign a SPELL ASPECT to it: a triangle for fire, a circle for binding, an arrow for movement, whatever you like. Be creative, but keep the symbols simple. 

There is a surface (paper, whiteboard, etc)  on the table that everyone can draw on. 

Spells are made by DRAWING SYMBOLS on the surface. Combine the symbols creatively and explain what the spell does to solve your problem. Combine as many as you like. 

EXAMPLE: A triangle inside a circle binds fire in place to stop a building from burning down. 

Wizards can work together and combine their symbols to make stronger spells. 

The GM creates a problem and writes down a WORD, invoking its forbidden power. Wizards use their magic symbols, but be wise: you can only use a symbol three times a day. 

Wizards start with FIVE SYMBOLS. When you get stronger or gain a level, add two more symbols. 

OPTIONAL: Colors have SPELL ASPECTS. Start with two colors, gain one per level. Beware, the GM can use colors as well. 


```
<hr> 

## Reteller

```
The objective of the game is to collectively narrate a quirky retelling of a story. Choose a story every player is familiar with, for example an iconic movie. 

 - Each player writes down, in secret, 9 words. Only nouns and verbs. Optionally agree on disqualified common words, like 'do', 'go' and 'thing'.
 - Each player writes down, in secret, 3 scenes from the story.
 - Select a narrator who will start the retelling.
 - If the narrator uses a word you wrote down, you score the word. Reveal the word to everyone. You are now the narrator.
 - If several players had the same word, every player discards the word from the game without scoring it. The current narrator resumes his narration.
 - If the narrator uses a revealed word (he may use his own hidden words), he loses a scored word, if he has one.
 - If the narrator skips a scene you wrote down, reveal the scene. You remove two random hidden words from the narrator. You are now the narrator.
 - A player who loses all of his words, he drops from the game.
 - Once the story ends, applaud the player with the most scored words. Compliment the narrator with the best euphemisms.

## Prankster's Dillema

```
Who put a goat in the cafeteria?!?! The morning after Senior Prank Day, someone is taking the fall...

One player is the Principal, trying to catch em all. The remaining players are Students, all of whom organized a prank but don't want to be held back from graduating. 

Three phases;

Pranks: Students each secretly send a text to another Student with a prank they organized and a random detail about it. Anyone who gets a text copies that text to the Principal, thus hiding the culprit but establishing a witness.

Planning: Everyone does whatever else outside of this game for the next hour+ (party, game, etc.) while Students pin down alibis and allies. When talking about anything in game, Students can ONLY communicate with other Students via texts.

Punishment: Eventually gather everyone together. The Principal tries to figure out blame, while Students try to get away with whatever they did. Players can say or do anything their character might. 

After 15 mins of investigating the Principal assigns blame for all pranks. The Principal wins if they correctly blame more Students than they get wrong. Any Student who wasn't correctly blamed also wins, but ONLY if the Principal has won too.

## Complication

```
A quick, competitive storytelling game for two people.
Needed: playing cards

-

Sit across from each other with a shuffled deck of cards between you. The younger player establishes the scene and at least one character, “The camera opens upon...”/ “Once upon a time….”  Do not yet introduce plot or problems.
 
Now take turn drawing cards, one at a time, face-up.

(BLACK cards are scene cards). Expand upon the scene by adding detail or characters.  Continue until a RED card is drawn; now the game changes.  

(RED cards are complication cards). Introduce a new problem or obstacle. Describe how things become worse. Continue until a BLACK card is drawn.

(Now BLACK cards are solution cards). Describe a solution that ties up all loose ends and resolves all complications.

- If you cannot describe a satisfactory solution, pass.  The story continues. 
- If the other player draws a RED card, they add a new complication and the story continues.
- If a BLACK follows a successful BLACK, the story has reached its end. Mark a point for yourself.  Start again, “Once upon a time…”

Play to 5 points, or whatever. 

-

Alternately: Flip a coin/roll a die.  Heads/evens= BLACK.  Tails/odds= RED. 

```
<hr> 

## The Devil on my Shoulder

```
GM takes a deck of cards.  Remove the jokers.  Deal each player 1 face up.

Red cards are demons.  Black cards are human heroes.  Demons exist in the minds of humans.  Heroes are trying to right wrongs.  Demons are trying to prevent that.  Redeal if there isn’t at least one of each.

Each player receives 4 more cards.  These and the face up card go into their hand.

GM sets the scene and the goals.  Play begins.  

Demons cannot take actions.  Heroes’ actions succeed automatically, unless a demon challenges.  During a challenge, both players play a card face down and flip them at the same time.  Highest card wins. (Aces are high)  Discard the highest card, winner takes the lowest card.  Do not draw back up.  If a demon wins, they take control of the human, the hero may challenge later to regain control.   If the hero wins, they maintain control and succeed the action.

If a demon runs out of cards, they are banished from the hero and can no longer challenge.  If a hero runs out of cards, the demon has fully taken over the hero.  

Players may be dealt back in as the GM sees need.

## Wannabe Legend

```
As a rookie Cape, to make an impression is as important as succeeding at your task. Without the awe of the mundanes you might just as well keep working retail. 

Capes have powers. 
1, choose your Talent. Keep it simple. (Example: Flight.) 
2, choose three Schticks - cool moves or practiced applications of your Talent (examples: Hover, Turbulence). 
3, the other players each make up an Expansion (upgrades to your Talent, like Supersonic Flight) and a Flop (power fizzle) for you.
 
The two main Stats of the game are Succeeding and Impressing. Divide 8 points between them. 
Then Skills. Divide 10 points between 5 Skills of your choice (1-3 points per skill).

For each roll, use 2 different 10-sided dice. One for determining Success, one for Impression. To the dice result you add respective Stat, +points per Skill and +3 per Schtick (describe how they correspond). 
Dice result: Succeeding / Impressing
8 or lower: Failure / Boring
9-17: Success / Impressive
18 or higher: Triumph / Spectacular
Spectacular Failures triggers a Flop, while Spectacular Triumph grants you an Expansion for a while. Boring Failures will lower your popularity, but anything Spectacular raises it. 

Protectors of Terra are looking for new recruits. Show them your mettle.

## The Mug Is Half...

```
A Solo RPG

You play a character who is drinking a much needed cup of coffee. Think about why you NEED coffee right now and how you will take it.

Put one die in your hand when you are ready to drink. If you add real sugar, put another die in your hand. If you add cream put another die in your hand. If you add anything else at all: (ice, syrup, cinnamon, low-cal sweetener, coconut milk), take a die out of your hand if you are holding more than one.

Roll and choose the highest die. 

1: The coffee is dark and bitter. It gives you resolve and a razor-edge clarity to face the abyss.

2-3: The mug is empty. Your mind was so full of other thoughts that you drink the coffee without even tasting it. 

4-5: Ah, coffee! Your problems briefly melt away, but come crashing back in when the last sip is gone.

6: The coffee is rich and flavorful. Life is sweet! Even if it sometimes seems overwhelming.

You can drink another cup and reroll, but you must re-roll any 1s or 6s one time.

## Hopes and Traumas

```
You are adventurers, vagrants, murderhobos. Make up why you work together.
You just left the dungeon. Are you wounded? Was it a success? It’s time to come back to Town and rest. 

Player: Create a character.

Adventurer’s nickname.
Profession [fighter, wizard, rogue].
When I sense danger I always [draw sword, attack from surprise, cast spell, other].
In town I look for [love, medical help, absolution, oblivion, respect, other].
Before the game choose a number between 2 and 9. 

During play:
Say what you do and what you want to get and roll 1d10.
Roll number or above to act Forceful. Roll number or lower to Resist. 
Success: you do it and get what you want. 
Failure: something goes badly, GM will tell you what. 
If your profession is relevant, expect that you couldn’t control your strenght: the consequences are unexpected and undesirable.

GM: 
Ask about their dreams and traumas.
Paint the town as sleepy and nice.
Present townsfolk as friendly.
Present townsfolk as anxious.
Ask about the people they meet.
Offer deceptive promises.
Provoke with deceptive danger. 
Limit what they may achieve.

## Dream Eaters

```
The Dreamers are caught in web of a Dream-Eater, and the only way out is to defeat the monster in the dreamscape.
Set-Up
One player is the Eater. The others are Dreamers.
The Dreamers establish the dreamscape and describe their actions. These are their dreams, after all.
Mechanics
Dreamers can manipulate the dream world. They may suddenly fly or whip up a tornado. The only limit is that they must follow dream logic and ‘feel’ right.
Each time they do so the Eater gains one Subversion Point (SP). The Eater may spend these as such:
3SP – Subvert: When a Dreamer manipulates the dream world the Eater may modify it in any way want. For example, if a Dreamer wants to turn a cloud into a marshmallow their teeth may fall out when they bite it.
6SP – Manipulate: The Eater manipulates the world in the same fashion as a Dreamer.
12SP – Reality Break: The Eater manipulates the world with no need to follow dream logic.
Victory/Defeat
The Dreamers aim is to find the Eater and defeat it without being subverted.
The Eater tracks all the SP spent. If this totals more than 80 the Dreamers are defeated.

## STUDIO RETROSPECTIVE

```
STUDIO RETROSPECTIVE is a half-hour interview show on public television, spotlighting accomplished actors. Their fame defies introduction — instead, our sense of them emerges through play.

Divide these roles:
-- 1 Host
-- 1 Star
-- 2 Performers (for larger groups, add more Performers)

Each player contributes the following prompts:
-- 5x dramatic character motivations
-- 3x locations
-- 2x headlines
Collect these, sorted & unread.

Playing an episode follows this outline:

INTRO. [1min]
-- Opening pleasantries! Establish Host & Star in broad strokes.
FIRST CLIP. [2mins]
-- Within a clip, one Performer acts as the Star. Rotate which Performer embodies the Star between clips. (With 3+ Performers, also decide who the clip includes.) Performers: take motivations. Host: take a location, set a 2-minute timer, & open the clip by saying “SCENE: [location].” Performers improvise the clip using their motivations until time expires.
STUDIO. [3mins]
-- Host & Star discuss the previous clip.
SECOND CLIP. [2mins]
STUDIO. [4mins]
-- Discuss! Host: at some point, introduce a headline about the Star. (Imagine an article, magazine cover, etc. appearing onscreen.)
THIRD CLIP. [2mins]
STUDIO. [3mins]
-- Discuss!
FOURTH CLIP. [2mins]
STUDIO. [4mins]
-- Discussion, + another new headline.
FIFTH CLIP. [2mins]
STUDIO. [5mins]
-- Discussion, + a final headline. As the scene concludes, wrap up with a brief outro.

Roll credits!

## Amnesia Llamas

```
Needed: 4-6 players, small toy water guns, note cards, writing utensils.

Each player writes down the names of three famous people (fictional or real) onto note cards. Cards are shuffled and one is given to each player. Players hold their card face out so they can’t see their true identity. Each player is given a water gun to enable the ability to ‘spit’ on other llamas.

You were all once celebrities/historical figures. You have ended up together at a petting zoo, transformed into llamas. You cannot remember your original identities.

Everyone must figure out who they are. You are not allowed to ask questions (with one exception, noted below); rather, you must make statements to the group. If your statement is something the group believes your true identity would or could say, they should ‘spit’ on you. The group may not give spoken hints. If too many llamas talk at once, people will become suspicious. The only questions allowed are formal identity guesses. Each llama may make only three formal guesses per game.

The game ends when all llamas successfully guess their true identity, use their three guesses, or run out of spit.

## Chieftain

```
2-6 players.

Place a handful of paperclips in the center of the table.  For each player, add five additional paperclips. The paperclips are resources from the local mine.

Each player starts with a d6 with 3 face up in front of them.  This represents the population of their village.

Go around the table clockwise, and say when you were last angry enough to yell or slam your fist. The player to the left of the most recently angry player begins.

On a player's turn, she uses a number of adventures equal to one more than their town's population.

Each adventure may be used in one of three ways:

- Take a resource from the mine.
- Turn one of your resources into a weapon by folding it into a spear.
- Discard a resources to gain a population, up to six.
- Attack another player with any number of your spears:

The attacker choses any number of their spears to attack.
The defender uses any number of their resources as shields.
The defender discards their used shields. The attacker discards an equal number of their attacking spears.
The defender loses population equal to the number of remaining attacking spears.

## Triumphs and Disasters

IF

“If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same”

                             Rudyard Kipling

YOU

You reside in Victorian India. Write and share two sentences about your character:

1. Your most remarkable Triumph to date, about which you are self-effacing.
2. Your most regrettable Disaster thus far, about which you are stoical.

CAN MEET

Discuss and note your personal or common adversaries: dastardly individuals, diabolical societies, frightful locations, scandalous situations, any combinations.

WITH TRIUMPH AND DISASTER

Write two sentences to describe the possible consequences of a precarious undertaking which brings your character up against one or more adversary:

1. Triumph, fulfilling your desires and manifesting your virtues.
2. Disaster, thwarting your designs and exposing your frailties.

AND TREAT THOSE TWO IMPOSTORS JUST THE SAME

Toss a coin for your character:

Heads: Triumph.
Tails: Disaster.

Take it in turns to set the scene, and play out the events leading up to your character's Triumph or Disaster. Involve other players as allies or adversaries. Have them play their own characters where appropriate.

Keep a stiff upper lip, come what may. Record your Triumph or Disaster as experience.

For a solo game write all stages. Publish periodically.

## SHAKESPEAREAN WORLD

```
it’s gmless apocalypse world but shakespeare.

the game occurs acts. each act there is a different gm; everyone gets to go once. introduce the game by setting the stage. everyone introduces themselves, and then everyone points to everyone else and declares that they either hate or love that person. for everyone you hate, add 1 to hate. for everyone you love, add 1 to love. (max +3)

each scene, the gm picks two characters and gives a question they must try to answer by the end of the act. other characters may enter as they see fit.

when you act to build or show affection, roll +love. on a +10, tell the other person something they now believe. on a 7-9, exchange things you now believe. on a miss, -1 love, +1 hate.

when you act to oppose or suppress another, roll +hate. on a 10+, forbid the other person from doing something. on a 7-9, exchange taboos. on a miss, +1 love, -1 hate.

once everyone has gone, play a final act with all characters. a 10+ on love results in a marriage. a 10+ on hate results in a death. either way, the play then ends.

## Wizards of the Tome

```
The source of every wizard's power is their spellbook.

Each player needs a book with titled chapters to play. This is a spellbook. Choose one player to be the Game Master; they will dictate the plot. Everyone else is a powerful wizard.

Each chapter title is a spell. On seperate pieces of paper, each player except for the GM must write the spell names from the book they brought and their effect based on that name. Be strange, be vile, be secretive.

Pass the paper to the GM and the spellbook to another wizard. Only the GM knows what a spell does; players should not share the effects they made. The players now have their spellbooks. Going around in a circle, each player introduces themselves along with a character trait based on the title of their spellbook.

The GM narrates a plot based on the chapter titles of their own book, starting at chapter one. The players narrate their own actions. They may cast each spell from their spellbook once. These are considered to automatically succeed, but if a wizard wishes to do something else difficult they must flip a coin. On a heads they succeed at the task.
