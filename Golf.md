## The Holy Mountain

```
You are pilgrims. You carry burdens, wear concealing clothing, and seek absolution for a transgression. You climb a mountain, visiting shrines linked by perils. 

Pilgrims must not:
Speak of life outside.
Speak of the trail ahead.
Show their face.
Invoke their ancestors.

Start at the first shrine. In turn give the shrine keeper something from your pack and say how it fulfils their requirements. Then together perform the purification ritual.

During the ritual you break one prohibition you haven't broken before:

Your life: Describe your home. Say one thing you regret leaving behind.
The trail: Warn of danger and say why you turned back last time.
Ancestors: Receive an otherworldly item, described by the others.
Your face: Reveal your transgression.

Then you leave the shrine and travel onwards. One pilgrim describes how the next peril endangers them. Another pilgrim describes a skill/tool they use to protect them, and what it implies. Repeat until you reach the next shrine.

When you reach the fifth and final shrine, you may enter or turn back. Pilgrims that enter are never seen again.

Shrines demand:
Anger
Greed
Pride
Grief

Purification through:
Sparring
Fasting
Bathing
Poisoning.

Perils:
Wildlife
Cliffs
Blizzards
Exhaustion.

<hr> 

## Moth

```
1-5 players
Approximately 12 minutes
You will need: A large piece of paper, pens, four three-minute songs

Play the first song. You start your lives as eggs.
Squeeze your body into itself as much as it physically can. Keep the piece of paper close enough so it can be reached between you and other players. Tear off a piece of the paper and write one word that expresses how you’re feeling as an egg. Fold and leave the note near where you’re positioned.

When the next song plays, crawl out of your shell as a larvae.
Stretch your body out of the position it was in as an egg. If you can, crawl around the room. Otherwise, move very slowly. Greet other larvae.

When the next song plays, solidify into a pupa.
Lay down, if you can. If not, stay very still.

When the next song plays, break out of your shells and flutter around the room as moths.
Sometimes, you may stop to open and read a note on the floor.

When the fourth song ends, each of you are reaching the end of your lives and you slowly fall to the ground.

## Liar

```
You are going to roleplay with someone without their consent. Without their consent or knowledge. Because they don't know they're part of your game, you don't get a pass on the fiction you're going to present. You will lie, and to that person, you will be a liar. They may never find out, and the interaction might still be a net win for them, but it will be true that you were not.

You can be anyone you choose—other than yourself—provided that the thought to choose them does not occur to you before your interaction begins.

Everything you say, your character believes implicitly. They're not some filthy liar.

There are two ways to win:
The conversation ends with your target better off and unsuspecting.
Your mark calls you on your bullshit; you apologize and tell them about roleplaying.
All other results are a loss.

Afterward, think about the value of truth, and how you tried to help your victim.
Is it better to lie to help someone, or to say nothing?
How did lying-for-real feel?
Was your emotional cost worth their gain?
What did you learn about your victim? Do you believe that?
What of your character will you keep?
```
<hr> 

## Hello - The Game

```
Have you ever been confused about how to greet someone? This is a game about that.
Before we start there are some things to decide:
Are you Social/shy?(Each player pick one)
Decide what the social context is. At a gamecon maybe?
Each one of you roll 1d6 – if you’re social add +1 to result (hidden from the other player)

1: You avoid any approach at a physical greeting.
2 : Handshake.
3: Half Hug - A quick wrap, lightly touching your partner where your arms only go halfway around.
4: Friendly hug - Put your arms lightly around your partner's shoulders and give a gentle squeeze.
5: Bear hug - Pull your partner in really close, put your arms completely around them, and squeeze tight.
6: Kiss on cheek (as many as you want, but decide before).
 
Play:
1.       The Social character goes first. Describe the budding signs of the gesture you're about to make.
2.       The shy character can now +/- 1 to die result. Describe how that looks.
3.       Play out the rest of the hug from each player's perspective (include inner monologue).
4.       Start the ensuing conversation and keep going until you think your done.

## Sync

```
You have memories and feelings you don’t want, but thanks to the revolutionary Sync process, you can change that!+ 

Sync is best with 4+ players in a plain, live action form. 

Each player begins with 2 Memories, 2 Emotions, 1 Goal. All Memories and Emotions should be created collectively, so Goals are attainable. 

- A Memory is a specific event, e.g., “My father’s death.”

- An Emotion is a feeling. Default Emotion List: Anger, Joy, Sorrow, Fear, Desire. Add more if you like.

- Each Memory has 1 Emotion associated with it to start.

- A Goal is the Memory/Emotion combination the character most desires. For example, “My father’s death/Sorrow.”  You cannot begin with both parts. 

Each Session, a player may Bond with one or two players. This allows transfer of 1 Memory or 1 Emotion for each player. For example, one player in the Bond may pass Sorrow to the other, while the other player gives her “Wedding day” memory. All parties must share. 

Sync sharing is as emotional and intimate as it sounds. Be brave.

Bonds cannot be forced. Be persuasive. 

There are 3 Sessions per Sync cycle, 15 minutes each. 

+Satisfaction not guaranteed.

## Might Makes Right: Muscle Marines in Space

```
You are Muscle Marines, charged with keeping the universe awesome.

Setup
The strongest player is the Muscle Master (MM), who runs the game, describing situations and people. 

Everyone else is a Muscle Marine. Name your Marine and write down four personality traits, six skills, and a Muscle Marine Profession (e.g. Muscle Pilot, Muscle Negotiator, Muscle Tactician).
 
Conflict
When you are in conflict, arm wrestle the MM. If a skill or profession applies to the conflict, use your good arm, otherwise use your bad arm (when mismatched, use palm to back of hand). If you win, your character overcomes the obstacle. If you lose, do 10 push-ups (seven if you are roleplaying a personality trait) and continue play. If you can’t finish the full set, you must hit the showers and are out of the game.
 
Muscle Missions
1.       Rescue a space gym from the Evil Beancounter Alliance.
2.       Help the Fitness Federation move into a cool new pad.
3.       Throw a Spacetacular party for your buds at the beach (watch out for space sharks).
4.       Put a stop to the SpaceSteroid Crisis of 2374.
5.       Bring the great science of healthy eating to Gluttonia

## Superstition
A PBTA Add-on

```
Mundane gestures can bring good fortune or bad luck.  The GM may ask: “What behavior do you witness here that is an act based on superstition?”

Characters have a new stat.: BELIEF
The GM will ask: “Do you believe in superstitions and why is that so?”
Players assign a modifier to their Belief stat: -1, 0, or +1 (Unbelieving, Uncertain, or Superstitious.)

Tempting Fate
When you are involved in a known popular superstition, roll+BEL
*On a 12+, same as a 10+ result and you may raise or lower your Belief by one. (-3/+3 max)
*On a 10+, gain two Good Fortune or Bad Luck holds.
*On a 7-9, gain one Good Fortune or Bad Luck hold.
*On a miss, you may raise or lower your Belief by one.

Spend a Good Fortune holds to gain Advantage on your next roll.
The GM may spends one of your Bad Luck hold to impose Disadvantage on your next roll.
He may ask at any time how many Bad Luck holds you currently have.
Good and Bad holds may cancel one another out.

Advantage: roll 3 dices, keep the two best results.
Disadvantage: roll 3 dices, keep the two worst results.

## The Spirits Somnia

```
You are training to be a Somnia, a deliverer of dreams.  Each night you fly through the gates of sleep to deliver dreams.  If you gain four or more nightmare points in seven nights, you will not become a Somnia.

Your Somnia has three traits.  You may put all three traits towards one type or chose a mix from either.

Horn [Truthful, Calming, Terrifying]
Ivory [Deceitful, Cunning, Soothing]

The gate you enter determines the type of dream delivered.  Roll one six-sided die (1d6) for the gate.

(4-6) Horn Gate – Prophetic Dreams
(1-3) Ivory Gate – False Dreams

Once you have a gate, describe and deliver your dream.  

Roll 1d4 for the number of nouns you must weave into your dream description.  If playing alone pick nouns from around you; if playing with others, they provide the nouns.

Roll 1d4 for each noun in the dream.  The sum of those roles is the dream number.  When delivering the dream, roll 3d6 dice.  For each trait you have for a gate, add or subtract two points to your delivering roll.  If the sum is 1-3 away from the dream number, the delivery was a success.  Otherwise gain one nightmare point.
```

## Astrum Arcanis

```
You are a starship, launched across space by the Cthonian Empress to defend her interests. Millenia later, she is gone and her monuments crumble — but you still wander the vacuum, banded together with other lost warships. Derelict and without purpose, how much longer can you survive the cold void?

Players:
Divide a Tarot Deck into decks for Major Arcana and individual suits.
Draw three cards from the Major Arcana. Use them as prompts to define your ship’s 
       Original Purpose, Weapons, and Body.

Ships have four stats: 
       Hull (Cups), Weapons (Swords), AI (Wands), and Flight (Pentacles).
Assign to each stat a value: (3), (3), (2), (2). Draw that number of cards from the appropriate suit’s deck.

The Cold Void’s Goals:
         Confront with forces seeking to destroy and demoralize.
         Emphasize loneliness.
         Encourage sacrifice.

Narrate with players where they are, what they’re doing. Continue until conflict arises or a player risks serious failure. If a ship refuses to back down, assign a challenge number 1-10. Player must discard a card—if they cannot meet or beat the challenge with an appropriate card, narrate failure. On success, draw a new card if available from the deck. Damage systems until the fleet falls apart.


```
<hr> 

## G.L.U.R.P.S.

```
Name thyself. Choose a main deal (pirate, wizard, spy, whatever). Google image search for a look.

Choose two things you're especially good at and write them on your sheet (be specific: two words for each, not just one!). They can be related to your deal or not. Choose one thing you're bad at. 

When you face an obstacle, roll dice or flip coins. Evens or heads are successes. Roll just one for a straightforward task (like stabbing a guy). Two or three for a more complex or difficult one (like disarming a bomb). 

For each thing you're good at that applies to the situation, reroll a failure. You can choose to reroll another if it falls inside your main deal. For a thing you're bad at, reroll a success. 

If you rolled neither all successes nor all failures, you got mixed results. For each success, narrate something that went right. For each failure, something that didn't. Failures lead to pain and new complications.

If you get three successes straight up doing something you weren't (yet) good at: now you are! Add it to your sheet and keep on truckin’. 
```
<hr> 

## Sonder

```
Go on a walk with some fellow players to a crowded place. Take photos of your group and the surroundings and then gather around a table.

Each player chooses a person from one of their photos (your “Stranger”).  Take turns inventing details about your Stranger, one detail at a time, such as:

Name
Favors
Partners
Children
Hometown
Kindest act
Favorite movie
Medical condition
Dream occupation
Losses and heartaches
Relationship with another Stranger
What they wanted to be when they grew up
Friend they’ve had a falling out with
Proudest achievement
Current occupation
Last vacation spot
Favorite book
Cruelest act
Aspirations
Hobbies
Siblings
Debts
Age

Anything else you can imagine.

When you are all satisfied, show everyone the photo of your Stranger.

Take a moment to talk about how each of you is but a Stranger to the hundreds of people you interact with or pass by each day.

Each person you see has a life and dreams as rich and vibrant as your own. How does this make you feel? Do you know these kinds of details about the other players? If not, are they just Strangers too? Share details about yourselves.
```
<hr> 

## ReWritten

```
This is a game for two, about a subject of a secret supersoldier program, who regained his memories and tries to break free. The player creates a personal Goal that the Soldier pursues (love, revenge, debt, guilt, whatever). Work out the details together. The GM creates interesting Challenges throughout the game.

You are in a lab. You don’t know how you got here. Fill in the Profile below to create your Soldier. Whenever you have to take on a Challenge, roll a D6. Find a sentence in the Profile that makes the Challenge easier or harder. Add 1 or subtract 1 from the roll, respectively.  The GM does the same with another sentence. On a score of 4+ you succeed and are closer to reaching your Goal. Otherwise a problem emerges. 

After each Challenge, part of your memory is overwritten (the GM changes one sentence in the Profile).

If you fail three Challenges in a row, you are recaptured and the game ends. If you overcome a total of 6 Challenges, you achieve your Goal (but can play on, until you are recaptured).
 

My friends call me…

I am…

I hate…

I love…

I need…

I can’t…

## BAD STUDENT

```
3-6 players.
In a parallel universe, after middle school half the students must be kicked out of school. You are teachers (choose your subjects) and must decide the fate of a group of students. Theoretically only grades and behavior matter, but your decisions cannot be questioned, therefore you are free to consider any factor (family, friends, medical conditions, wealth, racism, sexism, politics...)
- One teacher (the Leader) introduces a student: name, gender, appearance, geographical origin.
- Every teacher narrates 2 flashbacks, showing a good reason to make the student pass and a good reason to make her fail. Start narrating with “I remember…”, stick to your personal viewpoint and don’t contradict what has already been established.
- Discuss for exactly 5 minutes.
- Vote either Fail (raise your hand and say “Bad student”) or Pass (do nothing). The majority wins. On a tie, the Leader’s vote wins.
- The Leader narrates a flashforward telling the student’s future.
- Change the Leader and repeat for the next student, until all players have been Leaders.
Lastly, if less than half the students are kicked out, one teacher must be fired. Vote by pointing a finger and saying “Bad teacher”. Break the ties by voting again.

## Let's Eat Kevin!

```
All players write down one real or imaginary creature that eats people onto a scrap of paper.
Put all scraps into a hat including one that says “Kevin”.
Each player draws a scrap from the hat and announces who or what they are.

To Play: 
Those who are not Kevin must discuss the following topics and reach a group decision on each - in any order.
 
Where and when will you eat Kevin?
How will you prepare Kevin?
How will you divvy up Kevin?
In what order will you eat Kevin?
 
Here are the rules:
The decisions MUST be completely unanimous before you can move on.
Your decisions must reflect the creature or thing that you are.
Compromises and deals can be made.
If any additional questions arise they MUST be answered.
If Kevin brings up any point that is even remotely reasonable - it MUST be considered or answered.
 
Kevin! You desperately hope they will change their mind (they won’t). You must stall them. You must bring up reasonable points. If someone is a shark and they’re not discussing eating underwater, you must bring that up. If the group cannot agree within an hour, you escape!

## Incandescent Wars

```
In the beginning there was only Light, and then with a sudden implosion, Darkness grew and spread, leaving only pinpricks of Light to defend itself. In order to defend itself, the Light found a way to create Life.

You are an Incarnation of Life, the first made, in one of its most glorious myriad of forms. Your job is to stand against the forces of Darkness, so that life may flourish.

To do this, you have been given the ability to shift your form as you wish to be able to counter whatever it is the Darkness sends against you.
 
The System:
This is a pure battle of wits, where the players decide on what the limitations are to the battle, to what will be the end, and then determine who goes first.

The first one chooses a form, and then gets to attack. Unless you are able to come up with a counter to that form, you will take damage.

Damage is dealt in the form of the victor choosing if they want start or respond in the next round.
Once damage is dealt, forms reset and combat starts anew.   

```
<hr> 

## Strange Room

```
Everyone makes a character consisting of a name, a profession, a talent (physique, intelligence, social skill), and a reason they want to live.

Each of you wake up alone in a strange room. You have no idea how you got there.

The first player (determined randomly) describes what they see and what they do. Any other player may say, "perhaps it's different" in response to what they see, or "that may not work" in response to an action.

With the former, the objector proceeds to say how it's different, and either the first player agrees or everyone has a secret vote to decide.

With "that may not work", everyone rolls a die. The player with the character gets an additional die for each of their relevant aspects. Whoever gets the high die gets to say what happens. If the character fails, their despair goes up by one; if they succeed, their hope goes up by one.

Once a roll has been adjudicated, move on to a new scene with the player to the left.

If anyone's hope reaches 4, they describe how they get home; if their despair reaches 4, they describe how they get forever trapped.

## The Village

```
The elder ones in the village say the fog has always been there. And it is to be avoided. Everybody knows it’s not a regular fog. It never has been. It appears in bright sunlight, it started creeping out of the forest and it fools your senses. Over time it came closer to the village.

Only a few in the village have actually been in the fog by accident but they spoke of strange noises, a feeling of being watched and a desire to go in deeper, to find out what’s going on. Sometimes these stories are told at the campfire, choking the spirit of the community. 

One day someone new came to the village and rumor had it that he or she came out of the fog. Something about the being felt wrong. Both alien and familiar at the same time. It looked human but clearly wasn’t. But the strangest part was what words he or she uttered at the border of the village. 

Before walking into the fog, the being said: ’We don’t want you any harm. We want to help you. You can feast on our souls.’ Then it disappeared.

## Sympathetic

```
SYMPATHETIC
===========
By Ray Otus

Find, make, or draw a crude doll. Pass it from player to player to show whose turn it is. 

Crime
----------
Everyone plays a character who wants vengeance. On their first turn, each player states a fact about the person the doll represents and something that person did to deserve punishment. Make it colorful! It might be something someone has done to the player in real life, but they shouldn't declare that openly. Stay "in character."

Punishment
----------
After everyone has added at least one detail and crime and YOU feel there is enough to go on with, ON YOUR TURN say instead something horrific you do to the doll. Make it wicked! Then pass the doll to the next player, who will describe what happens to the target in real life. Make it horrible! Afterward the same player says what wicked thing they do to the doll and pass it. 

Regret?
----------
Once everyone has described a punishment and YOU feel sick or embarrassed, ON YOUR TURN say instead some form of "I'm sorry" and pass the doll. Everyone gets a chance to then say "I'm sorry" or "I'm not!"

Hug it out.

## Across the Table (2-Player)

```
You and a friend are in charge of opposing companies hoping to come to a mutual deal. Dig through your wallet and each use a random business card; these will be the companies you are each in charge of. Using a full deck of cards (minus jokers), deal out two cards face down to each player. Players will play a game of Texas Hold’em Poker where each card on the table represents an issue between the companies.
Suite - Issue
Hearts – Social
Diamonds – Financial
Clubs – Ethical
Spades - Personal
The goal is to make sure your company comes out on top of this deal. Players take turns making up issues between the two companies that they need to reach across the table to resolve. During the games, players can make deals, contracts, etc. If both players agree, each player can discard a card from their hand (face down) and draw a new one. The first three issue will appear on the table after players have introduced themselves and made small talk. The next two issues will appear only once a deal has been decided on for the previous one.

## The Haints' House

```
You are a Haint, a thing that goes bump in the night. You live in a military fort, or an old home, or an abandoned prison. Your job is to keep the humans out -- but you have to deal with all the other Haints bumping around as well.

Materials:

At least 1 GM
At least 2 players
1d6 per player
Pencils
Notecards

Write down the following: your Name, your Type (ghost, ghoul, nightmare, etc.), your Appearance, your Dread Power (possession, turn invisible, etc.), and a number between 2 and 5. If your number is closer to 6, you are more Friendly. If your number is closer to 1, you are more Spooky.

Each player also contributes one fact about the home.

When you do something Spooky -- intimidation, aggression, haunting, etc. -- try to roll over your number.

When you do something Friendly -- diplomacy, compassion, healing, etc. -- try to roll under your number.

If you roll an even number, you get an “and”. Describe what happens in addition to your roll, whether it’s a success or failure.

If you roll an odd number, you get a “but”. Describe what happens in spite of your roll whether it’s a success or a failure.

## Under The Mountain

```
Long ago catastrophe beset the great mountain hall of the Dwarves. It was ravaged and overrun, but several brave souls managed to escape, rescuing one of Dwarfkind’s prized relics. This is their story.


Pile some coins on the table.


Name your Dwarf and describe them, especially their beard (Dwarf women have beards too).


Everyone begins with two coins and three items:
* Armor
* Book
* Cask
* Gemstones
* Holy symbol
* Instrument
* Jewelry
* Lantern
* Map
* Mirror
* Mushrooms
* Pipe
* Quill & ink
* Tools
* Weapon


Your group possesses one relic:
* Ancient tome
* Runestone
* Hero’s banner
* Mountain’s Heart
* Sealed orders


Have someone begin by describing where they were when everything went wrong. Everyone then takes turns adding to the story from their dwarf’s perspective.


When facing trouble either succumb to it or flip a coin:
* Heads: overcome with style and skill.
* Tails: overcome with difficulty and pain.


Discard a coin:
* Begin a new scene on your turn.
or
* Re-flip a coin.
Give a coin:
* Interject and add trouble for another dwarf.
Gain a coin: 
* Play a supporting character (not your dwarf) in another’s scene.
or
* Succumb to trouble.
Free:
* Join another’s scene on your turn.
* Ask leading questions.


The game ends when you all escape the mountain.

## Gladiators

```
Players are Gladiators and fight each other to the “death”. One player is Cesar(GM), does not fight and gives thumbs up or down.

What you need to play:
5 dice* for each player. 1 Hat.

How to Play:
The setup:
Throw one die each to determine HP**, weapon and shield value. Use Dice as Token.
Cesar draws fight pairings from the hat***.

In the fight:
Each contestant throws two dice, then chooses one to add to his weapon value. the other goes to the shield value. The player loses 1 HP if the combined shield value is lower than the other players combined attack value. The fight ends after one player has lost 3 or his last HP. After losing 3 HP Cesar gives Thumbs up or down, if down you are dead. Should both players lose their 3rd HP in the same round, it’s a draw and bothe live. Victorious players can choose to loot their opponent but can only hold one weapon and shield each. Lost HP do not generate. Repete fighting until only 1 player is Left.

Have Fun

*Dice do not have to be six sided or identical. **Hitpoint ***Or just makes pairings up.
```
<hr> 

## HIRELINGS

```
Players are lords exploring dungeons with the aid of their hirelings.
Players start with 50 treasure(t) to spend:
Hireling-2t (choose class)
Equipment-1t 
Supplies-1t 

Hirelings start at d4. Each equipment increases the die by one. d4>d6>d8>d10>d12

Hirelings can perform manual labor and class skills.

Fighters can fight monsters. Each success kills one monster.
Magic-users cast spells. State the intent of the spell, GM sets difficulty.
Thieves are nimble and can go where others can’t. Thieves can disarm traps, reducing damage by number of successes. 
Clerics heal at camp, each success heals one hireling. They also turn undead, each success turns one.

GM sets the required successes for checks and can cap the number of hirelings that can test. State how many hirelings you’re using. Keep pools separate by class and injury status, then roll through all of them. Each 4+ is a success, uninjured 1s become injured, previously injured 1s die. Meet or exceed the required successes. Other players can contribute hirelings if you ask before testing.

Every 6 tests, camp must be made. Supplies feed 4 hirelings apiece. Unfed, uninjured hirelings become injured. Unfed, injured hirelings die. Supplies and healing may be shared.

```
<hr> 

## Nightblind

```
Night fell many years ago. It is the duty of the blinded to thrive, and thus show the sun that it is not needed. The sun is wicked and jealous, and sends monsters to corrupt and kill.

Everyone has a piece of paper on which they write down two skills that they excel at.

Everyone except for one person must then close their eyes.

This one person is the Sightseer. It is their sacred duty to describe the actions of the world and to roll the die.

When one of the blinded undertakes a risky action, the Sightseer rolls one six sided dice. The action succeeds on 5 or above, and fails otherwise. If the action uses a skill, the target is set at 3 and above. The Sightseer will report only if the action succeeded or failed.

Unfortunately, the Sightseer represents the damned sun, and is prone to lie. If a blinded wishes to challenge the Sightseer, they must first announce it, then they may open their eyes.

If the blinded is correct, their success is assured and they may close their eyes.

If the blinded is incorrect, they must replace the Sightseer in their cursed duty.

## Vestalia: Girls Just Want To Have Fun(ding)

```
This year’s stipend has arrived and every priestess wants to seize funding for their own projects! 
Grab a domino set, shuffle the tiles to form the boneyard.
Each Vestalis picks a number between 0 and 6. 
Title a card "stipend", then draw five checkboxes underneath.
Start each round by giving each Vestalis five tiles. 
Reveal all the doubles (same pips in both halves). 
The winner of the previous round or someone selected by lot picks one of the doubles or searches the boneyard for one.
The Vestalis whose number matches the pips and the one whose double was selected can write a project in an index card.
Clockwise, the Vestalis take turns matching tiles with those of the layout. If unable to do so, she picks tiles from the boneyard or skips her turn. 
If the sum of the pips of the open ends of the layout are multiples of five they can mark those number of points in any project card. If they had to pick from the boneyard, they must mark those in another Vestalis’ project.    
When a project gets 50 points, it is approved. Mark a stipend box. Celebrate. 
Game ends when there is no more stipend.

## High Arcana

```
Take a standard Tarot deck. Separate the high arcana cards (0-21 with specific names like Death) from the four numbered suits. The dungeon master’s deck consists of the high arcana cards. Players choose their class from the suits. Swords- fighter, wands- wizard, coins- thief, and cups- cleric.

Everyone shuffles their cards. The DM draws 7, the players 4. 

The DM groups his cards into 3 “rooms.” He uses their symbolism and imagery to describe the contents of a harrowing dungeon aloud. Each room’s difficulty is the sum of the grouped cards.

The player left of the DM describes what his character does to overcome the first room’s dangers. He places cards face down in front of himself. The sum of these cards should reflect the effort he described, hinting at their value.* The other players do the same in order.

Next, flip the cards. If the total sum of their efforts beats the DM’s, the DM describes the next room. If the players beat 3 consecutive rooms, everyone continues adventuring by shuffling and drawing again. If the players fail, they reveal their remaining cards and whoever has highest remaining sum switches places with the DM.

*Ace = 1 Face Cards = 10

## Znaroks Rocks

```
The players are 1 hockey coach and a number of hockey players. The coach must explain a game plan, but can only use pronouns, relative directions, conjunctions, numbers, prepositions and words based on the following list: Piss,
Fuck, Shit, Cunt, Dick, Ass, Tits, Balls, Imbecile, Bitch, Nincompoop, Sucker, Cock, Bastard and Damn.

“Based on” includes, but is not limited to changing case, number, mood, voice, mode, part of speech, forming compound words, prefixes, suffixes, infixes, interfixes.

As an added layer of challenge, the coach may draw up a game plan beforehand and the players need to reproduce that based on the instructions. 

Localizing the word list is highly encouraged. It's considered an added bonus if the participants know nothing about Hockey.

## Evil Goatees

```
There are good and evil dimensions. The joker from a deck of cards represents which dimension you are in. Shuffle the other 52 cards and place them face down.  Each player draws one card from the top of the deck and places it face up in front of them to represent how evil their goatee is.  If an ace is drawn, reshuffle and draw another card. A higher card represents a more evil goatee.

Start in the good dimension. Whenever a player attempts a difficult action, they draw the top card from the deck. The more evil their goatee, the harder the action is, so the drawn card must be greater than or equal to the player’s goatee to succeed.  An ace is a critical success, but all players are warped into the opposite dimension. The joker is flipped to show this.  When in the evil dimension, an evil goatee becomes an asset, and cards LOWER than or equal to a player’s goatee represent success. When you run out of cards, shuffle all cards, including goatee cards, back together. All players draw new goatees, then continue.

Roleplay as good or as evil as your goatee suggests!

## Our Precious Ghost

```
Your team just completed a mission but the heart of the team, the best of you… they didn’t make it back. This is the story of what happened, and why it matters so much.

Take turns filling in the blanks, clockwise around the table: “We got into _____ (a location) easily enough. We didn’t know ______ (the enemy) were waiting for us. We thought we had _______ (an objective) in the bag. But then, _____ (a person) showed up, and we knew. Things were about to turn bad.”

Continuing around the table clockwise you’ll describe each scene. The first scene is the team arriving at the location. If a character attempts something easy, they succeed. If they attempt something difficult, they fail, unless the player chooses to describe a scene in which they shared something, learned something, or received something from their soon to be dead comrade. The only action you cannot succeed on is saving them.

When they die, end the story. Have each player read the following sentence aloud, filling in the blank. “I’ll miss (pronoun) because ________.”

After everyone has gone, say the following. “____ was the best of us. And we’ll never get (pronoun) back.”
```

## Little Magic Shop

```
You just opened a magic item shop and got your first set of items from the Artificer’s Guild. Unfortunately, you're new so they unloaded all their weird experiments on you. Let’s see what they brought!

Best with 6 people.

Select a first player, this is the Shopkeeper. The other players are the members of the Artificer’s Guild who just delivered... something. Each Artificer gets to say one word about the object.

The Artificer to the Shopkeeper's left says what the object is: weapon, armor, accessory, or item.

The next Artificer says what the object is made of.

The other Artificers each say one adjective about the object. Anything goes!

The Shopkeeper then comes up with a description for the object. This should include its name, what it does, and how they will sell it.

The Artificer to the Shopkeeper's left then becomes the new Shopkeeper, and this repeats so all players become the Shopkeeper. Players then can vote for their favorite item. Players can't vote for the item from when they were Shopkeeper. Or you can simply enjoy the wacky items you came up with!

These items make great additions to a normal RPG game.

## Love is Pain, Dearest

```
You will need: a coin, clear glasses of water for each player, red, yellow and blue food coloring in a bag. 

Each player gives three details of the setting: Two tragic, one positive. 

Draw a dye from the bag. Choose an archetype and replace the dye. If player's draw the same color use an unselected option. Create a character based on this archetype.

Red = The Hero, The Everyman, The Caregiver
Blue = The Ruler, The Magician, The Explorer
Yellow = The Outlaw, The Innocent, The Jester

Look left. You love this character. Why?
Look right. You hate this character. Why?

The player with the most recent breakup goes first. Who is your scene partner? Flip a coin. 
Heads = Character you love 
Tails = Character you hate. 

Draw a dye. Put one drop into your scene partner’s water, then replace it in the bag. The color is your scene prompt.  Mutually initiate the scene. After the scene, pass the bag clockwise.

Red: Passion
Orange: Betrayal
Yellow: Meeting
Green: Misfortune
Blue: Argument
Purple: Heartbreak
Brown: Violence 
Black: The End

When a player’s water turns Black the game ends. Have each character end their story based on their current color.

## No... your friends

```
While with friends, get a pen and write these down in a piece of paper:
Always lie (unless asked a question identifying you correctly)
Always tell the truth
Always talk about the person on your right
Always change the topic when someone drinks or eats something
Always yawn while someone is talking
Always shift the conversation back to you
Never look at the person talking to you
Always sip your drink the moment someone talks to you
Always talk about a recent show you’ve seen
Fold the tissues individually so what is written cannot be seen. 
If there are more people than the list, add more blank paper and fold them.
If there are less, randomly remove until there is enough for the group less one. Then add one blank folded empty one.
The game starts once everyone has a paper and knows their role. The persons with the blank sheets must try to identify what the others had on their sheets. 

You can come up with new options if you want. You can even have adult options if your group is comfy with that. 

 There are no losers here. The fact you are among friends means you’re all winners.

## Spin the Bottle

```
Welcome to senior year!
School supplies:
* 4 or more people
* Paper
* Pencils (No. 2 preferred)
* A bottle
Sit in a circle with the bottle in the middle.
Populate your school: Nikki the queen bee. Jake the delinquent stoner. Embrace clichés! Write your character at the top of your paper, then write everyone else’s names below. As a group, list the scenes you want to see: the big game, drama club auditions, the mall after school. Everyone should contribute.
Spin the bottle: whoever it lands on picks a scene, sets it, and crosses it out. Anyone who wants to be there can, and the scene lasts as long as it should. After, everyone there writes down who’s a FRIEND, FOE, or CRUSH. Everyone on your sheet can only have one label, but it can change. Keep it secret and spin again. When the scene list is exhausted, the year ends at prom/graduation/whatever.
Report Card: For everyone who has you as a FRIEND, add one - for every FOE, subtract. If a CRUSH you have is mutual, add 2. If not, subtract 1. Before the credits roll, give a freeze frame voiceover saying what happened after graduation: highest score last.

## Truth, Lies and Bullets

```
Truth, Lies and Bullets
A dramatic game of tension and secrets.

The game is played by telling each other lies and truths and requires two six-sided dice.  Roll a d6, and whomever has the lowest score must go first.  On a tie, reroll the tied dice until one person has a lower result than the other.

On your turn you must make a statement about yourself.  Then roll a d6.  

The person on your right must then guess if your statement is a truth or a lie.  If they guess correctly, you must spin the cylinder and pull the trigger (by rolling another 1d6).  If the dice are the same, you blow your brains out and are out of the game.

If they guess wrong, you do not pull the trigger, and instead pass the gun (dice) to the player on your right and the truths, lies and bullets continue.  The “winner” is the last person standing.

```
<hr> 

## Nathan

```
Four friends arrive at a cabin. A hunting knife hangs from the door with a note and a name written in blood. 

“Nathan.” 

Someone plays Nathan; all others are friends.

Each friend offers a theory for the note. Write each theory on an index card; one card has already been marked “TRUE” on the back. All Nathan's friends will know the truth. 

Turn over a 3-minute hourglass. Everyone will describe their character as the killer picks them off one-by-one. Before the sand runs out, a player must reveal a scary moment and choose a playing card. 

Black = false alarm 
Red = danger! 

When a friend receives their third red card, they die. Dead friends can now play the killer and place red cards on characters. 

Start the next player's turn by flipping the hourglass as is. 

When only Nathan remains, every black card becomes a wound to the killer. When the killer receives 3 black cards, the killer is dead. Nathan dies when he receives his fifth red card. 

If any player fails to complete their description before the hourglass runs out, their character is instantly killed and the hourglass restarts at full.

## Hero Monsters

```
Monster Master:

The monster master is suppose to narrate around each monster he draws from a the stack of monster cards.

Hero Cards:

At the start of the rotation, shuffle the deck of heroes and draw a card. The other players should do the same.

Heroes and Monsters:

Monsters and Heroes both have the following stats:

Attack / Defense / Health Points

To defeat someone:

Throw a d20, if the number is bigger than the defence then the attack is landed. 20, is a critical hit, which means x2 of your total dices.

Horde Cards:

Such cards instruct the MM to draw cards equal to the given number, the heroes must defeat all monsters in order to continue.

Treasure Cards:

At the conclusion of a battle draw one treasure card each.


Finish Game:

It is possible for the MM to draw a boss monster card, defeat the monster to conclude the story and proceed to rotation of the MM role.


Level 1:

Damage: d6 + Attack*
Protection: d6 + Defense

…

*You can only do one of two each turn and select target.

For each level add +1 Dice. Maximum Level is 20.

3+ players. One of which must be the Monster Master.

## Meltdown - Your Last Battle

```
You finally have the Power, but will you achieve your goal before you meltdown?

Whether it’s to finally defeat the bad guy or rush to turn your group paper in on time, as a group, pick a goal.

Describe your character concept.

Between mental and physical, decide dominant trait. Roll d6 for dominant related obstacles and d4 for non-dominant.

Describe your two trademark skills. Related tests receive a +1.

Fill an 8oz cup with water and ice cubes.

To Play

GameMaster describes an obstacle. Player states intention on how to overcome the obstacle. GM sets a logical obstacle difficulty between 3 and 9. Roll the die at or above the difficulty to succeed.

To upgrade die, stick a 30mL syringe into your cup of water. Block vision and draw the syringe. At 0-9mLs no change, 10-19mL upgrade one die size, 20-20ml upgrade two die sizes, 30ml upgrade three die sizes. Die sizes are d4, d6, d8, d10, d12. Remove drawn water from play. Remove an ice cube to reroll. 

If you succeed by more than 4, remove an ice cube. You used too much Power. It weakens you. 

When all your ice cubes are melted or removed, you are defeated.

```
<hr> 

## The Hero's Last Stand

```
Your party is under attack.
Will you be a hero? Even if it means dying?

Give your character an Essence: a defining trait or proficiency.

The GM sets the scene and everybody discusses possible actions. Each round, one or more players describe and take actions.

The GM assigns each action a difficulty from 3 to 6 and chooses its alignment:

                - Recklessness   |   + Recklessness
                                 |
     + Valour        Victor      |        Hero
   ------------------------------o-------------------
     - Valour       Survivor     |       Victim
                                 |

Your alignment (if any) is determined by your Recklessness and Valour points, which start at zero.

Modify the action’s difficulty:
  Same alignment as you: -1
  Opposite alignment: +1
  Essence helps: -1
  Essence hinders: +1

Success is D8 >= difficulty.

Adjust your Recklessness and Valour by +1 or -1, according to your action’s alignment.
Gain a Lost token if your Recklessness increased.
Gain a Victory token if your Valour increased and your action succeeded.
Gain a Lost token if you rolled a 1.

The GM describes the outcome of each action, then introduces the next round.

If you have at least 3 Lost tokens, you die next action.

The game ends if:
  The party (including dead players) has at least [2 * party size] Victory tokens
  Everyone is dead
  All hope is lost
```
<hr> 

## Lighthearted Friend

```
To be played after my other entry, “Jack the Ripper.”

History tells us that Charles Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll) could not have been the Whitechapel killer, because he was enjoying a summer in the country with child actress Isa Bowman at the same time as many of the murders occurred.

One player is CHARLES.
One player is ISA.
One player is ID. 

ID finds a nasty piece of erotica on the internet and picks the most graphic paragraph. (Do NOT show it to ISA!) CHARLES must rearrange the letters in the paragraph to form a brief, clean, entertaining children’s story. CHARLES must use every letter in the paragraph, and cannot use a letter more times than it appears in the original.

CHARLES reads the story he wrote to ISA. ISA must try to guess a sex act that occurred in the original paragraph. If ISA is wrong, everyone switches roles and the game starts over. If ISA guesses correctly, the game must end immediately!
```
<hr> 

## Vigilantics

```
Need:
1 GM and 2+ Players
Paper and Pencils
1 d6

Every player creates a "superhero" with a gimmicky "superpower" and a choice of three gadgets. These “heroes” have no superhuman abilities.
ex.) Danger Dad: World’s greatest dad, world’s greatest employee, and world's worst superhero.
Power: Gut Busting Dad Joke
Gadgets: Trusty Toolkit, Dad-Mobile (family van), and Cargo Shorts of Carrying

The hero abilities are Speed, Might, and Brains.
All abilities have one point by default, but players may distribute four more between them.


When rolling the d6 for an ability, you must roll below your ability score.
Gadgets can only be used once, but powers can be used infinitely.
Powers and gadgets always succeed, but may vary in effectiveness.
On all rolls, a one is a perfect success, and the closer to six, the worse the effectiveness of your action, even for successes.

"Crash!" "Bang!" "Pow!" Our unlikely heroes appear on the scene to stop our villain. Only one of these heroes can reach the newspaper headlines, so whoever can capture the villain and hand him to the authorities first wins, but if they don't act soon, our villain’s plans will begin, causing everyone to lose.

## Memories

```
You are elderly people in a Nursing home. No one comes to see you anymore. You want to talk with others, tell them about your life, your dreams, and your memories.

Sit around a table. Get nine matches and an ashtray. Cut a paper sheet in nine pieces and write a word in each piece. These words are your conversation topics.

CHILD  LOVE  SPOUSE  WORK  FRIEND  GAME  TRAVEL  GRANDCHILD  HOME

One of you take a piece of paper and begins to talk about the topic in it. While speaking he lights a match and set fire to the paper in the ashtray. All of you talk about the proposed topic until the paper is consumed. Then a new elder takes another piece of paper and proceeds in the same way, but all of you have forgotten your memories related to the previous topic. You cannot use them in the new conversation. If the memories are necessary (for example, you must have CHILD in order to have GRANDCHILD), you must justify it in another way.

Finish when the nine pieces of paper have been burned —and, with them, all your memories.

```
<hr> 

## Opposystem

```
The storyteller describes the setting, and how the group of characters fit within the setting, then players create their characters.

Each character has attributes and skills. The storyteller guides, and must agree to, all attributes and skills.
Players may choose any attribute, but only if they can convince another player to take its opposite. For example, if one player wants to be strong, they must convince another player to be weak. Each attribute may only be used once in the group.
Each player also chooses 3 to 5 skills. These may be narrow or broad, provided there is no overlap between the skills of any characters in the group. For example, if one character is skilled in “combat”, no other character may be. However, if one character is skilled in “melee”, another may be skilled in “archery”.

When a challenge or conflict occurs in the game, the storyteller determines the difficulty, from 1 to 5, and decides if the character’s attributes and skills help, hinder, or do not affect the challenge. The player rolls 3 dice. If hindered, the lowest die is used, if helped, the highest die, otherwise the middle die. If it exceeds the difficulty, the character succeeds.

## Spiral

```
Spiral

Draw a spiral.  The larger the spiral,  the longer the game. 

Create a conspiracy. Bring it to life. 

Show your friends the spiral. 

What is the mystery behind the spiral? Investigate the conspiracy. 

Mark the start of the spiral. How deep does it go? 



Rules 

Trying something relatively simple? Narrate it. 

Trying something difficult or dangerous? Roll a d6. The result of the die is a degree of success or failure, and a measurement of how many centimeters the marker moves towards the center of the spiral… and the conclusion of the investigation. 

As the marker moves towards the center of the spiral,  the mystery becomes clearer; the investigators bolder and more capable. However,  things also become more dangerous,  surreal, and horrific, slowly escalating as the investigation twists and turns. 

Investigators narrate their actions and roll dice, the spiral maker narrates the results based on the investigators’ die rolls (and the overall investigation)

Die results

1 = catastrophic failure. 

2 = moderate failure.  

3 = minor setback.

4 = harrowing success.

5 = moderate success.

6 = critical success.

Once the marker passes the spiral’s halfway mark,  investigators roll 2d6, choosing the higher result. During the final few turns of the spiral, investigators roll 3d6.

## King's Dice

```
King’s Dice is a simulated gambling game.

Set-up:
Each Player needs twenty six-sided (d6) dice.
There is one communal twenty-sided (d20) King’s die.

Game-play:
Players roll the d20. Highest roller starts with the d20. The d20 is rolled. All players starting with the d20 roller say how many d6 they will roll. Each player rolls the dice specified. Sum each player’s dice. Player closest to the d20 result wins all the d6 rolled. Winner then rolls the d20 for the next round.

In the event of a tie, tied players take one additional d6 and decide whether the die will add or subtract from their total. Players roll the dice and adjust their totals. Continue until there is no tie or someone is out of dice. If a player runs out of dice during a tie-breaker, they roll no more dice that turn. Should a player’s sum equal the d20 result, before ties, and is the only player to do so, that player wins the round plus one additional die from each player. The game ends a player has no dice at the end of a round. The player with the most d6s at the end of the game wins.

## A Fistful of Dust

```
Law forgot this place when the glimmer-mines ran dry. The unquiet-dead haunt the mountains now. Ghost-Towns. There are bandits too, deserters from the civil-wars back East. I guess they used to call you a Knight. You also used to be dead. Now you’re just drifting.

What’s your name?
What marks you as Undead?

Rank, from 1-4: 
Gun-Slinging
Sleight-of-hand
Fast-Talking
Laying-low

Throw that many coins in a conflict. 
Throw an extra coin if you have an advantage.

If you throw all Heads, throw another coin. Keep on like this until you throw a Tails, or get 4 Heads. 

4 Heads is a flawless success. 0 Heads is complete, utter failure. In between lie part-successes, difficult choices, hard bargains.

You can re-throw by ticking off one of the following, and saying how it helps:

-Concealed Artefact
-Unwitting Accomplice
-Wytchery
-The Landscape
-Flashback

When you tick the last option, the scene ends with your death (again).

Choose 1 of the following Wytcheries that you can use whenever. Fill in the blanks.

-I can see the [______] in every [______].
-I can change [______] to [______], and back.
-I can produce a [______] from thin air. 
-I always know [______].
-My dreams say [______].

Need: 1D6, tokens 
Two players: Girlfriend, Boyfriend
Boyfriend reads everything before asterisks aloud

Girlfriend. Choose 3+ quirky behaviours you’re into and your appearance. (e.g. hair bows, making up songs, knitting). For each detail add a token to your pool. 

Your boyfriend is troubled; you need to come up with neat ideas for things to do together. Stay in character throughout the game. 

Describe an idea for a fun thing to do together, roll a D6. If he’s delighted: Roleplay that date and share something real about yourself or your feelings. 

Otherwise pay a token to Boyfriend; remove that behaviour or look.

Describe a new date-idea. Roll again.

If you receive a token back you can reinstate a detail or invent something new. 

******* 

Boyfriend. You are reliant on girlfriend for your happiness.

If she’s not sufficiently delightful you become withdrawn, sullen, frustrated. Resist her attempts to engage you unless she rolls 6, then be cheerful and affectionate for a brief time.  

If you don’t like an emotion or truth she shares, take one of her tokens. 

You can give a token back if she delights you.
 
When girlfriend has no tokens left, break up with her.

## On the seventh day Gods had finished...

```
You all are Gods. Choose your domain, describe your character and favorite depiction.
You all barely defeated Titans, but they’ll be back. You gather to create a world to
determine who most powerful one – he will lead you in the next battle against Titans. Describe how your new world looks like so far.

You think that God on your left will deal with Titans better. He is now your Oracle.

During your turn:

Give the world something empowering our domain, then modify the previous thing created, so it will compliment either your, or your Oracle’s domain;

or tell a myth that will strengthen your Oracle’s position as a leader, or mock other God. After a myth is told every God can choose a new Oracle for himself.

Now it’s the player on your lefts’ turn.

Whenever something builds up your domain’s strength, give yourself a point.

Each day begins on a random God, as he adds something to the developing world. The day ends on the same God, as he modifies most recent creation.

After six days the world is complete. Titans come back, prepared to fight. God(s) with most points determine the outcome of the confrontation.

The magistrate interrogates the suspects.

Players: 4
Materials: Four cups of dark tea. One coin, marking the poisoned cup. 

Setup: Declare your character (the Bandit Toshiro, the Wife Machiko, the Samurai Masayuki, the Magistrate Akutagawa). Players close their eyes. The Magistrate opens their eyes, places the coin in one cup, pours the tea and distributes the cups. Players open their eyes. The Magistrate chooses who speaks first.

Play:
*On your turn, explain what transpired and point the finger at the murderer. 
*To take over the story, shout “That’s not how it was!”. Explain what really happened.

*To make the speaker’s story true, say “that is how it was” and trade cups with the speaker. 

If you drink your tea you are pardoned and leave the game. If you drink the poisoned cup you die. If you are left alone with the Magistrate, he arrests you.

Winning:
*Samurai: Take the blame instead of your Wife. 
*Bandit: Escape scot-free.
*Wife: Trick your husband into drinking the poison.
*Magistrate: Pardon the Samurai and his Wife.

## Ghosts & Flowers

```
City burning and smoking ruins. Wandering ghosts.
You: alone. You’re running at night in the streets of the city looking for a flower. 
What flower, why and what for ?

Discard the faces from a 52 cards deck. Shuffle the 40 remaining cards.
Each turn, draw a card. 
Red is neutral or good, you keep the card. Black means a conflict. 
Use “Meaning of cards” for inspiration and tell what is happening.

When a conflict:
discard 2 cards and you win
OR
draw a card. If the value is lower than the conflict’s card, you succeed. If not, things go wrong:  you must discard 2 cards.
Cards used during a conflict are discarded.

Winning: If you get 10 red cards before drawing the last card from the deck, you find the flower. If not, you epically fail!


Meaning of cards (when several words, choose one) 

1 Stray dogs / cats / wolves / crows
2 Somebody needs help
3 Undead / spirit of the forest
4 Gang of bikers / vagabonds / slaves
5 A demon with an animal look
6 Ghost hunters 
7 Flesh-eating insects / rats / bats
8 Ghosts searching for souls
9 Witches / cultists / priests 
10 An old enemy

## Songs for empty apartments

```
Your love is gone.
You're alone in your apartment.
You're alone with the songs of your love story.
You're going to reconstruct it.

You need three friends and your smartphones.

Before play, each of you chooses a song.

The one who lost their love more recently is the Voice. Going in clockwise direction, the others will take respectively the roles of Drums, Bass and Guitar.

1. Drum, play your song and ask a question about how it became meaningful for the relationship. It can range from a simple “Why this one?” up to a very loaded and targeted question. Set a scene framed around that memory.
2. Bass, take the question from the Drums and start asking the Voice about it, using questions about whens, wheres, whys, hows and such.
3. Voice, play the protagonist, answering the Bass’s questions. Bass and Voice, keep conversing in a Q&A fashion.
4. Guitar, stop the Bass and the Voice at a climactic moment, then answer the questions from the lost love’s point of view. What you say cannot be questioned by the Bass.

After a scene, roles shift clockwise.
Repeat three more times.

## What Could Go Wrong?

```
A Game of Heists and Hilarious Consequences

YOU NEED:
3-6 players, no GM
A die with the same number of faces as the number of players

MECHANIC:
When a player-character takes an action, they declare what they hope the result will be and assign it to the highest face on the die. 

(Player A says, “I detonate the explosives. On a 4, the bank vault door blows open.”)

Then they say, “What could go wrong?” and pass the die around the table. For each other face of the die, another player describes a different result. Each must be WORSE than the one before it.

(Player B says, “On a 3, the explosives don’t go off.” Player C says, “On a 2, they go off and trigger the sprinkler system.” Player D says, “On a 1, they go off and set all the money on fire.”)

Then the acting player rolls and discovers the true consequences of their action.

Before you play, you can use the same mechanic to define the elements of the heist, such as Target, Location, Attack Plan, and Getaway Plan. Each player suggests an idea for each element, and one player rolls to determine which to use.
```
<hr> 

## HEIST!

```
Form a crew. Pull a heist. Get away with it.

Each player draws a card from a deck to determine play order. Highest card wins - weight goes spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs. No jokers.

First player is pointperson. They know the job: naming the loot, who wants it, and where it is. They then describe the first impossible obstacle.

Second player explains who they are, and how they can overcome that obstacle. Then, they describe the next impossible obstacle.

Play proceeds with each player explaining who they are, how they can overcome the last obstacle, and naming the next obstacle.

Pointperson needs to overcome the final impossible obstacle.

Once the crew is assembled, the second player draws two cards to start the heist, revealing one. If black, their job goes smoothly. If red, there’s a complication. They describe it, and explain how they overcome it.

Each player then pulls two cards, in turn, and reveals one, as above. Pointperson goes last.

More than half the job is black? Success! Payday! Infamy!


More than half the job is red? Failure! Everyone reveals their second card to see if they escape. If red, describe how you’re caught. If black, describe your daring escape.

## Chromed poets

```
There is a war in space. Big robots piloted by humans fight each other with laser swords and beam cannons. The war has been going on for a long time but it is about to end. It ends today, with this battle.

You are the two best pilots of your factions and fight each other one last time, deciding everyone’s fate.

You compose haikus using at least one of the words listed below in each.The fastest pilot to compose the first haiku starts.

The pilots then alternate at composing haikus. The haikus should answer to each other and are about who you are, what you pilot, why you fight, what is this war about, your relationship with each other and scenes from your battle.

The first pilot to use all the words below in their haikus, wins the war. Their last haiku must describe the consequences for their faction. The other pilot gets then to write a final haiku with any word to describe the consequences for everyone else.

Metal - sword - sunrise - rose - planet - space - nuclear - explosion - dust - particle - chrome - ring - divine - rebel - fire - attack - transform - colony - door - peace - stardust - comrade - human - exploration - star - alien - terror - field - god - fly

## To Serve A Monstrous Empress: A Sacrifice

```
Four players: One Empress, four artificer-supplicants.

Bring: Tokens in three colors, four bowls, one bag.

The Empress is: (Circle four) 

Slick / Armored / Insectoid / Dead / Humanoid / Divine / Writhing / Bloody-tongued / Alien / Naked / Daemonic / Mechanical / Blind

Describe Her.

Each artificer-supplicant is: (Circle four)

Genderless / Desperate / Skilled / Secretly, Tremblingly In Love With The Empress

What you have left to give: Tokens: your VITALITY, SANITY, and DIGNITY.

One-by-one, in no order, snatch one token each--concealing them under your bowls--until each player has… seven? (Did you get one more? Glow with secret pride and shame.)

To embody the Empress first: sweep visible tokens into the bag.

AUDIENCE:

[No character speaks--make noises.

You’ll make ridiculously overwrought grimdark-ass gifts for the Empress, enhancing Her GRANDEUR, HORROR, and ALLURE.

Artificer-supplicants, simultaneously: prostrate yourselves. Gather tokens; raise this offering in your trembling hand. 

Players: each describe your offering: weapon, art-object, piece of yourself? (Yes.)

Empress: Take. Everything. Describe your treatment of the one artifact that best pleases you. Stroke its maker’s head.

Hurl tokens into the bag.]

Next: Embodiment of the Empress passes left. Another AUDIENCE. 

When you’ve nothing left to give: At last! FEED YOURSELF TO THE EMPRESS. How does this change Her? 

Play until only the Empress remains.

## Competitive Reality Television

```
Setup:

Players select an appropriate reality show trope contestant, an auxiliary skillset, and two 6-sided dice (2d6).
 
The Reality Show Host/Producer (GM) chooses and explains the contest rules and challenge theme. This game supports any competitive reality show. Each episode (game session) is broken down into challenges, workroom, confessionals, and eliminations.

Gameplay:

CHALLENGE MECHANIC: Players explain their actions, roll 2d6 plus any drama dice (d4) and compare totals.

Each episode is a play session containing:

The mini-challenge – Players CHALLENGE; scores resulting over 8 or under 6 earn a d4 drama die.

Workroom - Players describe their intended submission for the contest and earn a drama die.

Confessionals – Player SPOTLIGHT;  Players talk about other contestants or their submission. GM modifies the discussed Player’s drama dice pool, adding d4 for HYPE or removing d4 for SHADE. Players may instead talk about THEIR auxiliary skillset allowing the GM to modify their drama pool as above.

Elimination Challenge – Players CHALLENGE; Highest total wins the episode and earns a d4 for the next episode, lowest is eliminated from the competition.

GM may add challenges to an episode by repeating any steps above. There MUST BE a confessional step preceding a challenge.

## Steam Burst

```
Tools: 52 pack of cards, 10 D6s

Players are the crew of a steampunk mech in a scenario set by the GM.
The player roles are:
Pilot
Gunner
Arm Manipulator
Harpooner

Gm permanently removes 15 number cards, preferably high from some suits, low from others.
Each suit is a steam capacitor, each player chooses one.
Mech's furnace can be on or off.
If furnace is on, players start turn by drawing a card.
If card is number, place on that capacitor's pile.
If card is picture, that capacitor is now unusable.


When a player does something, GM decides on difficulty, 1-10 and rolls that many dice.
Player adds up their capacitor's cards.
Force Check:
If cards > dice, success

Dexterity Check:
If cards < dice, success

Precision Check
If cards are between values of two separate rolls, success.

Actions (2 per turn):
Swap 2 players capacitors
Change furnace state
State an action
Repair (Shuffle all cards back into deck)

Gm uses abstract time, combat initiative up to GM.
GM decides number and difficulty of D6 dice enemies use to attack.
If mech is hit, draw a card, discard top 3 cards of that capacitor.
Picture cards aren't discarded.

## The Empire won the war, but the people lost

```
The empire of Aradia just won a war, but its people lost. Refugee Foxen, Leos, Corvids, and Humans have flooded the capital city of Adrannar. Living in squalid conditions, some have turned to crime to survive. Some have left the city in search of adventure. Some are talking of revolution.

The Emperor Odar appears unconcerned about the conditions of his people. General Deadra believes the army should be used to quell the unrest. Chancellor Yepreffen argues in court for negotiation and social projects, but privately funds many of the revolutionary groups in hopes of elevating himself to Emperor.

Outside the city, a wartorn landscape is full of destroyed keeps, ancient ruins, and local warlords keeping just small enough to avoid the attention of the Empire. Fierce beasts, bloated on the meat of corpses, are in search of more prey. Life outside is quite dangerous.

To Play

Describe your character. Choose three positive and two negative traits. When undertaking an action, roll 1d6 vs GM 1d6 - higher wins. If a positive trait would aid, roll 2d6, take the higher. If a negative trait would hinder, roll 2d6, take the lower. Characters have ten health. Successful attacks remove 1 health.

## Segmentation Fault

```
In a world where everyone has a price, and technology’s true cost is intangible: One player is a Corporation. The rest are Outlaws scrabbling to survive.

Get in. Get the target. Get out. Get paid.

Allocate +3, +2, +1, +1, +0 to Styles:

Precise
Ruthless

Brains | Start a side mission to increase success or reward of your main
Muscle | Intimidate anyone who sees you in action
Face   | Learn anyone’s price
Tinker | Prepared tech: 3x per mission, neutralize a complication
Sneak  | Get into anything

When you try something risky, describe how, sum 2d6, and add the appropriate Style. Add +1 if one of your Roles applies, or +3 when using your primary's Special.

<= 6: failure. Situation worsens. If your primary Role applies, instead get a complicated and partial success.
7-9: partial or complicated success. The Corporation presents two choices.
10-11: success.
12+: success with bonus.

Successful missions:
2: +1 Style

## Out of the Dark World

```
You are children, taken to the Dark World and imprisoned by Nightmares. You run through the dark corridors of an empty school to escape your jailer, the Butcher.

Your memories are blurry. You need answers:
1. Where is the heart of the Dark World?
2. Who is ruling now?
3. What happened here?
4. Who are the prisoners?
5. How to go back to the real world?

GM, put 4 six-sided dice on the table.

Players, when you try to:
- run for your life,
- be sneaky,
- be convincing,
- get an answer to the first unanswered question of the list (GM, ask how),
take a die and roll it. (Without die, you fail.)
You succeed on 4+. Otherwise, the GM will say you are now afraid, chased, hurt, trapped or broken. (GM, keep the die.)

If you ever fight, you are hurt, captured or worse.

In a quiet time, one of you can recollect something to put a die back on the table.
(GM, reincorporate it into scary descriptions.)

Locations: Decaying underground forest / Foggy sewer market / Abandoned subway station / Silent troglodytic dwellings
Chasers: Stalking shadows / Spiderhounds / Scalpel Dancer / The Grinning Girl
People: Arachnoids / Leeches / Faceless / Drowned Ones
```
<hr> 

## Last Cigarette

```
For 2 players, at least one of whom must be a smoker.

One player plays the Condemned, who is given the chance to have one last cigarette before being executed. The other is the Executioner.
The game begins with the lighting of the cigarette(s). It ends when the cigarette is finished, establishing that the characters will never talk again.

Pre-game considerations:
-	What is the period of this scene?
-	Why is the Condemned being executed?
-	What is the previous relationship between these two characters, if any?

Post-game considerations:
-          Did the relationship between these characters change during the scene?
-          Which character held the true power by the scene’s end?
-          What did the characters share?
-          What happens next?

You can choose to exchange the cigarette for another consumable device and/or the characters for other archetypes. Examples:
-	The characters are an Informant and a Handler meeting one last time.
-	Exchange the cigarette for a drink (coffee, beer, milkshake) or a meal
-	The characters are lovers ending the relationship with one last dance (the scene lasts for a song’s length)
-	The characters are Wounded and Another, where the Wounded will die at scene’s end.
```
<hr> 

## Yammer

```
YammerIsAFastTalkingRPGDesignedToMakeYouThinkOnYourFeetAndKeepSpeaking.

Each player must speak as fast as possible during a conversation encounter.

The GM will score each player’s Yammering out of 10, on 3 criteria: Material, Length, and Speed.

The Material value is how entertaining the player was. Tangents and stories are allowed, as long as they relate to the topic (eventually).

Length is how long the player Yammered.

Speed is how quickly the player Yammered.

Once the GM believes the player has become too incoherent, disinteresting, or hesitating; the next player must begin Yammering.

Subsequent Yammers must avoid repetition and begin where the previous player ended in terms of topic.

After the encounter, the GM will sum of all scores for the players. Scores above 60 should succeed (and some with higher scores), below should cause complications.

A session of Yammer should contain 4 encounters (1 per player).

Example settings and encounters:

* The players are secret agents at a party. They may need to convince guards, extract information from the mastermind, or get the aid of an enemy agent!
* The players are at a dead end job. They may need to Persuade the boss to keep their jobs, or calm an unruly customer.

## A tale untold

```
On a cold and abandoned Earth, we have found a relic from times of Men. Gather around and put it on display for everyone to see!

It could have been a teapot or an old radio. Now it is all dust and rust. And for us, who harvest stories of Men, its tale is still untold.

***

Secretly decide whether you are repulsed or fascinated by the relic.

Whenever you feel brave, take the relic. The others ask you questions. Who had made it? How did it feel? Where have you found it? Answer one that suits you best.

Now, do you see a Scar or a Replacement on the relic? Scar: describe it and ask someone how did it happen. Decide if they lies and why. Replacement: ask someone to describe it. You tell how did it happen. They decides if you lie and why.

Put the relic on display again for someone to take it.

***

When you feel the story is complete, roll d6 + lies. If the result is higher than Scars + Replacements, the tale remains untold. The repulsed win. If the result is lower than Scars, the relic is destroyed and no one wins.

## Hacksaw: The Phone Call of Death

```
You have woken with the other players in a fiendishly deadly game of an evil genius bent on teaching you a valuable life lesson. 

You'll need:
1d10
A phone.
A timer. 

How to play:
The first player (picked at random) describes a horrible death trap. The player on their right is caught in this trap.

The trapped player writes down a phone number of someone they know, but leave one of the digits empty. Roll d10, enter that digit in the empty space. The player dials the number. 

If there is no answer they live for another round. 

If the phone is answered start the timer. The player engages in a conversation, in character, about the death trap. Stop the timer when either person hangs up. 

Consult the chart:

1-10 seconds 
Your character died attempting to escape. Game over. 
11-20 seconds 
Your character suffers major injury.
21-30 seconds 
Your character suffers minor minor. 
31+ seconds 
Your player has escaped the death trap. You learned a valuable life lesson. 

If you get the same result in the chart as a previous result, use the next highest result. 

Play continues to the left. 

There are no winners, only survivors. 
```
<hr> 

## Demon Dare

```
Each player creates a Person and a Demon.

For Persons, decide:
A name;
Your Truth: an unspeakable secret you will never reveal.

Let everything else emerge during play.

Demons drive humans to self-destruction. Choose a Demon’s Name: [attribute] + [title] + of + [purview]. E.g. “Cruel Lady of Tears.”

Frame scenes in turn: focus on a Person and have a Demon dare them to do something destructive. Be inspired by the Demon’s Name.

Person’s player, tell the Demon’s player what could convince you. You cannot refuse in the end.

Draw a poker card:

A-K-Q-J: You get away with it;

10-9-8-7-6: You do it, with cost or complication;

5-4-3-2: You screw up.

Play out the outcome together. You can never reveal your Truth, even if you would like to.

From the second card on, build a house-of-cards. From the third card on, if your house-of-cards falls, your Truth comes to light.

If your Truth comes to light, make a deck with the cards of your crumbled house-of-cards and draw one:

A-K-Q-J: You come clean (what did you learn?) and destroy a Demon.

10-9-8-7-6: Choose:
You come clean;
You get a scar, but destroy a Demon.

5-4-3-2: Your life is forever scarred. How? Why?
```
<hr> 

## Triad - Deckbuilding Game

```
There are 2 decks: Stats deck (Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity cards) and Main (Spells and Equipment cards) deck.
Everyone draws 8 cards at random from the stats deck, and 2 from the Main deck.
Place and flip up 6 cards from the main deck in the center row and begin.

The objective is to use spells/equipment (armor and weapons) to kill your opponents.
Every turn, draw a stat point from the stat deck and 4 cards from your deck.
Discard 3 stat cards to buy any 2 power stat card, which are set aside from the primary stat deck.
Use these cards to buy items and spells in the center row, which go into your discard pile.
At end of turn, all cards played go into the discard pile, and draw a new hand.
When you’re out of cards in your deck, shuffle the discard pile and it becomes your deck again.
This deck essentially defines your “class”

Spells/Equipment have specific costs (ex. Fireball = 2 Int, Bow = 2 Dex, 1 Str)
Spells may be played once per turn for free; Equipment are played and stay out.
Most equipment either have passive buffs or activated abilities, like attacks.
```
<hr> 

## DUELLO - A Game of Magic and Politics

```
Setting: A League of competitive wizard’s duels.

Conflict resolution operates using a timer. Each character must describe what they are doing in response to their opponent, within their timed Round. The opponent will then describe their counter within their Round, continuing until one side cannot respond, and is declared defeated. 

Character Creation:

Begin by choosing two schools:

-Abjuration (Warding, denial, blocking opponents)
-Evocation (Energy/Fire/Explosions)
-Transmutation (Change)
-Necromancy (Death)
-Illusion (Phantasms/ Trickery)

These will flavour your descriptions in battle. Additionally, distribute 4 points between Luck and Ability. Each point in Ability grants you 10 seconds of talking time per Round. Each point of Luck can be expended to grant you a single 20-second extension for one Round per game session. Luck may also be expended in non-combat encounters.

NPC encounters are assigned an Ability score by the Storyteller, and a number of rounds to be endured before the NPC is defeated. 

Example:
Easy (Apprentice, Common Soldier): 2-5 Rounds
Difficult (Archmage, Noble Socialite): 10 Rounds 

NPCs may also have Luck.

Talking/social encounters may occur as combat, but with conversations being limited by time as combat is. Social Rounds are double the length of combat rounds.
```
<hr> 

## Final Testament

```
3-5 players. You play ordinary people, who are friends.

Shuffle a card deck (minus face cards).

LIFE

Character objectives:
*Be open about their life and emotions
*Entangle the characters socially and emotionally
*Reveal tiny unexplained Enigmas in their lives (record these)

Draw a card each. Go in order of face value, lowest first, to:
*Frame a scene where something happens to develop or transform your relationship with another character
*Draw two cards, discard one

DEATH

When your hand hits 13+, die.

Take turns to describe the funeral, a sentence at a time.

POSTMORTEM

The deceased becomes GM.

The GM’s objectives:
*Create a compelling, frightening conspiracy
*Make it threaten the characters
*Weave the Enigmas in

Start the clock at zero. The GM frames scenes and advances the clock if, in a scene:
*The characters work to resolve an Enigma
*The characters show fear 

When the clock reaches 13, the characters secretly choose one of the following:
*Go into hiding forever
*Risk death to crack the conspiracy
*Betray the others

GM: frame a final scene where the conspiracy is fully revealed.

If anyone betrayed, those who risked death are screwed. Describe what happens.

Anyone who survives narrates a short epilogue for themselves.

## The Tribe

```
A game for a GM and 4-6 players who play members of a stone-age tribe, hunting, finding shelter, and fending off attacks from rival tribes. 

All in-character dialogue must be spoken in the tribe's Tongue. Write a syllable on an index card each. All words in the Tongue must be formed from these syllables. 

To define a new word in the Tongue, declare the word in English. Roll. 
1-2: You fail to communicate. Nobody may attempt to define that word again.
3+: Pick a number of the syllables equal to at least its  English syllables to form the new word, and write it on an index card. Everyone can now use it.
5+: Also define a new syllable.

When you attempt something new, e.g. making a spear, or creeping up on a wolf, roll.

1: this action is Taboo. You fail and nobody may attempt it again.
2-5: only you may attempt this action. 
6: all the Tribe may attempt this action.

To attempt a defined action, roll.

1-2: You fail. The GM will describe what complication arises.
3-5: you succeed, but the GM will describe a compilation or hard choice.
6: you succeed.

## Homeward Going: A Rlly Wow Travel

```
Your humans accidentally left you when they moved across the big city!  They wouldn’t do it on purpose, you’ve been such a good dog!  You and your friends must travel to find them!

Make a dog!  Describe and name them.  There’s two stats: Good-Dog! and Bad-Dog!  Divide 6 points between them.  All dogs communicate telepathically with each other.

Have a facilitator- they play all the humans, describe the world and set challenges for you dogs.  They always ask “what do you do?”

If an outcome is unclear, roll 2d6.  On a 10+ it happens how you say, on a 7-9 it happens, but there’s a consequence, on a 6- it goes bad or sideways.  Humans are unpredictable!

You can spend points from a relevant stat to increase your outcome, but one stat flips each time.  I spend +2 from good dog to get 10+!  YASS!  But Good-Dog! goes down one and Bad-Dog! goes up one.  Outside world is hard!

If either stat hits 0, you give up.  Too mean or too soft, cya doggie!  If a human calls you a Good-Dog! or a Bad-Dog! increase that stat.  The facilitator will do this on 6- sometimes.

Find your humans!

## Fire of the Gods

```
Introduction
Long ago, Divinity left the world; the gods disappeared. But that Fireremained in their bloodlines, and it has been rekindled.
What will you do with the power of a god?
Divinity
The GM frames the world with two simple questions:
When will the game start?
When did Divinity return?
Narrate your god's description and background; all gods are exceptional. Choose a Realm, assign 5 points between Mundane (operating as a mortal) and Divine (operating as a god), minimum 1 point. Also start with 5 Numina (the divine Fire).
Gameplay
Divine always trumps Mundane; chance is only for similar forces. Divinecan be used within a god's Realm, or when Numina is spent. Players roll dice, taking 2d6- one fortune and one fate. Roll, subtracting fate from fortune, adding stat, and optionally Numina.
> 0: Player narrates.
< 0: GM narrates.
= 0: Player narrates, GM narrates price.
Each use of Divine gives the GM Fate, which can be spent anytime to subtract one from a roll, narratively justified. Numina can be used to negate hits, but at 0 Numina, the next hits cause tremendous stress on the god's body; the GM will keep you posted.

Each PC is a Ghost whose job is to complete their unfinished business and move on. Death (the GM) can only take one of you, so you must advance your goals, while trying to sabotage the others. 

Step One: Pick Your Unfinished Business
1. Comfort a Loved One
2. Revenge of Your Murder
3. Secret that Must Be Told

Step Two: Create World and Objectives
Collaboratively work with Death to create what goals will enable each PC to move on. As you create these goals, build out the world and backstory all of you unhappy haunts will inhabit. 

Step Three: Ghost Moves
As Ghosts, you can only impact the world in three ways: 
- Move small objects 
- Whisper into the wind
- Appear in a reflective surface(s)

Use these moves to either complete your unfinished business or to sabotage your fellow ghosts. 

Step Four: There Can Only Be One
Once a Ghost completes their Goal, the game ends, the cunning Ghost has Moved On.

## WAR and FAITH

```
Empires are built through WAR and FAITH.

Needed for Play:
A “Deity” Character
2+ “Monarch” Characters
Followers (Paper Balls)
2d6
Matches

Monarchs all have unique names for “Deity” and design a prayer for tribute. Monarchs start with 6 paper followers.

Begin PRAYER ROUND: Monarchs perform their prayers and offer tributes to the Deity. During each prayer round, Monarchs vie for the Deity's blessing. Deity decides favorite prayer each round and grants winning monarch a BOON. 

BOON grants monarch one follower and power to roll 2d6.

If 2d6’s roll over follower count, go to WAR:
Roll 1d6. Limited by one match, set fire up to this many of other Monarch’s followers. All collateral damage is fair in WAR.

If 2d6 roll under follower count, build FAITH: 
Roll 1d6. Gain this many FAITHful followers.

If doubles roll, Fate sends PROPHET npc. Reroll 2d6’s:

If less than original roll, CRUSADE: Sacrificially burn no less than half of own followers.

If rolled over/equal to original roll, MISSION: Consume all followers of another Monarchy.

Monarchs are beheaded after losing all followers. 

Behead all other monarchs, burn heretics, gain followers and vie for Deity's love. Last monarch alive is crowned Emperor.

## Carfax Abbey

```
Do you love aristocratic family drama but feel it needs more bloodsuckers? Or do you fancy gothic horror but believe it would be improved with the addition of servants and scandals? Then mash them together in the setting for this gothic aristocratic vampire drama: Carfax Abbey.

Set at Count Dracula’s English residence, the game asks players to imagine Dracula (and associated characters) as part of a family of nobles—or their servants.

Players choose characters from those featured in either Dracula or a beloved period drama. Mix them up! See how Renfield would do as the resident cook, or picture the family matriarch as one of Dracula’s brides.

The GM then presents the players with a situation inspired by both sources. Some stories can come from one source, some from the other, but the really fun ones will likely be a blend. Sure, Dracula knows how to handle a group of hunters arriving to stake him—but what will he do when the chauffeur gets his granddaughter pregnant? How will the butler handle things when visitors from Transylvania show up and turn out to be messy, bloody eaters?

Players then resolve the story with dialogue, drama, scandal, and horror.

## The Trial

```
Someone must have slandered you, for one morning, without having done anything truly wrong, you were arrested.

Select one player to be the Accused. The Accused is not entitled to know their crime and must struggle to preserve their dignity. Remaining players are Accusers who oppose or support the Accused by playing their family and friends, and members of the oppressive court system.

Starting Coins:
Accused- 5*Players
Accuser- 5
Bank- 5

The Bank is hidden to the Accused but accessible to Accusers. Accusers may steal from the Bank. If the Accused correctly announces the theft, they receive the stolen coins. If the accusation is false, the Accused pays one coin to the Bank.

Take turns framing scenes from the Accused's life, beginning with the arrest. If a scene ends favourably for a character, their player may gift the Judge, a non-player entity, up to three coins. If disagreements arise, simultaneously bid coins. Highest wins narrative control, but must yield their bid to the Bank. Losing players may pay their bid to negotiate details of the scene. When all players are without coins, the Trial begins. The player who gifted the most coins to the Judge narrates the Trial's outcome.

## Jump!

```
Required: poker deck, d10

Your interdimensional ship is broken and you have no control over your destination. You must fix it with local materials.

Shuffle, lay deck face-down. Take turns clockwise.

On your turn:
Turn over the top card. Describe a detail of this world:
	Clubs: botanical.
	Diamonds: geological.
	Hearts: zoological.
	Spades: dangerous.

On a number card, roll.
If you roll:
Higher, keep the card as a success. What have you found?

Equal, you’ve found a crucial component! Set these aside.

Lower, discard as failure.

1, critical failure! Describe the setback. Next player must address it.

On a face card, you must negotiate with a local. Narrate or role-play this.

Jack(11): Devil’s bargain. Win, but treat the next failure as if they rolled 1. If they did roll 1, lose highest-value success instead. Describe how.

Queen(12): Judgement. If you have more successes than failures, win. Otherwise, lose. If equal, judgment postponed until after next turn.

King(13): Winning requires a sacrifice. What is asked of you? Is it worth it?

When combined successes equal 20, any player may jump the party to a new world. Reshuffle, excluding crucial components. Start over.

Win: jump with 5 crucial components.

## Bearing Witness

```
From the rooftop bar of a hotel in a city at war, foreign journalists gather to watch the show. They drink through press conferences and swap stories about the things they’ve seen, draft articles for the folks back home, and try to make sense of the absurdities of war.

Together, briefly describe the place you’re in and the conflict that’s brought you there. Consider the sides and what they’re fighting for, and its effects on the city and the country.

Each of you is a foreign journalist from a different country and/or publication. Think about who you are and who your audience is, then describe yourself to the others.

One of you begins by sharing a story. It could be a draft of your next article, a photograph, an anecdote. Make it tragic, or comic; biting, or reverent; extraordinary, or everyday; cynical, or optimistic. Others can interrupt with feedback or commentary. Remember your sources, and your audience.

When the story is finished, everyone talks about it; relate it to the conflict, give your perspective. When ready, another player shares another story. Consider skipping forward days or weeks, after things have changed. Repeat, until your war is over.
