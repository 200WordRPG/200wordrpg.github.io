## Fatimah's Busy Day

```
{} + () () () ...

The youngest player is Fatimah.  

Others play her anthropomorphic burqa, Amir.  

Fatimah is running errands before going on a trip.  

Using the prompts below as guidelines, play out scenes from Fatimah’s day.

[Open-Air Market], [Alleyways]

Fatimah’s world is blue-tinted, because Amir is blue, but Amir can see its true colors.  Amir, describe these to her as she travels, highlighting details that her screened saccades miss.  

[Open-Air Market], [Alleyways], [Mosque]

Fatimah’s world is dangerous, because people are desperate and violent, but Amir protects her from harm.  Amir, tell how you turn away gazes, camouflage her movements, and render her invisible to potential bad actors.  

[House], [Graveyard], [Alleyways]

Fatimah’s friends and family are in turmoil, because the world is bleak.  They are upset that she is going away.  They grasp at Fatimah.  Amir, tell Fatimah how they feel, but be mindful of her feelings, too.

Whenever Amir speaks, everyone talks all at once.  Through the noise, Fatimah chooses which narratives to silence, one by one, by saying “Hush...” and the speaker’s name.  The remaining narrative(s) become what is real.  When ready, Fatimah can silence everyone—and just exist—before ending the scene.

End play when Fatimah leaves for her trip.

## Quarantine

```
Two players, d8.

You are siblings trapped in a quarantine zone, just like everyone else in town. The military stopped bringing food ages ago. You tried rationing but there is none left. 
You have Things: mouldy potatoes, expired spam, dog treats, shoes, houseplants, your dog, cellar rats, and each other. 
Number of Things you have left is your Stamina. You have a shared pool of 8 Hope. Take turns Scavenging. 

Discuss options together. Try Scavenging or eat a Thing, then describe tonight's meal. 

To Scavenge, roll d8 against Stamina. If you rolled-under describe an act of violence you witnessed that was worse than anything you ever saw. Return empty-handed and lose 1 Hope. Otherwise roll again. You return with food, but if you rolled-over describe an inhumane act you committed to get it that was worse than anything you ever did and lose 1 Hope. Share your story later or don't. 

On the third day, the military leaves. On the sixth, your neighbour's house is raided. On the ninth you see people eating bodies. On the twelfth chaos reigns.

Starve when there's no meal. Commit suicide when there's no Hope. Survive for two weeks and be rescued.

## Magic for Sanity

```
You have made infernal pacts for spells, but casting spells reduces your humanity. To make a character, you select a number that ranges from two to twelve. You also decide upon one of the five elements as a specialty: wood, metal, fire, water, or earth. The higher the number, the stronger your magic. Whenever you cast a spell, you succeed if the result of 2d6 is less than/is your number. Whenever you want to do anything involving common sense or social interaction, you succeed if the result of 2d6 is more than/is your number. Whenever you roll a two, you increase your number by one. When your number is twelve and you roll a two, you’ve been driven insane by your eldritch revelations and must make a new character to continue playing. When you cast a spell related to your element, your number is increased by two while casting that spell.
The referee creates/maintains the world and its inhabitants, except players. It is the referee’s job to adjudicate the world’s reaction to the players. The referee obeys the following rules, in order of importance:
     -Give players choices
     -Keep players interested
     -Remain impartial
     -Propel the narrative
     -Keep secrets
```
<hr> 

## Dreamcard

```
You play a shared dream

there are 4 segments of dreams. logical, illogical, real and surreal. 
When you start a game every player writes two cards from each of this segments, this could be a word or sentence even a drawing or painting. The youngest player start with „suddenly i fall in the void where all dreams are born and...“ then he plays his first card and tells what happened. The other players can play there cards after 5 sentences the player says(he may talk more and maybe no one wants to interrupt him but he must have at least 5 sentence where no one interrupts him).
The rule for playing cards is simple, if the current  card is logical or real you only can play surreal or illogical. The game ends with the last card and the last sentence start with „and in the last moment before i lived again i...“ and ends with „and then i wake up“

## Healthcare

```
You’re doctors. Every session there’s a patient.
Doctors must read and swear to uphold the Hippocratic Oath.
Shuffle standard playing cards. Each doctor draws 12 cards, selects one, adds it to hand, and passes the rest to the left. Repeat process until doctors have 12 cards in hand.
Clubs: Intelligence, diagnoses, analysis.
Diamonds: Prestige, procedures, money.
Hearts: Humanity, talking, morality.
Spades: Chance, revelations, hope.
Value 2-14: Difficulty
    Example: Doctor talks to patient to find out more, and GM sets the difficulty as Hearts-8.
    To accomplish something, doctors draw 5 cards from hand, and use them to total the value or higher in that suit, using as few cards as possible. Discard after. When 5 cards aren’t in hand, shuffle discard into new hand.
Doctors may break the Hippocratic Oath, to automatically succeed (1/Session). After, if they:
Think it was better than failure. -Spade, +Club.
Don’t care. -Heart, + Diamond.
Can’t justify it. -Diamond, +Heart.
Believe nothing could be done. -1 Club, +1 Spade.



Doctors earn 1 experience when:
They fail.
Patients die.
They learn.
They uphold the Hippocratic Oath (1/Session).
    Doctors add one card of a chosen suit (randomly determined value) to their hand when they reach 4 experience.

```
<hr> 

## Carry On

```
Every player writes two or three encounters on note cards and places them in the center.

Pick a captain.  

The others claim an officer position (Gunnery, Crew, Navigation, Science) and one to three dice from the pool.  

The captain describes the mission, ship and an opening scene. 

The players may RP freely. 

Eventually an officer picks an encounter and describes the scene. The captain decides the course of action (who rolls) but should allow the officers to advise.  Any officer who supported the choice may contribute a +1.

Roll Results:  the rolling officer...
10+: describes the successful outcome.
7-9: picks a new encounter and describes how the scene changes.
6-: describes the failure.  Another officer must sacrifice one of their dice and describe how they fix the situation.  The captain picks if there is no volunteers.

The ship is lost if all dice are sacrificed.

Free RP resumes.

The mission ends after all officers have picked or there are no more encounters.  

The captain may praise or critique any officer he wishes in their final report.  

Dice Pool = 2xPlayers

Example Encounter: 
A privateer frigate following in our wake.
An alien artifact attaches to the ship!
Mutiny!
Distress signal!
Sabotage!
```
<hr> 

## Whip

```
Two characters, stuck in a tense argument, too stupid to just stop and make up. Consider: angry lovers, unpleasant coworkers, jealous friends, bitter siblings, etc. Spend ten minutes fleshing out their relationship and naming the big problem you’re here talking about now.

Take turns – on your turn, accuse or say something about their character that they couldn’t possibly ignore. If they wish to respond, they have to suffer actual physical pain (the form of that pain is up to the two of you: smacks, shocks, riding crops) to the player before doing so. They may then take a turn, accusing or saying something of you, and if you wish to retaliate, you must also suffer that pain. Continue until one of you refuses. Shoot for spiteful, petty, inflammatory things, and angle it so that if you would just shut up and apologize, this would all go away.

Each player may refuse once for free, abandoning that argument then starting a new related one. Once all refusals are used up and someone refuses to suffer pain, they get to say what their character does or says instead and how it impacts the relationship. It probably won’t be great.

## BoneRPG

```
You are a SKELETON, and you have been animated by your GAME MASTER to complete a mission.

You only have one SKILL, and one ITEM.

Whenever the GM deems your TASK hard enough, you must roll a D6.

In order to succeed, you need to roll a 5 or more.
When using your SKILL or ITEM, you need to a roll a 3 or more.

SKELETONS can’t die, but they can lose LIMBS. When you fail a TASK, lose a LIMB.
You can also sacrifice a LIMB before rolling to automatically succeed a TASK.

Draw your SKELETON on a piece of paper, and tear off a LIMB when you lose it in game.
1-SKULL
1-SPINE
1-LEFT ARM
1-RIGHT ARM
1-LEFT LEG
1-RIGHT LEG
Example
A SKELETON with no RIGHT LEG or LEFT LEG attempts to steal a car.

(They roll a 5, succeeding.)

They successfully break the window, and unlock the door, then get in the driver seat.

However, with no legs, they cannot reach the accelerator or brake pedals!

As you lose LIMBS you will need to become more creative in your solutions to the TASKS that you face.

## The Deep Dark

```
The Deep Dark -
The Deep Dark is a dungeon delving game for three players. It uses 2d6 for all resolution. 7+ is a success, 6- is a failure.

Each player is either a:
Cartographer - Finds ways through dungeon
Quartermaster - Keeps group supplied.
OR
Man-at-Arms - Defends group.

The group begins with 4 torches and 5 HP and may choose:
Map - +1 to one Exploration test
Torch - +1 Torch
OR
Sword - +1 to one Combat test

The game proceeds in phases, beginning with Exploration. The players are then free to move between Exploration and Camp as necessary.

Exploration tests Cartographer: 7+ finds uncharted room, 6- gets Lost.
        	-Lost: Subtract 1 Torch and Combat encounter!

Camp: Choose to Explore (move to Exploration) or Scavenge. 
Scavenging tests Quartermaster: 12 finds +1 sword or map, 7+ finds +1 Torch, 6- combat encounter!

Combat tests Man-at-arms: 7+ Victory; 6- Defeat (lose 1 HP).

Narrating – Before a player may roll the dice they must first narrate their character’s actions. How do they go about exploring, scavenging, or fighting?

The goal is to explore the entire dungeon by succeeding at 9 Cartographer tests before the group runs out of torches or HP.

## Zone-side Picnic

```
Inspired by the Stalker video games and Arkady and Boris Strugatsky’s book, Roadside Picnic.

Create a group text conversation with all other players.  

To play, take your phone to a park or other safe public area.  Go by yourself and avoid contact.  

If you see another person, text the group describing the encounter.  This person may be a native of the zone or another stalker hunting for artifacts.  Narrate the encounter however you wish.  

Share pictures with the group of any animals (creatures), strange debris (artifacts), structures or artwork (anomalies).  

When you are ready to leave the zone, pick up an artifact near an anomaly, preferably litter.  You may dispose of it properly at the edge of the zone.  Brag to the group about your big score.

If you spot another player in a zone, avoid, follow or confront them.  The first player to point at the other has the upper hand.  They may offer terms, take an artifact, “disarm”, “kill”, or “co-operate”.  

Disarmed players may not point at anyone till morning.

Dead players may not point at others, gather artifacts or message the group till morning.

Co-operating players may not point at the other till morning.

Get out alive!
```
<hr> 

## The world is ending

```
The world as we know it is ending. Nobody knows why, but some destruction signals like earthquakes and plagues are happenings.

Playing N persons, each player writes on paper N-1 apocalyptic disasters (e.g. plague) and a list with N+1 resources for surviving (e.g. packed food). Additionally, each player writes on paper a root cause for the end of the world (military virus, drought, etc.).

One by one, each player chooses one apocalyptic disaster on his paper and narrates it to one of the other players (trying to assign one disaster to each player along the game). Then, the chosen player must narrate how he survives the disaster using the resources in his paper. If he need an additional resource he can talk and negotiate with other player to exchange one resource by another. If the player is not able to overcome the disaster he must give one of the resources to the player that narrated the disaster.

When all the disasters have been narrated, the player with more resources (survived more times) wins and narrates how he discovers the root cause of the apocalypses (the cause he wrote) and how he stops it (or not).

## Shopkins Party

```
Grab four Shopkins for each player in the game and put them in a bag.

The youngest players draws a Shopkin from the bag. Everyone should say, “Happy Birthday!” Today is this Shopkin’s birthday party! On a sheet of paper write down her name. Place the Shopkin on the table: she’s waiting for her friends to arrive.

The player to the right draws another Shopkin from the bag. The first guest has arrived! Write her name down and flip a coin: on heads the guest is one of the birthday girl’s best friends forever; on tails she is a mean bully. Note this down. The players now act out a scene involving the party goers. If the birthday girl stands up to a bully during a scene the bully is now one of her best friends forever.

Continue to draw guests till you have drawn half your Shopkins. The next Shopkin drawn is the birthday girl’s mom. She’s got the cake. Everyone sing Happy Birthday!

Each Shopkin drawn after this point is someone’s mom. They are here to pick up their kid. Make sure they leave with a loot bag!

## Secret Hearts

```
The fey are ancient, unwavering.

The GM plays the mortal supplicants. They describe who challenges the Fey court. The supplicant secretly selects a die size each scene, representing the magnitude of their quest, and rolls it.

D2-D4-D6-D8-D10-D12-D20

2-4 Fey take a colour wheel each to show their secret heart. 
Each takes a D6, D8, and D12 and secretly assigns them a colour.

Red-Anger.
Yellow-Joy.
Blue-Sadness.
Orange–Excitement.
Green-Fear
Purple-Loathing

The Fey are capricious. Before the supplicant approaches, each Fey picks one colour/emotion.

Play out the scene. The supplicant arrives. The Fey must decide whether to grant their request while channelling their chosen emotion.

Once an outcome is decided, each Fey in turn is subject to a vote.

All participants vote the colour the Fey has represented. If a majority match the Fey’s chosen colour, that Fey may roll their dice against the supplicant. Otherwise their die is diminished, dropping to the next lowest size.

Rolling less than the mortal diminishes your die, and switches it to a complimentary colour.
Rolling greater than the mortal increases your die and switches it to the contrasting colour.

If increasing an emotion above D20, Fey are overwhelmed.
If dropping below D2, they fade.

```
<hr> 

## Divine Circles: Kingdom in Decline

```
The Angels’ Patrons have lost Faith, so sayeth the Lord; In the beginning, there were two (or more). One was God. The Rest; Angels.

Angels speaketh their Domain: “I am the Angel of...”; Method: “I rule my Domain using...”; and Patron: “...is my most trusted Patron.” Assign one die to each: D4+2, D8, D12-2.

God influences Patrons, who influences Methods, which influences Domains, which influences God.

Angels roll their Patron die, then Method die. Subtract Patron from Method to determine Faith. If Faith is negative, God decrees the Patrons hinder the Domain; if positive they help the Angel.

Angels roll Domain, then narrate using Method to restore Glory to their Domain. Angels must either; Accept Faith for their roll, or Divert Faith to God or another Angel. If Faith results in the Domain roll becoming negative the Angel experiences a divine complication. An Angel receiving Diverted Faith must Accept it. Add final results to Glory.

Faith Diverted to God is summed and used to influence Patron rolls; negative Faith increases Patron rolls. Play continues starting with the Angel with the highest Glory.

If any Angel’s Glory goes negative, their Domain plunges into chaos and they fall from grace.
```
<hr> 

## FALLEN STARS

```
FALLEN STARS

2-4 players, 1 GM, deck of 52 cards

Your Empress has been killed and the Empire seized by traitors. As her Avatars, greater than mortals, you must deliver vengeance upon the Usurper. Each player selects a unique Virtue:

Glory (Clubs)
Honour (Spades)
Justice (Diamonds)
Passion (Hearts)

Each player draws six cards then discards two. Players’ cards are kept private. 

Play takes place in four phases.

During the Raid phase players will strike to gather intelligence and material. During the Retaliation phase the traitors strike back. Players then Rally their own forces and commit them to the Revenge against the Arch-Traitor.

The GM establishes a scene. Each player describes their actions, placing one card from their hand face down. The GM then draws one card face up to indicate the opposition. 

Players reveal their cards, then describe the outcomes of their actions in order of lowest value card to highest. A player with a higher card than the opposition has succeeded. A player succeeds on a tie if their card matches their Virtue. 

Begin the next phase when all actions are resolved. 

Play to discover the cost of revenge.

## Ablative Soldiers

```
The players are cybernetic shock troopers manufactured by the lowest bidder. They have access to nearly any technology available, but all of it is single-use and must be discarded from their body after use.

A storyteller provides the mission the troopers must complete. Each player tracks their body components. Challenges can be resolved by either simple d100 rolls against the storyteller's difficulty, opposed d100 rolls, or troopers can sacrifice off an appropriate body part to succeed automatically and explain what the tech does to help them. The storyteller may decide the body part must be bigger to accomplish the goal, particularly if weaponry is involved. A fingertip may not have an explosive big enough to clear a room, but a foot, or a leg, may be able to. Players cannot use the same body part twice, and must track which parts have been used as the mission goes along. Players may exchange parts with each other, or salvage them from fallen cyborgs if they come across any.

If victorious, the players get to retire to a proper, durable cyborg body. Failure means their slowly shrinking shells waste away in the mission zone.

<hr> 

## Ghost Estate

```
Idioms are made flesh in the reality fractured Irish village of Ballynagopaleen. 

You are spirits squatting in a ghost estate in the, otherwise typical, village. Describe yourselves, when and how you died, and what's left unfinished in your previous lives. Completing those tasks (however metaphorically) allows your spirits to pass on - your ultimate goal.

You have two pools: SPOOKY for spectral actions, & NOGGIN to interpret the modern world.
			
	Dead (years)		     SPOOKY		     NOGGIN
	===========================================
		1		        	1			           5
		10			        2			           4
		50			        3			           3
		100			        4			           2
		500+			5			           1

One action costs one point. Resolve competitions with a D6, modify rolls with points.

Points refresh by "invoking" new idioms (once per idiom). Describe how that idiom manifests and cope with it - many will turn sinister. You are permanently banished to limbo if both pools zero-out.

Idioms emerge during play or when the GM rolls on the:

	Random Idiom Encounter Table (extend / amend / localise as desired):
	======================================================
	"Celtic Tiger" - green, stripy, tooth and claw, successful attacks drain points
	"Raining cats and dogs" - plummeting pets
	"Christ on a bike" - wheelie based messianism
	"Hungry grass" -  vicious landscaping
	"Chance your arm" - roll those bones, risk your pool
	"Story horse" - distracting narrative equine

## Valor: The Dimming Flame

```
Valor: The Dimming Flame is an RPG about Paladins refusing temptation and darkness within themselves.

Each player is a Paladin; a devolt holy warrior. Each paladin begins the game with 7 resolve.
The GM is temptation. Giving instances of corruption and bravery to the weathered souls of the paladins.

Every challenge the GM gives a paladin tests the resolve of these knights. A test is taken by rolling 2d6. On a result of 8 or greater the paladin accomplishes a task. If either d6 rolls a 1, a resolve point is ripped away from that paladin. At zero resolve, the paladin falls from grace and into darkness, no longer able to walk the path with the rest of the paladins. 

Paladins can push their resolve, adding a third d6 to a task after a failed result at the cost of one resolve. If the third d6 rolls a 1, additional resolve is not lost. 

A paladin can possibly restore lost resolve by achieving heroic deeds or by praying. A paladin can pray once per day by rolling 1d6. On a 5 or greater one resolve is restored to the worn warrior.

## Our Last Summer

```
You play adolescents sneaking off on adventure.
Materials: 1 small bag of M&Ms.
Players pick a nickname and three things their character is good at.

Each player describes their preparations and the home they are leaving.
Then everyone plays out the trip and the GM introduces obstacles. 

To overcome obstacles each player describes their actions and grabs an M&M from the bag. 
RED: Failure, you get hurt.
YELLOW: Failure, you get scared.
ORANGE: Success + weather gets worse.
GREEN: Success + animals are more dangerous.
BLUE: Success + grownups are more dangerous.
If your character is good at their action you may grab two and eat one. Next obstacle you cannot use this rule.
If there are more failures than successes the GM grabs 3 M&Ms and narrates how they fail. Otherwise they overcome the obstacle.
Place all grabbed M&Ms in a pile.

After an obstacle one player can set a scene where they tell the others what sucks in their character’s life, then eat two pile M&Ms. Take turns.

If the pile ever has more than 5 of a color, play a bad ending based on the color.
If the bag is emptied play a good ending.

## Chirognomy

```
Delve into a nostalgic dreamland to revoke your biggest regret from the Tarot.

CASTING DICE

Cast some d6 equal to your the most relevant score, keeping exactly two, versus the gamesmaster's d12.  Do you succeed?
- I scored lower: NO, AND things worsen
- I scored higher: YES, BUT things complicate
- We match: YES AND the dreamland alters in your favour

STATTING YOUR SHADOWSELF

You have four scores: ambition, responsibility, creativity, communication.  Each begins at value 2.

Consult your non-dominant palm; look for the biggest gap between your fingers:
- First and second: confident, increase ambition and responsibility by 2 each.
- Second and third: responsive, increase responsibility and creativity by 2 each.
- Third and final: independent, increase creativity and communication by 2 each.
- Negligible difference: practical, increase all values by 1.

Next, decide:
- Head line: What is your biggest achievement?
- Heart line: What are you afraid of?
- Life line: To whom do you owe your life?

Finally, reduce any one of your scores by 1.

DENIZENS OF DREAMLAND

You seek the Major Arcana personality numbered as the time now according to the 24h clock.  Denizens of the dreamland roll 2d12 and take the highest; Tarot personalities roll 4d12 and take the highest.

## Lawsuits & Litigators

```
A PBTA rule making mini-game for use with other games.

Trial:
PC: make up a rule you want. Invent a story about an NPC victimized because this rule doesn’t exist. Grandstand!

 GM/DM: Expose how this person wasn’t victimized! Add to the story! Grandstand!
PC: Roll 2d6:
10+ jury finds for you! The rule lasts for 1 session pending appeal.
7-9 you lose, but preserve error and appeal.
6- you lose, failed to preserve error and cannot appeal. Also, you can no longer go to trial.

Appeal:
GM/DM and PC: One at a time, explain in sedate tones why the rule is bad(GM/DM) or good(PC). First to go gets rebuttal. Players should interrupt with obtuse questions.
PC: Roll 2d6: 
10+You win, Supreme Court (SC) denies cert. Rule is permanent.
7-9 appeal finds for you, but SC grants cert. Rule lasts 3 sessions pending cert.
6- you lose, and SC denies cert. 

Cert:
Same procedure as Appeal, but all the players add archaic rules to how you can talk.
PC rolls 2d6:
10+ SC affirms. The rule is permanent!
7-9 SC plurality. The rule has a strange limitation.
6- SC reverses. The rule goes away.

## SUPERHERO RPG

```
Players are superheroes defending a neighborhood/city/country/planet from evil and disaster.
They have 6 stats: Strength, Speed, Toughness, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
Stats are ranked either F, D, C, B, A, or S
The rankings correspond to the following dice:
F: d4
D: d6
C: d8
B: d10
A: d12
S: d20
Any time the player attempts to do something non-trivial they roll a die corresponding to the stat corresponding to the task. If the number is high enough (as determined by the GM) they succeed, if not, they fail.
A player can have up to 2 S rank stats, 3 A, and 1 B if they have no other powers.
During character creation players can design their own powers; the GM will determine how much they must lower their base stats to acquire the power.
Upon completing enough heroic actions, the GM may let the players level up, either by gaining more powers, higher ranks, or upgrading their current powers.
All things like player death, health, or complex combat will be up to the discretion and creativity of the GM. Creativity > Giant Rules Section

## Melody & Memories

```
Magic is real, and relies on music. When we need to act outside of our realm, we use nostalgia.

You need a pack of cards.

Note your character’s Name and Instrument. Pick a Truth:
	
	I am (SMART / STRONG / SOCIAL).

A Tunekeeper has been murdered. Decide on their name together.

Take turns answering about the Tunekeeper:
	How did you meet?
	What Melody did they teach you, and what does it do?
	What is the kindest thing they did for you?

You’ve gathered to find the person who did this. Pick one to answer each.
	What is their name?
	What do they look like?
	What Instrument do they play?
	How did they kill the Tunekeeper?
	Where are they now?

Some of these will be true, GM decides.

When you act outside your realm, draw 4 cards. Draw an extra card for each if they help: Melody, Instrument, Truth, Name. Choose 4 of your cards.
	4 RED: You have succeeded.
	3 RED: There is a consequence, but you succeed.
	ANYTHING ELSE: You fail.

If you fail, pick:
	You lose a Melody.
	You lose your Name.
	You lose your Instrument.
	You lose your Truth.

If you have none left, you die.

## The Goblin Warrens

```
A band of goblins must defend their lair against bloodthirsty adventurers.

SETUP

Each player chooses five d6s, representing their five goblins. Specialties are based on die color: Blue for brawn (strength and endurance), green for guile (cunning and alertness), and anything else for agility (speed and stealth).

TRAIT CHECKS

Trait checks involve a trait (brawn, guile or agility), and a difficulty number that players must equal or exceed.

Each player rolls 1-3 of their surviving goblin dice, using the highest roll to determine success. Failure means their lowest rolling goblin dies. One goblin also dies on a double, or two on a triple.

If the trait matches a goblin’s specialty, the player may reroll that die, keeping the new result.

COMBAT

Adventurers are represented as colored d8s, and classified as fighters (brawn), wizards (guile) or rogues (agility). Combat is a standard trait check, except an adventurer die is rolled with the goblin dice to determine the trait and difficulty (1-8). The adventurers must be fought until defeated.

ADVENTURE

An adventure has five scenes, narrated by the GM. The first four require a trait check with a random trait and difficulty. The final scene involves fighting the adventurers (one per player).

## Tyrze, a MMORPG

```
“Tyrze” is a MMORPG.  The land of Tyrze has different zones populated by different races. Human, dwarf, and elf are the common races. There are also zones for giants (cyclops, hill, stone, frost, fire, and Titan), reptile (lizardman, naga, gorgon, basilisk, drake, dragon), demi-human (goblin, orc, ogre, troll, imp, and Demon), shapeshifters (catperson, minotaur, centaur, treant, sphinx, and Doppleganger), and undead (skeleton, zombie, ghost, werewolf, vampire, and Lich). Each race has class restrictions. There is a level cap of 100. Every time your character completes 20 levels, he may continue leveling that character, or start over at level 1 in the same zone with a more powerful character. For example, if your skeleton reaches level 20, he may swap to a 1st level zombie. If your zombie reaches level 40, you may skip ghost, and go straight to 1st level werewolf. The zones are in constant battle with each other. One town in each zone is neutral and populated by NPC’s. I believe a game like this would foster community, and also allow players to become boss monsters who can try to ransack other towns. I have many details for this game if you’re interested.

## Performance Issues

```
An actor portrays a multitude of characters in their career. What if they were recruited into a mercenary team together? It’s like the Expendable where the whole team is composed of multiple Stallones, or Arnolds, or...

WHAT YOU NEED
2-3 players (GM optional)
1d6 per player

MECHANICS
Players choose 3 characters from TV or Film who were portrayed by a single actor. (Eg. Eddie Murphy: Axel Foley, Prince Akeem, Pluto Nash)
Designate each character to an even and odd number. (Eg. 1-2=Axel Foley, 3-4=Prince Akeem, 5-6=Pluto Nash).
Describe the story. Meditate actions (combat or not) with dice rolls — roll a d6 to determine if you succeed with awesome (on Evens) or fail with humor (on Odds). (Optional rule: Never tell them the Odds. Just tell them how you fail.)
You can “flip your roll” to success if you impersonate the character in their actions or use a one-liner from their respective movies or television show.
Games can be cooperative or PVP against a foe or obstacle presented by the GM or other players.

## Flirt Party Aftermath

```
Flirt Party Aftermath
a supplement to Flirt Party - 20-50 players.
by Johannes Oppermann

The Talk

Everyone, think of your most intense past relationship. When you were sure what it was. Think of the talk you had before you were sure. Describe your situation on an index card. Be brief, but clear. Put all index cards in a hat. Mix, then draw one at random. This is your motivation. 

Partner up, take opposite seats at a long table. Like speed dating, but assume you’ve already met. You’re at a point where at least one of you wants an answer to the question “What is this between us?” 

Take 5 minutes with your partner, try to achieve your goal. After that, leave your card on the table, move one space left. Opposites, keep your seat, but pass your card to the left. Repeat until you’ve tried all cards.

Ice Cream & Breakups

Same as before, write on an index card. But this time, think of the time you broke up. Think of when you knew you would. Think of when you had the talk. Write your motivation. Then have the talk, as above. 

Now have some ice cream - you’re so brave, treat yourself!

## A Nice Meal (For Once)

```
5 people are going to have a holiday dinner. Decide on your ties to each other. Everyone starts with:  0 Forks, 3 Spoons, Spoon, a random power and random goal.

Powers:
Gain 1 Spoon when they are the only person pro- or anti-skub (nonsense argument)
May spend Spoon instead of Spoons to cook
Can spend 1 Spoon end an argument with no Spoon loss or gain

Goals:
have 5 Forks, 
have 5 Spoons, 
have 5 Spoon

Cook! 
Everyone can spend Spoons to make dishes, at least 5 dishes must be made total but any person can make however few or many they want.

Eat?
Go clockwise, you may either talk (spend 1 Spoon)  or eat (gain 1 Fork the person who made the dish gains 1 Spoon).
If you talk, flip a coin, you will be either pro - skub or anti skub. In 30 seconds say why. 

Argue!
If everyone agrees everyone gains a Spoon. 
If anyone disagrees 3 minutes of talk you may spend 1 Spoon to change your opinion. If people still disagree everyone loses a Spoon. 
If anyone has a 0 in any category for 2 rounds, the game is over and everyone loses.

## Good Morning Magicland

```
Build a silly fantasy world by roleplaying the hosts and guests on TV talk shows.

Choose one player to be the host of the first show. 

As a host, introduce your show’s name and topic. Possible topics: applied magic, gossip, food, travel, politics, sports, history, conspiracy, panel, infomercial, educational.

Introduce your first guest. Announce the guest’s name and relevant info (e.g. profession, type of magical creature); then point to a player to roleplay that guest. Players should cross their arms if they don’t want to be that guest.

The host and guest then play out the show. Ham it up and revel in ridiculousness, but don’t contradict the established fiction! The host can invite another guest to join the conversation, with the initial guest staying or leaving. If another player wants to chime in, they can pretend to be on the phone and the host can “take a call from the audience”.

When the topic loses momentum, the host should thank the guest(s) and end the show; aim for five minutes. Then, another player becomes host and introduces their show. 

Players can play different characters across shows or repeat characters.

Have fun and good luck with the ratings!

## Footprints

```
There is an other place.

It is called


You get there by



Print this on paper, fill in the blanks above, then redact this sentence.
Play one game of Footprints then give this document to other people to play.

Players create a character with a name, a belief, and stats: Quick, Strong, Hale, Smart, Odd, True. Give each stat a value between -1 and 3. Stats must total less than ten.

Together, tell a story where the characters enter the other place and what happens there. Players describe their characters’ actions, the GM describes all else. Rulings will sometimes be triggered which say what happens next. They start with a bang(!)

When playing the GM adds additional rulings and/or fictional elements to this document. They add between one and five. Add pages as needed.

!When a character is hurt, reduce their Hale by one.

!When a character’s Hale is less than one, they die.

!When a character attempts something non-trivial, roll 2d6 and add whichever stat the GM says applies. If the result is more than seven they succeed. If less than ten the success is partial or comes at a cost. Otherwise the GM says what happens.

## Trapped in Deep 7

```
“Catastrophic failure detected. Implosion imminent. Evacuate station.”

You’ve almost escaped the undersea lab when… SABOTAGE! You must repair the escape pod before time runs out.

Materials: 
	1 film canister per person
	Alka-Seltzer tablets
	Water
	Eye protection
	Small jigsaw puzzle
	
Everyone chooses a role:
	Captain: Gives orders, works canisters
	Scientists: Finds pieces
	Engineers: Places pieces

Act according to your role but only as the Captain directs. Working like this, solve the puzzle to repair the pod. If there is no one left to fill a role, you can share a role (e.g. if no Captain, a Scientist can take charge).

Each canister begins half full of water. 

Put half a tablet in one canister. Snap on the lid. Turn it upside down. GO! 

If you don't get the lid on right and water spills out, STOP. You don’t close an airlock correctly and drown.

When the canister explodes, STOP. Part of Deep 7 implodes from water pressure. If the canister hits you, a bolt comes loose from water pressure, flies across the room, and kills you.

Start another canister. GO!

If all the canisters explode before you solve the puzzle, Deep 7 implodes, killing everyone.

## Everyone's The Good Guy (Of Their Own Story)

```
Storytelling RPG for 2 Players

Two players each take turns narrating a scene or event across five time periods, one forward through time, the other backwards. During each narration, the other player can interject one fact which must be incorporated into the narration. Along with that fact, all other statements should be assumed a true if not unbiased view of events.
At the beginning of the game, write down one in-narrative concession you would like the other character to make. If they do so, you win. This means that one, the other, both, or neither players could “win”.

Scenario 1: The Relationship

This scenario plays out over a five year relationship, each being one member of the relationship, from its beginning to its end. The five scenes occur at the meeting phase, the early relationship, the height of the relationship, its downward spiral, and its dissolution, each roughly one year apart.

Scenario 2: The Mission

This scenario plays out over five hours of a failed military mission, both characters being officers in charge of the mission. The scenes are the planning phase, the initial engagement, an ongoing stalemate, starting to lose, and the tragic withdrawal.

## Gods among mortals

```
FROM THE RULER OF GODS TO THE GODS
“I sentence all of you to walk the earth. Far too long have you ignored the mortal realm. You will find your temples, avatars and worshipers all are forgotten or gone. 
You may try to escape your fate, alone you will not succeed. ”

TO THE GODS
Name? 
What are you god of? You may perform related actions without rolling. 
Anti-realm? You can’t perform related actions. 
Your avatar on earth? Last sighted?
Who worshiped you?
What do you look like? Then? Now?
Start: Mundane = 9, Godly = 50. 

When rolling: use a D100. 
If result under stat: Success. 
0-9: Triumph. 
90-99: Despair.

When performing non-trivial tasks fit for a mortal: roll Mundane. 
If fail: gain 1 Mundane.

When using your powers discreetly, indistinguishable from luck or tricks: roll Godly.

When performing a miracle: burn 10 Godly.

When Godly = 0: lose immortality.

When among worshipers: choose if rolls are against Mundane or Godly.

When a worshiper makes a major sacrifice in your name: gain 1D10 Godly.

When finding your avatar: Ascend.

TO THE RULER OF GODS
Challenge them, hide their avatars. 
Give them worshipers, take them away.
Give them hope, let the world be shaped.

## Birthday equilibrium

```
You all work in the same office. Go in order and introduce yourself. What kind of employee are you? Hardworking? Awkward? Unreliable?

The next person decides your position in the company - CEO, janitor or anything in between.

Oddly enough, you all have birthdays in the next few weeks. You can ask for one of the following:

1. Chocolate ($10)
2. Book ($30)
3. Whiskey ($60)
4. Game ($100)

Whichever you choose, you get $5 less (spent on wrapping paper) to invest on gifts for others.

Discuss gift ideas among yourselves. Plan carefully as there won’t be enough money for everyone. Luckily, you can take a vacation and skip one party.

Secretly write down your desired gift, whose party you’ll skip, and how will you divide your budget on others.

Celebrate birthdays in order. If you got the present you wanted - you get victory points (1 for a chocolate and up to 4 for a game). If attendants failed to raise enough money - each attendant loses 1 victory point. The winner is the person with the most points.

But.

If nobody comes to your birthday party - they’re all horrible people and they lose. You win but it’s a bitter victory.
```
<hr> 

## Situations & Explanations

```
Each player has a Player deck of 20 cards. They write one word on each. Each must: be a noun or verb, cannot be something overly ambiguous, and none can be synonyms or duplicates.

Each Player must also create 5-10 of each of the following: a Setting (a one word place like Dungeon, City), an Encounter (one adjective and noun; like Spiked Pit, Upset In-Law) and a Modifier that prevents certain cards from working (an adjective with explanation such as Angry (no Social cards), Disarmed (no items)). These are set into a pile for each that all players put theirs into.

Players shuffle their Player deck and draw 4 cards. Determine a Scene with one card from the Setting, Encounter, and Modifier decks. Each Player uses cards and explains how they’re used to get them through the Scene. Players can use their own cards to help others, and Players unable to pass a Scene are left behind. Used cards disappear. After a Scene is over, Players draw until they are up to 4 cards, and a new Scene is started.

Play continues until either there are no more Scenes (Victory!), or the players can do nothing more (Defeat).

## Group troop

```
The game starts with every player writing down a social group on a piece of paper. This can be anything, from "tango dancers" to "people who like white chocolate". Everyone picks a group note at random, and the game begins. From there everyone takes turns, starting with the oldest player present, stating a cliche or a trait they imagine people in their group share. So, if you've got tango dancers you might say "muscular calves", at which point anyone with a group who shares this trait repeats it, in this case that group might be football players. The game ends when each group has been identified and each group has matched traits with at least two other groups.

## Go Home, Young Superhero

```
2-3 players

One person plays a young superhero dealing supervillainy but also regular life. Give that player a deck of shuffled cards.

Other players GM our superhero’s dual life. Give them 2 black d6 (superhero adventures) and 2 red d6 (regular life).

Together, figure out who your young superhero is: name, alias, powers, friends, family, school, work, supervillains. Decide which supervillains are running amok and what trouble your hero is dealing with in regular life.

Hero starts with 6 cards. Other players start with one die at 3 (Tension), one at 6 (Countdown).

Each turn: 
Hero decides whether to deal with supervillainy or regular life troubles; draw card.

Increase Tension for situation not chosen. Reduce Countdown for chosen situation.

Responsible player GMs a scene about chosen situation. When outcome uncertainty arises, the hero plays cards to match or beat the current Countdown+Tension for success. Roleplay challenge result.

Cards that don’t match situation color are half value. Roleplay how hero uses real life skills to deal with supervillainy or superpowers real life.

Success= reduce that situation’s Tension.
Failure= Tension doesn’t change; draw 1 card.

A situation resolves if Tension is reduced to zero.

Game ends when a Countdown hits zero.

## DOGQUEST 1000

```
You are all dogs!
What kind of dog are you? 

>A GOOD DOG, with virtuous skills like public defending!
>A BAD DOG, with wicked skills like tax fraud!
>A PUPPER, with doggish skills like gamboling!

After deciding, describe yourselves in a few sentences.

What's the world like?  The world may be very different from our own, but dogs are a constant.

Tell us about your owner(s)!
They seem pretty swell! Each of you should say something about them! Write that all down.

Uh oh! Something's happened to them!
Decide as a group what misfortune awaits.

Got all that? It's time for an adventure!

***
Choose a player: they're the Troublemaker. They get to make trouble for the other puppies to solve! Once they solve or fail it, the player to their left becomes the new Troublemaker, and the old one resumes playing their dog! After everyone's made trouble at least once, a majority can vote to move to the Final Trouble.  As a group, choose a final Troublemaker to pose the last trouble between you and your owner(s)!

Win or lose, each player then describes a puppy epilogue! Going out for treats after is encouraged. 
```
<hr> 

## My Alibi

```
A crime has been committed. You are the primary suspect.

Who are you? What do you do? Where were you on the night of the crime?

Choose among the group who plays the dead man. The dead man writes in a piece of paper how he was murdered and incorporate items that serve as evidence to the crime equal to the number of suspects plus one. He keeps this safe. He then individually write each evidence item on blank cards, shuffles and deals three cards per suspect. 

Interrogation starts. Each suspect is given sufficient time to state alibis incorporating the three item cards. After all suspects are done, the group ranks each other’s alibi from strongest to weakest. 

The dead man then reveals the circumstances of his death, preceded by “This is how you killed me…”. Whoever has the murder weapon is the killer. If not voted as having the strongest alibi, he can alter his statement. The group decides his guilt. If he is not guilty or was voted to have the strongest alibi, the suspect with the weakest alibi is convicted for the crime. Whoever is convicted plays the role of the dead man on the next game.
```
<hr> 

## To Alex!

```
For 3-6 players, over drinks.

You just attended your complicated friend Alex’s funeral and are now drinking and telling Alex stories. 

Make three types of notecards with the following written on them:

Prompts:
-Almost arrested
-The big fight
-Best party ever  
-Childhood memory
-Getting lost
-Helping someone 

Inspiration:
-Favorite color
-Sad song
-Funny movie 
-Your shared place
-Comfy t-shirt
-Funny selfie

Complications:
-You know a secret
-You saw another side
-You have more information
-You saw the fallout
-Alex confessed something 
-You and Alex talked about it

You may add to these lists.

Each player draws 1 card of each type. On their turn, they use the “Prompt” and “Inspiration” cards to improvise a story about Alex. Other players may interject with questions, color, or comments. Players may play their complication card during another player’s turn to add a new dimension to the story.

After everyone’s turn, each player selects one of these prompts to conclude their reminiscing:
I’ll miss Alex because…
I loved Alex because…
I’m glad Alex...
I’ll never forgive Alex for…
I couldn’t understand why Alex…
I wish I would have told Alex...

The game ends with all players raising their glasses and toasting “to Alex!”

## The Town of M

```
Divide one bag of plain M&Ms into piles by color.

Give each player one color of M&Ms.

 
The player with the most M&Ms is the leader of the town.

The other players represent the diverse society of the town. Each player should describe three things that define their group.

 
The leader will divide their M&Ms into roughly three even piles representing Laws, Expectations, and Social Norms. The leader will take one M&M from any pile and make a declaration about the town that specifically oppresses one group of people.

The people can work together and fight back by “rolling” their M&M’s. Players may throw as many M&Ms they want on the table, any that land with the “M” face up are counted as a success. All rolled M&Ms are eaten.

If the players get enough successes they describe how they changed or subverted the declaration. Otherwise, the Leader’s declaration stands.

 
Successes needed

Laws:  One Success
Expectations: Two Successes
Social Norms: Three Successes

 
Repeat this process until the Leader has no remaining M&Ms then discuss as a group how your town would function with the society that was established.

## Show and Hell

```
A sunny Monday morning finds students beaming with excitement as they wait to share childhood treasures.  This morning's show and tell, though, is a bit off.  Unsettling photos, strange artifacts, and items best left in a police evidence locker wait to be displayed.

One player serves as the teacher, who opens a photo from a random image site at the beginning of each player's turn.  The player then launches into an excited discussion inspired by the photo she has received, going on and on with all of the wondrous excitement of a first grader as her macabre tale unfolds.

The teacher and the other students get to ask questions about the object.  Does the teacher try to glean the shocking truth about the object or desperately try to find some way to shift?  Are the other students overly enthusiastic and curious, or do their innocent questions show that they are just on the cusp of understanding the full horror of the object?

The game goes on until all of the students have had a turn sharing with the class.

## Harder, Better, Faster

```
Requires :


3 to 6 Players. One Player acts as the Mediator, responsible for handling the story flow and choice consequences.
1 die.
 


Your team is special. Everything others do, you do it a little better, and usually don’t fail.

Every time a Character does something important, choose 2 out of the 3 Values (normal Characters choose only 1):

 
      Harder: Every action has a cost. If you choose this, the cost is acceptable. If you don’t, sacrifices are needed.

      Better: The quality of your work. If you choose this, it’s top-notch.  If you don’t, it will create problems.

      Faster: How long it takes to finish it. If you choose this, it happens as fast as possible. If you don’t, it takes a lot longer (the whole scene, battle, session).
 

 
The Specialization Rule: You are really good at something, and at this you get all 3 Values. On the downside, you are bad at something, and at this you can choose only 1.
 
The d6 Rule: At really special moments, roll the d6. If it’s a 6, take an extra Value. If 1, take one less. Zero Values means you completely failed. Four means an extraordinary success.

## When the Fire Dies

```
The cataclysm is over and the world has ended. We alone survive, huddled around this last fire, waiting for it to die.

While the fire lingers, we remember the world that was and the deeds done in those last days. To some they bring warmth, to others, sorrow. Come, let us speak before the fire dies.

You will need: a candle, 10 matches, tokens, and a dark room. Define the cataclysm. Create archetypal characters: noble, warrior, priest, etc. Choose a first player. 

To begin, light the candle. The first player tells a brief story of the world before or during the cataclysm. When finished, the player takes a match, lights and extinguishes it, and hands it to another player who places the burnt match before them. It is now their turn to speak. Everyone must have a burnt match before them before taking a second turn.  

For each story, if a player is moved or inspired by another's story, they may give the storyteller a token.

When all matches have been burned, count the tokens, rolling a die for ties. The player with the most tokens concludes the story and blows out the candle.

And the fire dies.

## The Wake

```
Objective:
Honor the memory of the friend you lost.

Requirements:
• Three or more people
• Notecards
• An urn — a fireproof vessel
• Matches

Directions:
If the weather permits, go somewhere nice. If not, go elsewhere. Seek quiet. Stay close.

                           Sit in

                      a circle around

                          the urn.

Each person takes three cards and writes a number on the back of each:
                     1,
                             2,
                                     3.

Using no more than four words per card, each person answers the following:

On the first card,
       recount a treasured memory with a friend.

On the second card,
       describe a time you felt alone.

On the third card,
	     share your source of hope in the face of adversity.

Shuffle all cards into three stacks by number. Each person takes one card from each stack, making sure not to draw their own.

Each person studies their first card. When ready, they share that memory with the group as though it was their own before tearing the card up and dropping it into the urn.

Once each person has spoken, repeat for second and third cards.

                  When the time is right,

                      burn the cards

                     and seal the urn.

## Dispossessions

```
A team of ghost-hunters cleanse a possessed item to dispel evil from a home. 

Setup: 

This must be played at night. One player (Researcher) goes to a room with an internet-connected computer. The other players (Investigators) go to far-away room and turn-off all lights. They are only allowed a single source of light (flashlight or cell-phone). Players can only communicate across rooms by walkie-talkie or phone.

Play: 
The Investigators search for an item in the room that could be possessed. They describe it to the Researcher, who looks on the internet to find “its history.” This involves searching until they locate a spooky story about a comparable item (Ebay is useful). While waiting, the Investigators should describe bad vibes and minor supernatural occurrences happening.

If the Researcher cannot find something appropriate, they tell the Investigators that the chosen item is “clean” and they must choose another!

Once the Researcher locates and communicates a history, they click on a random Wikihow article and explain how to perform a cleansing ritual based on it. The Investigators conduct it and describe things escalating further (throwing themselves around, responding to unheard voices, etc.). 

End:
The Researcher runs to the room and observes the aftermath.

## The Great Work

```
Ours is a world of shadows. There are sparks of heavenly fire, but they are mired in mortal clay. We are diminished, robbed of our true potential. 

But in some there is a fire, not a spark. Bright enough to banish shadows. Bright enough, even, to turn lead into gold...

How to Play
You will need a Tarot deck, and 3-5 friends.

Each player creates an Alchemist.
-Choose their name and title.
-Choose a Major Arcana to represent them. 
-Choose their Great Work (maybe immortality, transcendence, life-creation). Match it to a Suit, then declare a Major Arcana that will mark its completion. 

To play, go around the table in rounds. Starting with the oldest player, go around the table drawing from the Tarot deck and describing your progress as below:
-Minor Arcana from your Suit: your work advances. Describe how you advance towards your goal.
-Minor Arcana from another Suit: you are sidetracked. Describe the useless wonder you create.
-Major Arcana:  your power grows. Describe how, and from now on draw two cards.
If you draw the Major Arcana you declared, you achieve your miracle. Describe the change it makes in the world of clay, then the game ends.

## Cats Herding Humans

```
In Cats Herding Humans, humans are playthings, companions, and caretakers. Mostly playthings.  Frustratingly, they are sometimes needed for opening things and vanquishing enemies.

Ma Wirth’s Boarding House and Cat Sanctuary is a hub of activity. Cats and humans are constantly taken in and adopted out (or whatever happens to humans). Sometimes, when humans leave, cats leave with them. Other cats stay and serve the House Cat Council.

Cats have six skills: Adorableness, Caterwauling, Mauling, Parkour, Sneaking, and Tracking (covers scent marking). Each skill uses a die. Starting skills use d20. As skills improve, they move through d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4 (best). When making an action, choose an appropriate skill and roll the corresponding die. The closer to the die’s middle numbers, the more successful the action. When making actions using multiple skills (Such as Adorableness and Caterwauling to beg), check for each skill individually when determining results. Remember, cats don’t fail so much as change their minds.

Starting cats select 5 skill improvements. Improve 1 skill after each successful game.

Possible plot hooks for the GM:
Drive off the obnoxious human
Refill the food
Find a fabled toy
Stop the invasion from beyond time
Breach the attic

## Mystery Mansion of the Mad Wizard

```
Villains have invaded the mansion! Defeat them, and grab some loot!
SET UP: 2-4 players, one deck of playing cards, a mini-figure per player, two dice.
Describe how your figure is a cool hero that is the best at: Fightpower (spades), Parkouring (clubs), Magickery (hearts), or Ninjability (diamonds). Your best allows a re-roll on like-suited challenges.
Shuffle the deck and place a 5x5 grid of face-down cards. Deal each player two cards. Cards on the grid are rooms; cards in hand are power-ups. Maximum hand size is 3. Figures start on opposite corner rooms. 
PLAY: On your turn you may move to an adjacent room orthogonally; flip your room face-up; or challenge a face-up room.
	Clubs: obstacles
	Diamonds: traps
	Hearts: puzzles
	Spades: enemies
	Faces:  villain! Defeat with a 12+
	Aces: +3 power-up!
Roll equal or above a room card rank to beat a challenge. Describe your… Victory? Keep the room card as a power-up. Replace rooms with a new face-down card. …Defeat? Discard a card and move to your start room. You can play power-ups before you roll. Any power-up adds +1. Like-suited adds +2. 
	
WINNING: Defeat three villains and move to your start room with the highest rank artifacts.

## Enna's friend or foe?

```
Enna is a bloodthirsty Elf ranger obsessed with beheading Orcs to collect their heads. She travels the kingdom seeking their lairs. Her 4 friends decide to join together to prevent her massacre.

The kingdom is drawn on a grid sheet. Enna and the other players start at opposite corners. All five players have four skills:  Deception, Trust, Love, Compassion. Players allocate their powers randomly to their 1d4 dice. They roll 1d6 to travel across the map (1-1 square, 2- 2 square movement, etc.). The friends’ goal is to converge where Enna is to convince her to stop. Enna’s goal is to have them joining her in her killing spree. 

When a friend encounters Enna, the friend rolls the 1d4 die to determine which skill to use, followed by a roll of 1d6 to get a score. Enna does the same. The friend wins a round if their score is higher than Enna’s. If not, Enna wins.

If Enna wins the round, the friend joins her against the other players. Enna wins the game when all have joined her party but Enna’s party wins automatically when they kill 10 orcs. The friends win when all have joined their party.

## Dust Trails

```
You and your pack roam the Wasteland on scrap-made vehicles, hunting other junk-pirates like you. 


Describe your badass vehicle and its role in the team
Choose its SPECS assigning 9 points between SPEED, WEAPONS and ARMOR. Min is 0, Max is 5.
Name your pilot.


Rules:

The GM narrates what is happening in the Wasteland: every time one of your SPECS is important to narration (i.e. maneuvering, shooting, avoiding damage), roll 1d6. 

If the result is equal or minor of your value, you succeed. If it’s higher, reduce the SPEC by one. 

If a SPEC ever goes below 0, you die in the Wasteland.  
Create a new character, it will join play as soon as the others hit TOWN.

You will find SCRAP by destroying enemy vehicles, the Gm will tell you how many KGs. 
Divide it equally among the team.

When you and your pack hit TOWN, you can use your SCRAP to upgrade you vehicle, 10kgs for 1 point of SPEED, WEAPONS or ARMOR.
 
If you reach 5 in all three SPECS, you have become a Wasteland Legend: give your character to the GM, it will become an important NPC in the story. Create a new character.

## Great Wallopers

```
The prairie dogs are attacking in force, how many points can you rack up before getting overrun! This game has two win conditions; Be the last one standing, or first to 10 points. Every round the prairie dogs attack in a force the size of the round, 1 at round one and 20 on round 20. Every round the players roll 1d20, as long as the players roll is greater than or equal to the prairie dogs they gain a point, otherwise they lose half of their points rounded up, hit 0 points and you lose. Players can exchange points to gain a permanent additional die of that size, 4 points for 1d4, you can reduce to 0 points this way without losing. If you roll a 20 on the d20 you gain an additional point.

## PROTAGONIST

```
Find 2 friends to play with. 
Pick a role each. 
The PROTAGONIST says who they are and what their goal is. 
Play to find out what happens. 

The game is narrated out of the perspective of the PROTAGONIST. They describe themselves, the scene and what is in it, but each description must be followed by a question, answered by the BEAST or GUARDIAN. 
    If both have an answer - failure fulfills the BEAST’s answer and success fulfills the GUARDIAN’s. 

When the PROTAGONIST has 0 remaining dice, switch roles to one you’ve not yet played this session. The game ends when the last PROTAGONIST has 0 dice or reached The GOAL.

GUARDIAN or BEAST cannot both use their powers on the same roll.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PROTAGONIST
Pick up 3d6, each representing traits or items.
Name/Describe these.
Discard after using. 
Roll to overcome adversity. 1-3 = failure. 4-6 = success!
Each new player does this, establishing new facts about the same PROTAGONIST.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GUARDIAN - a force for good
Add 1d4 to the PROTAGONIST’s roll (Once / Scene)
Introduce advantage (add 1d6 to PROTAGONIST’s pool) (Once / Scene)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The BEAST - a force for evil
Deduct 1d4 from PROTAGONIST’s roll (Once / Scene)
Force PROTAGONIST to roll against adversity

## Home Sweet Home

```
Welcome to the post apocalypse. You are six years old, like everyone you have ever known.

Begin by writing your name and answering questions. Each players asks another one question about their character/views. Questions like:

How many heads does your favourite animal have?
What do you think those metal things with four wheels are?
Where did you get that beeping metal bracelet?
Why are you see-through?

Each player than writes three goals:
-one personal
-one involving another character
-one about the world

Assign 1d4, 1d6, and 1d8 among them. Use the associated die when your goal is your motivation. You may also do the same to loan a die to help on a friend's roll. Roll above the difficulty to succeed.

Begin the game by revealing cards from a deck equal to the number of players. Arrange these in a grid. The group starts at the centre and begins exploration, taking turns to describe the scene associated with a card.

Clubs - Structure
Spades - Insentient
Diamonds - Phenomena
Hearts - Sentient

Number on the card = Difficulty of the task
Odd - something familiar 
Even - something strange 

Keep adding new cards as you explore further. The game ends once both jokers are revealed.
```
<hr> 

## Eight Facets of the City

```
Play this game on a shuffled deck of playing cards including jokers (54 cards total), using a pen.

For eight rounds, separate out a pile of seven cards (face down). The symbols for each round are circle, triangle, X, square, spiral, star, ?, and |||.  

1) Deal (from the pile) one card portrait-style write a name and/or title on the top edge and a further detail on the bottom edge.

2) Deal one card landscape and one card portrait (to the right, in a line). On the second portrait card, if it is unnamed, write a name and/or title and a detail.

3) Then on the landscape card write a place found in the city on the top and a further detail on the bottom. This should relate to the people in the two portrait cards.

4) Collect the left portrait card and put it on the bottom of the pile, then do the same with the landscape.

5) Repeat from (2), until you get a named landscape.

6) Then draw the symbol prominently on each of the seven cards.

Advice: Use associations, but don't force them. Try to let yourself discover what each symbol represents in your city.

## Exceptional Bodies for Exceptional Hosts

Brilliant night sky; stars twinkling; systems bustling; cultures clashing; peoples expanding, exploring.

A thousand thousand worlds; a thousand jungles; a thousand seas. Life everywhere.
Ah, the inspiration!

Where are we? The largest menagerie in the galaxy, of course! So many creatures! From so far, so wide!
Ah, the inspiration!

Why are we here? For the sampling. For new ideas. 
To get the creative juices flowing!
Ah, the inspiration!

What creature did you find? Where is it from? 
How is it beautiful? What can it do? How is it dangerous!? 
Oh!

Find another creature. Hmm, one more for good measure. How are they amazing? 
Now splice!

Don’t you just love Skellik’s work, black bioengineer extraordinaire that he is?
Describe for us his creation. Your creation. 

Your
new 
flesh.

Where will you wear it? What will you do there? 
For work? For pleasure? Maybe both?
What kind of dastardly deeds might you be up to today?
Hmm, yes!

What quirks have you discovered? What eccentricities have you enjoyed? Tastes, smells; impulses, instincts. 
Have they caused you trouble, or just more fun?
Mmm...!

Ah! The pleasure! The senses, excited! 

But how quickly they dull... Once again, evermore.
What to do...but start anew!

## NO TIME: A GAME ABOUT FAILURE

```
Destroy the evidence before the police arrive, disarm the bomb before it explodes, refuel the plane before the zombies overwhelm you.

Each character has a name, an aptitude, and a Job to do. Each Job consists of 20 points of tasks, assigned by the GM. The points in a task represent how difficult it is (Easy: 5, Taxing: 10, Hard: 15). Players have 4 d6s, each representing one action, to be distributed between tasks as the player chooses. To complete a task, players must match or exceed the difficulty of the task on their roll. The GM defines the Job.
Modifiers: +1 to a 1d6 if the aptitude is applicable to the task. +1 to a 1d6 if a PC dies during one action.
Example aptitudes: First Aid, Demolitions, Interrogation.


Failed outcomes of a task are narrated by the player, successful outcomes are narrated by the GM. Task difficulty and task importance are not related. Easy tasks might be crucial, hard tasks might be pointless. The players must determine this for themselves. Teamwork might be crucial or pointless. This game is not intended to be easy or fair.

The GM and the players narrate the outcome of the job together.

## Measured in Cups

```
Players: 2
Equipment: Gongfu tea brewing equipment.  Instructions are available here:  https://white2tea.com/2014/05/27/how-to-brew-puer-tea-three-basic-household-items/

In this game you play two people moving through the entirety of a friendship (NOT romance). The feel is modern slice of life.  

Prepare the tea for steeping.  As you do this, decide:

Where do you first meet?
What draws you to the other person?
What are your mutual interests?

Begin :

Steep the tea.  The player who pours the tea starts the conversation, set during your character's first meeting.

You can only speak after taking a sip.  When speaking, you can say one sentence of dialogue and one of description.  Take turns sipping and speaking.

When the tea leaves open fully, end this scene.

Middle:

Pause drinking.  Decide what you are doing together, around your shared interest, that you both have wanted to do for a long time.

This scene is the apex of your friendship.  Continue play as before.  End when the tea starts to taste hollow.

End:

Pause drinking.  Decide together what caused your friendship to fade.

This is one of the last times you will see each other.  Continue play as before.  End when the tea has completely faded.

## Fill in the Blank RPG

```
Players begin with 5 each of the following cards: Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs.

To attempt something the player rolls 1d10, success on 7+. To roll more dice, the player plays up to one of each kind of card. If the card is blank, write one word on the card. Words cannot be repeated. Players describe their action in one sentence using those words. The description must make sense to count; you can’t “sneak loudly”. This is at the GM’s discretion.

Facing an orc? Write “HUG” on a verb card and state “I HUG the orc,” to roll +1d10. Write “aggressively” on an adverb card and state “I AGGRESSIVELY HUG the orc,” to roll +2d10. Words can’t be erased, but cards can be used again. A player without blank cards cannot create new cards.

If a player gets hurt, they must destroy one of their cards.

The GM must create cards to roll more than 1d10. The GM must create one of each type of card before repeating any type. After the roll they put the cards in a pile. Players can destroy one of their written cards to take the top card or a random card from the pile.

## End of Days // Hidden Terrors

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The world has ended. Your job? Survive and conquer.

Each player needs: one deck of cards, three tokens.

Cards represent actions: 
Spades – Mental
Hearts – Social
Clubs – Physical
Diamonds - Player's choice. Magic? Weapons? Cash?

Conflicts are CAPITALISED: Play a card, describe an action, your opponent reciprocates. Highest card wins CONFLICT. Aces High, Jokers Wild. Suits don't have to match, but actions must make sense.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Youngest player = Survivor. 
Player to their left = Narrator.
Remaining players = Terrors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Draw 6 cards. Play one face-down.

Survivor introduces their Character and objective. Narrator introduces scene.

Narrators HINDERS Survivor five times. Narrate each Hindrance/Outcome. 

Won the most Conflicts? Take one token from the other player.

Terrors only ATTACK when Survivors play card with same suit as Terror’s face-down card. Describe your Terror, then ATTACK. Won the Conflict? Take two tokens from the other player.

Rounds end when all Survivor's cards are used, or after Terror’s ATTACK. Roles rotate clockwise. Discard hand, redraw 6, play one face-down. 

No tokens? You cannot be a Survivor until you win some back. Narrate your deaths/escapes. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got the most tokens after 7 Rounds? You win! Conclude all stories. 

Who Survived? Died? Remained Terrors?

It’s in your hands…

## Sharing Our Past

```
Gather a few friends, each person will need something to write with and something to write on. 

Everyone will take two minutes to develop a character in their head. Write parts of their backstory on the paper if needed. Ask yourself questions about them, like where they came from, what their life was like, and what they believed in. 

Once the two minutes is up, choose someone to start. When it is your turn, talk to the group about your character, going into their backstory, culture, religion, feats, or anything else you wish to share. During this time, choose three traits of your character, two positive and one negative, that came from their experiences. Then elaborate about each trait, explaining how it connects to your character’s past. After your turn, record your character’s traits on your piece of paper.

When everyone has gone, start again, and pick someone else’s trait that you’d like to hear more about, and ask a question about it. After they respond, add that trait to your character’s list. Repeat this step if the group wishes.

When the final round ends, release your characters back into their lands, now armed with knowledge of another’s life.

## Maslovmania

```
Maslovmania recommends 3+ players and a gm
gm decides setting (space, fantasy, etc)
Each player has a pyramid of needs. When a player has fulfilled all their needs, they win and the game ends. If a need is unfulfilled, all needs above it are instantly unfulfilled and cannot be fulfilled until that row of needs is complete.

Top
[Self-Actualisation]
[Prestige]	
[Intimacy]	[Accomplishment]
[Security]	[Health]	[Friends]	
[Food]		[Water]		[Warmth]	[Rest]
Bottom

Players takes turns, going clockwise. Each turn the player makes two actions from the following:
1. Choose someone to get a need of their choice, get two needs of your choice at the start of your next turn
2. Take away someone's need of your choice, get two needs of their choice taken from you at the start of your next turn
3. Exchange needs with another player
4. Take away an action of someone else on there next turn

Actions are made in secret and shared with the gm. At the end of a turn, the players play out a scene that explains how any needs affected were changed. If the gm feels their explanation is insufficient, the change is negated.

## Murder is Simple

```
A game about gumshoes, trying to solve a case in a city where everyone lies.

The GM prepares a mystery, writes its solution down and places a deck of cards on top of it. When all the cards are dealt, the truth comes to light.

The Players introduce themselves. They have three stats,  each of them starting at 0: Pain, Vice and Heat.

The GM sets a scene, then deals two card to the player leading the scene. Their sum is the target number the player has to roll over with a d20 +3 for each other participating player. If they fail, the GM can shuffle one of the dealt cards back in the deck. Then a new scene starts.

Every move below must be matched narratively.

The player may damage their stats to gain +1d6 to their roll per damage. 

They may also escalate a scene: they take 1 damage and they are dealt an additional card.

Face cards are Respites. They are instantly discarded and the player can heal 1 damage.

The stats cap at 4 damage. When all the player’s stats are capped, they bust and drop off the case. If all players bust, the story ends.

## Rise - Hack - Fall

```
One player is The Corporation, the rest are Hackers.  Do not let The Corporation see your stats.
Hackers secretly choose a Hack stat (1-10) and a Username.
Divide 30 Resources between all Hackers.
All discussion happens together. The Corporation listens and remembers.

Every mission, The Corporation has valuable data (choose 1-5). The Hackers decide which Hackers to send.  Roll 1d10 per point of value the data has.  These rolled values are the types of ICE protecting this server.  The Corporation explains their functions and digital appearance.
To melt ICE, Hackers may temporarily modify their Hack stat by secretly spending 1 Resource per point of change,  stating this new value, and removing 1 ICE matching that number.  Describe the process and destruction.  
If all ICE is melted, the Hackers divide Resources worth the data's value x3.  If ICE remains and no Hacker will melt it, the mission fails;  The Hackers get nothing.

After a mission, The Corporation may trace one Hacker by guessing their unmodified Hack stat.  If they succeed, they back-trace the Hacker to their rig and 'retire' them.  Explain your methods.  If they fail, the Hacker gains 3 Resources from their newfound net-cred for evading The Corporation.

## Heart Light

```
A melancholy game for 2 players.

The Kid befriends a strange being: an alien, a faerie, a ghost. The Adult has been on the hunt for just such a being.

One player is the Kid, the other, the Adult. Starting with the Kid, alternate answering the questions. Ask each other to elaborate.

KID | ADULT
How are you different from other kids your age? | When you were that age, what did you long for?
How did you and your Friend find each other? | What caused you to miss the Friend’s arrival?
How was life hard before your Friend arrived? | What’s missing from your life now?
How did you become Friends? | What doesn’t the Kid know that means the Friendship won’t last?
What does your Friend truly want? | What obstacles do you place in the way?

CRISIS
In short sentences, alternate describing the Crisis that draws the Kid, the Friend, and the Adult together, but endangers all 3.

KID | ADULT
How do you and the Adult bond over the Friend? | How do you and the Kid bond over the Friend?
How does it leave? | What do you regret about its departure?
What does it leave behind? | What does it leave behind?

## Cross the Floor

```
Two players.  

Long ago, you were close beyond ordinary love or friendship.  Then you betrayed one another.  

Decide together:  
- Where were you then?
- What did you share?
- What did each person do wrong?

Decide alone in secret:
- Why was this of all actions a great betrayal?
- What different life do you have now?

You have not seen one another since, until this moment.  It doesn’t matter where you are or what brought you here.

Decide together:
- How long has it been?
- What is different about the world these days?

Decide alone in secret:
- Why do you have nothing to lose?


Stand at the opposite ends of a large room.  

Make eye contact.  

It begins.

Walk slowly toward one another at the correct pace.

When you meet, at the right moment, raise your hand before you in a fist.

Make eye contact, take one breath together.  Release it.

Then open your hands.  Palm up means you choose to forgive them.  Palm down means you choose to kill them.

Look upon the result.

In a few gestures, act out what happens.  

Then hold your final positions until it is time to let go.

## Cast-a-Quadrans

```
Materials:
A pencil, a 3”x5” notecard, two coins, some poor fool to be your Game Moderator, already knowing what a “RPG” is.

Characters:
Write out a description on the notecard. Make it cool but not stupid. If the the GM doesn't like or can’t read it, erase everything, start over.

Adventures:
Read good books, watch cool movies, riff away on your own version.

Actions:
When something is in doubt, toss a coin, heads you succeed, tails you fail. If things are in your favor, flip two coins and succeed if either lands heads. If you’re disadvantaged, flip two coins and fail if either lands tails. GM and player hash out what failing, succeeding, advantaged and disadvantaged actually means. What’s written on your card matters.

Damage:
If you get walloped, flip your card over; you can’t use any of the stuff written on it until you’re fixed. If another really bad thing happens before you’re fixed, game over.

Advancement:
Mark your card’s corner when the GM agrees you’ve achieved something especially awesome. After you’ve marked all four corners, get a fresh card, rewrite your character, but a little more amazing now.

## (Dis)Agreement

```
A roleplaying exercise for two players

Prep: Choose a genre and list a few types of characters you would expect in such a story. Pick one each to play and come up with a personal disagreement between these two characters.

Ready: Mark off the center and ends of a straight line at least twelve feet long.
Set: Choose opposite ends and stand equidistant between your end of the line & the center with your back to the center.

Go: In character, voice your opinion on the disagreement. Whenever your character wants to listen to the other, turn towards them. Whenever your character wishes they didn’t have to listen, turn away. Whenever you feel closer to agreement, step towards the center. If you feel farther from agreement, step away from the center.

Finish line: Normal play ends when either player reaches their end or the center. Neither player can thenceforth speak, but the other player may immediately walk to the center or their end.

## The faithful few

```
Game is for three to eight players.

Players all work for a temple and the deity has decided that they should die, though one might be spared. Players can play solo or try to make allies with others.

The objective is to kill your opponents and stay alive. All can die (no winners), only one can remain alive.

It uses one or two typical poker cards deck with no jacks. Each player chooses a suit, mixes them and places the pile back up in front of him. 1d6 for player is used for damage.

On a piece of paper each player should write:
Character’s name, description, brief back story. The description should include what position the held at the temple and backstory how they got there, how long ago and what they used to do before.

Each round the players draw the top card. Highest begins it and so on. Even card means can attack. Odd can defend. They are not obligated to do that but must narrate if they prepare for a future attack.

Health pool is 25. Damage is calculated by the difference between the attacker and defender dice. Negative is damage to attacker.
