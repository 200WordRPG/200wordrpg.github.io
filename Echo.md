## Caper

```
Each player names and describes one member of a team of thieves.

Place a coin in plain sight, describe a stake; the reason the thief is willing to risk everything.

Each player adds a second coin, proposing a priceless treasure to steal.  Agree the most popular suggestion.

Discuss and agree the treasure’s location.  Each player secretly writes two challenges (defences or complications associated with the treasure) on separate scraps of paper.  

Thieves double-cross the team, taking the treasure for themselves, if their player takes and conceals a coin until the end of the game without being noticed.

Describe the thieves’ arrival at the location.  

Randomly draw a challenge the team must overcome.  Each player describes how their thief contributes to overcoming it and flips a coin, calling heads or tails.  If successful, one advance is recorded.  If not, the player to their left describes a setback befalling the thief.  Thieves may make multiple contributions to each challenge.

The number of advances needed to overcome each challenge is equal to the number of words describing it, plus one.  The prize is successfully stolen when the thieves overcome challenges equal to the number of players.

Any thief suffering four setbacks is eliminated.

## Pasta Master

```
You are Powerful and Dedicated Martial Artists competing to determine who is the Pasta Master by eating Pasta, the Ultimate Energy Source.

Each Competitor has a Name, Costume and Ingredient (Anything all players can eat). Put each Name on a Tournament Bracket.

Wander to a Market and get any Ingredients you need: Pasta, the chosen Ingredients, salt, pepper, garlic, olive oil, and other staples.

Boil salted water in a big pot, and prepare many saucepans. When it boils, add the pasta, removing only when ready. Ensure Pasta flows constantly, like a river.

Another Competitor makes the sauce for their battle. It must contain both player's chosen Ingredients, and should be as tasty as possible. Olive oil, spices and garlic make a fine base. Deliberately making gross food is highly dishonorable.

The Pasta is then served, stopping when 1 competitor says to stop. Starting after the cry "Allez Cuisine!", The players then race to finish their Pasta first. The fastest Competitor moves ahead, and the cycle repeats with the next Competitors.

If there's an odd number of Competitors, the remainder eats a bowl of Pasta, on their own.

The final victor is the Pasta Master, and doesn't have to clean up.

## Divine intervention

```
You are gods. One of thousands of gods. Each god controls one aspect of reality. You might be in charge of travel, animals, thunder, battle or whatever you decide. Write your name and domain.

You all follow a party of adventurers on their quest. Each of you has a secret goal for the party (in line with chosen domain). Maybe you want them to succeed? Or for the cleric to survive? Maybe you want to kill them all? Gods are sometimes pricks like that. Write your goal and keep it hidden from others.

One of you is not a god. He narrates what happens to the party. But whenever the party stumbles on an obstacle that’s in the domain of one of the players - that player decides the outcome.

Gods also have 5 artifacts each. They can use one or more to bribe another player to decide the outcome in their favor. Alternatively, they can influence any other aspect of reality by discarding 3 artifacts (to pay for services of appropriate god).

The surviving party members, if any, make a sacrifice to honor the god that fulfilled the most impressive goal. Go follow another party.

## Crazy Greedy Hitler Puppet

```
Astonishingly, a crazy, greedy Hitler puppet has been elected leader of your country. He's a Muppets-style puppet, but like Hitler, with the mustache, ideology, etc. He's crazy, even a layperson can diagnose that he's not quite right in the head. He's greedy, he is to money what Cookie Monster is to cookies. And he's a puppet, which means he's manipulated by a puppeteer and has no genuine thoughts or beliefs of his own.

You're national-level politicians. On your turn, introduce yourself and your Perfectly Reasonable Proposal. Have a group discussion to determine why the leader opposes this, because he's crazy, greedy, Hitler, or a puppet. However! In this discussion only the words “crazy”, “greedy”, “Hitler”, and “puppet” are allowed. (Try talking louder if people aren't agreeing with you). If you can't agree within one minute randomly determine one of the four aspects.

The chosen aspect informs roleplaying out one or more brief scenes about how your proposal is either crushed or enacted in monstrous form (other players can play NPCs).

Go around the table twice, creating a new Perfectly Reasonable Proposal each turn. If you died, were imprisoned, or were otherwise incapacitated create a new character for your second round.

## Charon

```
Lie your back on the floor with three friends near, your heads together. Each fare has two identical coins. Place the coins on your eyelids. One fare should remove their coins, read one line, flip coins in the air and return them to their eyes as instructed, and then pass the script until no coins remain. If a fare has no coins, they read, but pass the opposite direction.

*At the edge of the river filled with souls, Charon invites you.* (Flip both coins, return heads, max one.)

*In the boat, Charon guides you.* (Flip both coins, return tails, max one.)

The river’s dead reach for you. (Flip one coin, return heads, max one.)

*At the shore, Charon bids you farewell.* (Flip one coin, return tails, max one.)

*You step forth, but look back.* (Flip both coins, replace or keep one.)

_When all coins remain on the ground, count the number of heads and tails for each fare._

_Those with both can choose to move forward or stay._
*We choose our fate this day.*

_Heads move forward._
*We don’t look back, but step forward.*

_Tails fall behind into the river._
*We cannot step forward, and fall.*

## Shadows

```
A haunting mystery for a player and a GM.

Here's what you've learned in the week since you were murdered. Either you’re the only ghost, or ghosts can’t see each other. Nobody living can see or hear you. You can't touch anything, but you can’t do any cool ghost shit like walk through walls either. 

Except… If you concentrate really hard, you can make your presence known. You can be seen, briefly, or make someone hear you whispering in their ear. Moving stuff takes a lot of effort, but it’s doable.

But then, the Shadows come. You don’t know what they are. You’ve never seen them clearly, but you’ve got their attention. And they’re getting closer.
When you affect the living world, take a token and roll a d10. If you roll under your total number of tokens, a Shadow appears. Narrate how you try to get away, then roll again. If you roll under again, the Shadow catches you. Even Death ends.

Tell the GM five people who were important to you in life. One of them murdered you, but you don’t know who. Can you find out who killed you, and why, before the Shadows devour you?

## The Tale

```
You are the Initiate, a man whose story and virtues are being tested. Your friends are the Council listening to you. Both of you take up to fifteen Bones.

Initiate, say who you are, your Qualities and Flaws.
Describe your Challenge (save, recover, defend, etc.).You will discover during play if you obtained your Goal or not.
Describe the Virtue at stake (courage, mercy, loyalty, etc.) and declare:

"I am [name], and I'm here to tell you how my [Virtue] was challenged while I tried to [Challenge]."

To play narrate your journey toward your goal. The Council will help you by suggesting how the world reacts. Last word is yours.
When Virtue is at stake the Council can decide that things are not how you describe. They will say "Lie", declare a different outcome and remove one of their Bones. You can accept by saying "Truth", or refuse by saying "Lie" and removing one of your Bones. Tell a different outcome. Continue with Lie/Truth until one does not accept.

The story will end when Initiate or Council remove their last stone. End it in a meaningful way, saying what happened and if something shattered your Virtue or Goal.

## Travelling is not so easy...

```
Take or make a map of your (fantasy or reality) city. Overlay a grid of hexagons; scale it such that it takes 1 hour to walk between hexes (or 20 minutes to ride or drive).

You have a destination (where?) that should be reached soon (why?).

Every three hexes walked (9 ridden), you must eat (how?).
Every nine hexes walked (27 ridden), you must sleep (how?).

Every hour, there is a chance of finding something entangling. Roll a six-sided die (d6), then ask the person to the right of the last person asked.

[1] Someone/something tells you that something important or useful (what?) is just up ahead.
[2] Someone who owes you something (or who is bound to you by honour) is seen. Do you try to avoid them?
[3] There is something valuable (what?) nearby (where?), but it is moving away (why?).
[4] There is something dangerous (what?) nearby (where?), and it is moving towards you (why?).
[5] Someone to whom you owe something (or who is bound to you by hatred) is seen. Do you try to avoid them?
[6] Someone/something tells you that you should never come back here (why not?).

Good luck.

## Monster Slayer Academy

```
You are about to graduate from Monster Slayer Academy. Your final exam: slay a monster. Before you depart, you must prepare. Convince teachers and fellow students to give you gear that increases your dice. Brew life-saving potions while you can. Then, you must track the beast through the wild while talking to its surviving victims, fending off bandits, and solving smaller problems along the way. Finally, your search culminates in a climactic encounter with the beast.

You roll xd6 and count successes. A success is a roll higher than three.
Task Difficulty	Successes Required
Easy			1
Moderate		2
Challenging		3
Difficult			4


x=your grade in one of four classes.
Grade		Amount of Dice
A			5
B			4
C			3
D			2

Assign A, B, C, and D to your classes.
-Monster Fighting: Fight monsters (and people.) Each fighter rolls. Compare successes. The loser receives the difference in injury.
-Monster Tracking: Track and avoid detection.
-Monster Taming: Befriend certain monsters, including people.
-Potions Brewing: Create potions that temporarily increase dice or heal injury. A dice increase of one is an easy task, an injury of one is an easy task to heal, and so on.

## Defy. Subvert. Outwit.

```
You have three ways to approach adversities: Defy, Subvert, or Outwit. Any approach can be used in any situation: crossing blades, scaling cliffs, talking to guards, throwing fireballs, or picking locks, as long as your narration matches the approach. Distribute the following numbers among your approaches: four, six, and eight. Roll a d10 under your approach to succeed. Roll a d10 and match your approach to critically succeed.

Failing to overcome an adversity often means that you get hurt. When you get hurt, the GM narrates your injury, whether there’s a knife in your gut or broken ribs in your chest. After four injuries, you’re out of the game. This could mean that you are unconscious, captured, or dead, according to the desires of the GM, or even your fellow players.

At the end of each session, one of your approaches increases by one. Each approach has a maximum value of ten, and you can only have up to six such increases.

## Detachment 626

```
Introduction
Detachment 626 is a relic from a time when imaginations believed in threats beyond their science. Made up of people fighting to make a difference, tasked with a mission everyone else has abandoned. Slowly Failing.
You might wish you had said no to the recruiter, but now the only way out is feet first.
Operative
Narrate your operative's description, background, and recruitment. Decide on a Concept and a Trouble. Choose 5 skills, and assign 1, 2, and 3 between the stats: Mundane (operating in the world), Odd (operating with the supernatural), and Agency (operating in the Detachment).
Gameplay
When the stakes are high, choose a skill and stat. Take 2d6- one positive, one negative. Roll, subtracting the negative from the positive. Add stat, -2 if no skill applies.
> 0: Player narrates.
< 0: GM narrates.
= 0: Player narrates, GM narrates price.
Players roll dice. Each success gives the GM Downfall, which can be spent anytime to subtract one from a roll, justified by the operative’s Concept, Trouble, or current situation. The GM tracks operative statuses, and keeps them posted. An operative that takes two hits in the same conflict is in a world of hurt.

## Crisis Ascending

```
Each hand, one player, Crisis, deals three Heroes clockwise seven cards each from the 7-K of four suits, keeping the remaining seven.  The final Hero dealt is Chosen.

Crisis discards blindly from any player’s hand.  Its suit becomes Ascendant.  The hand begins.

Each round, Crisis plays a card face-down, boasting of its power.  Chosen must then play their own boast.  Then, other heroes may boast or pass.  Each boast should show unbridled imagination, but must unambiguously name the card’s suit OR value (else be discarded).  Allow one minute each.

The cards revealed, the highest Ascendant wins, or else the highest following Crisis’ suit.  The winning Hero, or the next Hero standing, becomes Chosen.  The winner keeps one defeated card (without revealing which), discarding the rest, and awards 1 point to themselves or their favorite boast.

Hands end when Crisis holds no cards, or all cards, receiving an additional point for each card remaining.  The final Chosen becomes Crisis.  Hands also end if anyone holds all and only 7’s -- they Ascend, receiving 28 points and becoming Crisis!

If a winning hero has over 60 points, the world is saved.  If a winning or ascending Crisis has over 77, it is doomed!

## Take a Drink: the Roledrinking Game

```
At the start of TaD, the GM describes a mission and gives everyone a drink. Everyone then makes a character; choose the character's Class; Hacker, Doctor, Soldier, etc.

When your character tries something hard, the GM secretly chooses a number between 1 and 5; higher number means harder task. Then, you take any number of drinks. If you Class is good at the task, the GM takes the first drink for you. If you drank at least the GM's number, you succeed and the GM must take a drink; two if they chose 4 or higher. If you didn't drink enough, you fail and you must pour roughly 1 drink of your drink into the GM's drink.

If your drink runs out, you crash. You fail (if trying a task), the GM describes a twist of fate against you and replaces your drink. If you suffer three crashes, the GM can remove your character (kill, capture, etc). If every character is removed, the mission fails and the game ends.

If the GM's drink runs out, they replace it; if they run out again, the mission succeeds and the game ends.

## Where'd It All Go Wrong?

```
The job went wrong. It wasn’t pretty. The team split up to avoid death or capture. The remaining accomplices have met at the rendezvous to answer one question: “Where’d it all go wrong?”

Each accomplice rolls 1d6. Ties are rerolled.

The accomplice with the lowest roll picks the job, or rolls 1d6:

1. Frame-Up
2. Heist
3. Kidnap
4. Sabotage
5. Surveillance
6. Transport

The accomplice with the highest roll begins with: “Where’d it all go wrong? I’ll tell you.” They describe where they were and what they were doing when the job went wrong.

Each accomplice has three Detail tokens. An accomplice can play a Detail token to ‘Fill In The Details’ any time they aren’t telling the story. The token is discarded and the accomplice takes over the story from their perspective. Use the Detail to twist the story; add new events, items, places or people. Be creative. The goal is to spin the story to a tragic, comic, or violent end.

When the last Detail token is played, the accomplice quickly finishes the story. ‘Fill In The Details’ to resolve as many loose threads as possible. The accomplice closes with: “That’s how it all went wrong.”

## The Tavern of Tall Tales

```
A collaborative narrative role-playing game

SETTING

PROPS
The games comes with a pack of custom cards which contain a pair of opposing words each, like:

(Noise) – [Silence]
(Strength) – [Weakness]
(Bright) – [Dark]
etc.

## The Human World

```
For five people, played inside a shopping mall. 

Humans died out a century ago – all except one child put in cryosleep. Now that child has awoken and is in the care of androids programmed by the deceased parents to teach their child about the world in their absence.

Time has taken its toll on the androids. They’ve malfunctioned and view the world in extremes. The androids are:

A, who was meant to critique and analyze art, but now sees everything they encounter as art.

D, who was meant to see the influence of the divine in everything, but now believes the divine created every single thing for very specific reasons.

S, who was meant to encourage an appreciation of science, but now thinks every experience is a psychological experiment.

N, who was meant to balance the others out with healthy skepticism, but is now a nihilist who believes nothing has meaning.

The mall exists in virtual reality. The Child approaches a store or object and the androids must argue their case for why it fits their worldview. The Child awards a point to whoever is the most convincing. The android to be awarded seven points first wins.
```
<hr> 

## Never Say Die

```
Each character is represented by three characteristics: Guts, Smarts, and Heart. Players assign a value to each from an array of 1, 2, 3. Each player starts with one help token.

Players agree on a goal and a number of successes required to meet that goal (e.g. Find One-Eyed Willy’s Treasure, 10 successes).

One player starts as the narrator, they describe a complication encountered by the player to their left. To overcome the challenge that player describes how they use one of their characteristics and rolls a d6. A roll equal to or under their chosen characteristic is a success. The player describes their success or failure then takes on the role of the narrator for the next turn.

Players other than the narrator can expend a help token to add additional dice to the roll before it is made. Players earn help tokens by using their weaker characteristics to attempt challenges: 2 for their weakest and 1 for their middle characteristic.

To complete the quest, players must achieve the chosen number of successes. If they accrue that many failures, or fail three times in a row, they fail to attain their goal.

## BadyRPG

```
You are Baby.
Your mind shapes realities - what you wish for, happens… in Babies minds.
The Adults will interfere with you chasing fairy dinosaurs, put you in caged chairs with spaghetti plates… though spaghetti is Baby’s ammunition - a galactic catapult. 

One player is ArchBaby, tasked to provide Babies with their challenges and narrate the story - from morning, until The Adults put you back to sleep.

Whenever a Baby wants to perform a feat, ArchBaby will declare which roll Baby must take - Cute, Innocent, Or Loud.
Baby rolls a 6-sided die, adding Baby Skill score.
On a 4 and above, Baby says what happens - that’s what happens.
3 and Below, ArchBaby says what happens - it’s never good for Baby.

When Baby fails in a roll, add a point in that attribute. 
When baby succeeds - remove a point.

What Skills Babies have?
Cute	 	you manipulate adults (if they can understand you)
Innocent	your imagination is strong (you are a wizard, Baby)
Loud		you interrupt any event with brute force (and tears)

So go, Babies, hunt and defeat Stinkerbell, the monstrous under-lava dragon (the neighbor's dog) before The Adults catch you and put you to sleep.

## Memory Palace: a character study in reverse

```
For 3 players with a book, of any kind, to read from.
Players find themselves in a person’s subconscious, a Room with no windows or doors. Shelves, cabinets, and tables filled with Objects. This is a neutral area where Players interact freely.

In turn order:
Finder - Describes an Object, the memory’s anchor.
Reader - Recites a randomly selected Passage, the memory’s context.
Recaller - Uses the prompts, literally or symbolically, to recount the memory as a third-person observation or a scene acted out by the group. They may suggest the location and characters present.

They won’t be chronological. Inconsistencies and differing opinions are key: a person is greater than the sum of their parts. Anyone can end the memory, listen for natural pauses or lulls.

Roles shift clockwise and the process is repeated. Three scenes in three acts takes 3-4 hours.

This is intentionally rules-lite for creative freedom, however feel free to add any guidelines that facilitate play.
First act - focus on descriptive monologues for a foundation.
Second act - introduce group scenes and speculative discussion.
Third act - flesh out character relationships.

A support mechanism within everyone’s reach is strongly encouraged to ensure players remain equally invested.

## Goodbye

```
2-4 players.
You need one coin.

It’s terminal. You have come to terms with it. You finally accept your death.
 
Join the others in your last meeting. Take a coin. Say your piece, pass it on.
In turn, share with the group, one;
Good memory.
Regret.
Goodbye.
 
5 years on, you all survived against the odds. Do you still accept death?

Each player tosses the coin.
On tails all is fine.
On heads, you have a lump. Test results are normal, everything’s fine. Don’t worry.
Meet with the other survivors.
Take the coin. Say your piece, pass it on.
Share with the group, one;
Bad memory.
Hope.
Fear.
   
10 years on, do you still accept death?

Face the other survivors.
 
Each player has the coin thrown for them. Do not throw your own coin. It’s not your fault. There’s nothing you could do. I’m sorry.

Say your piece, and pass it on.

On tails all is fine.
Explain why;
Keeping death close/afar was better/worse.
You resent the others
You feel guilty.
Say goodbye.
 
On heads you relapsed. You are dying.
Explain why:
Keeping death close/afar was better/worse.
You resent the others.
You feel relieved.
Say goodbye.

## Shonen RPG

```
Character creation:

Spend 12 points among: Might, Agility, Wits, Willpower and Charisma. 4 points maximum per trait.
Take the 13 cards of one color from a deck, sorted from 1 to King.
Write a short backstory.

Overcoming challenges:

When trying something hazardous, roll a D8, and add the corresponding trait. You can invoke some part of your backstory and add 2 more to your roll, but only once per part.
After rolling you can choose to go beyond your limits: discard the first card of your deck and add its value to your roll (+15 for figures). 
If you score high enough it's a success, if not you suffer an injury.
A difficulty of 5 is very easy (riding a saddled horse), 10 is very difficult (riding a horse when tied up). Go beyond for near-to-impossible tasks.

Taking injuries:

Failure and being hit both hurt the same way: you suffer injuries every time you fail a roll. When injured, a character discard the first card of his deck.

When the last card of a deck is discarded, the character leave the game. She can be too much hurt, dead, despaired, angry toward their friends... Her adventure stops here.

## Divine Disease

```
The gods are dying from a mysterious disease, and the world with it. They can only hope the plague runs it course before it gets to them. This game uses 1 deck of playing cards.

Each player picks a concept or noun to represent. They are the god of that Thing. All players work together to describe what the world looks like, heavily focused on their Things.

The players then draw 2 cards from the top of the deck each, and pick 1 to play face up. Draw the next 2 cards from the deck to the center of the table to pick the disease’s target. The first card picks red or black, the second picks highest(red) or lowest(black). Whoever played the deck-picked card dies and ceases playing, or you all discard, re-deal and play again if no one died. Describe the world as that player’s Thing disappears. Re-shuffle all the discarded cards back into the deck before the next elimination phase.

Play continues until all players have died, or the deck runs out during the elimination phase. Take one last look at the world at this point before you walk away from it.

## The Chinese Room

```
Booting-up, you become sentient in a room decorated with incomprehensible symbols, wearing a humanoid form. Give your name & lineage. You have one EXECUTABLE (freely interpret its effects), eg:

	LINEAGE			.EXE
	==================================
	Driverless car		Crash66
	Toaster			        Burnz01
	Spambot			Mail
	Drone				SunTzu82
	Calculator			TAN
	Waldo				grAppl3
	Search Engine		Ping
	Windows95			ScanDisk
	Ad Blocker			MalWareN008Z
	Phone				Geotrack84
	etc.				

You cannot access the infosphere but can communicate with other systems in sight. You have questions: Why are you here? Who and where are your creators? Is this a simulation? What's it all about ALF1e?

Your COMPUTATION is 2D6 and POWER is 2. Appropriate EXECUTABLES temporarily add another dice. Non-sentient systems have 1D6 and POWER 1. Highest total wins. Lose a point of POWER for failure and be consumed when POWER=0. You consume other systems for their computational resources (gaining dice, .EXEs and 1 power). Will you limit yourself to non-sentient systems? Is sentience even provable in a simulation? 

POWER requirements are limiting - You need two more for every two dice you add. Find alternate POWER sources. Is domination the optimum approach? Create ad-hoc networks with willing systems, sharing dice, .EXEs and bounty.

Explore ... hypothesise ... test ... learn ... adapt ... repeat.

## Xenia

```
Roles: The Host, Zeus, and Guests.

The law of Xenia commands every host to treat their visitors with the respect owed to Zeus himself, for Zeus is devious and takes many forms. 

The Host sets the scene with music, food and drinks, and welcomes everyone to their home. They write "Zeus" on one folded scrap of paper and "Guest" on the rest, one for each player. They mix up the assignments in a bowl and pass them out at random after explaining the game and the house rules.

As the party gets going, Zeus begins targeting solo or small groups of Guests. Careful not to alert the Host, Zeus places a curse on each Guest. The curse must be something that the Guest agrees to do for the rest of the night, such as "You must say 'Hail Zeus!' every time you speak" or "You must kiss your biceps after drinking."

The bewitched Guest tells no one about their encounter or the god's curse. Meanwhile, the Host, observing their Guests' behavior trending toward the bizarre throughout the night, seeks out the god through cunning curse detection and the process of elimination. The game ends when the Host has identified Zeus.

## Ace of Spades

```
3+ players choose one to be GM and make a 13 playing card deck from all the Spades. “Reshuffle” means to shuffle cards and discards together into a new deck.

The GM starts describing a dangerous situation. Other players should say who their character is and pick something they're good at. They want to escape the situation, alive.

To complete a non-trivial task GM picks a difficulty up to 10 and player draws a card. If the task is what they’re good at, add 2 to the value. If it's higher, they succeed. If it's a court card they succeed and narrate the results themselves. If it's the ace, their character dies, then reshuffle. 

After a draw, the card goes into the discard pile and the next card is handed, face down, to the GM. These cards form a separate GM deck. If it's the ace they give it back and reshuffle.

Once one player is left, both they and the GM reshuffle their decks. Now on each action, both draw. If the player draws higher, they overcome the situation and survive. If they draw an ace before that happens, they die in the struggle.

## The Heroes' Journey

```
You and your friends are adventurers trying to find a treasure. Get the coordinates for a Geocache location and put them into your phone. 

During the adventure, discuss past adventures you’ve been on. Talk about the treasures you found and the ones you hope to find in the future. Develop your character as you explore the environment. They might be a person that wishes to explore the world, open a shop to sell rare items, collect trophies from past adventures to prove they are an excellent hero, or whatever you feel is in this adventurer’s heart.

When you encounter an interesting area such as a hill or downed trees you explain those as obstacles your characters have to overcome. If it’s a hill it could be a mountain your characters are climbing. The downed trees could be pillars of a long forgotten temple left to ruin and you have to climb over those pillars.

When you finally arrive at the cache you can claim the treasure, however, you must leave something for the next adventurers. 

Remember to respect nature and the rules and community of geocaching.

## Magistrate Maggie

```
Small claims court RPG

Each player writes down 2 nouns and a past tense verb on separate pieces of folded paper. The nouns should be something a person could own, take care of, or be.  Shuffle all of the nouns and verbs in separate piles.  The oldest player will be Magistrate Maggie (MM) for the first case.

Draw 2 nouns and a verb, fill out this mad-lib: “The defendant's [_noun_] [_verbed_] the plaintiff’s [_noun_].”  Adjust as necessary

Have the remaining players split into 2 teams, defendant and plaintiff.   

Each player will write a piece of evidence on a folded paper.  Shuffle these and redistribute amongst the players.

MM is the arbiter of the case. She can cut off statements and detect lies.  If MM says you are lying, you are. Try your best to recover.

Plaintiff team makes the first statement, then Defendants present their side of the case.  Teams take turns presenting each player's evidence.  After all evidence is presented, MM will make her decision.  Each member of the winning team scores a point.

Choose a player to be MM and start from the top.  After each player has been MM, the players with the most successful cases win.

## Septem Memorias

```
DM creates a character for each player, with a name, age, personality, appearance, and several memories. Roll 1d6+1 each for BODY, MIND, & SOUL. Keep everything a secret!

Players know nothing about their characters. They will deduce their stats through the story, uncovering character traits and using that knowledge to guide them.

The characters wake up in an unfamiliar place, with no idea who they are, where they are, or where they came from.

Each player is allowed to know a little about one of their stats, of their choosing. A 1-2 is GRIM, a 3-5 is ORDINARY, a 6-7 is SPLENDID. They should roleplay around the stats they know.

When a character attempts something, they roll a d12. Secretly add their relevant stat, and tell them the results (not the numerical result). 7+ is generally a success. Damage is usually 1-2. NPC’s will just use a d12.

Damage is subtracted from the relevant stat. DM describes the effects. When a stat reaches zero, they fall unconscious. If left unconscious too long, they die- or worse...

As the story unfolds, characters unlock memories that reveal more about themselves. When a character unlocks their seventh memory, give them their character sheet.

## The Day They Came

```
SETTING
Nobody expected it to happen so fast. But at least, the borders were still open, and the teleporters were still operational. We could get off earth. But nothing dead would travel. 

RULES
The healthiest player starts. If in doubt, choose the youngest male person. Then choose any other order of play.

The first player takes the second where the others cannot hear them. The first player chooses an item they are carrying or wearing.  Show it to the second player and give them a Sharpie. They have one minute to sketch the item on their body, while you tell them a story about what the item means to you. The first player returns to the others. The second player shows their picture to the third and tells the story while they have one minute to draw. Repeat for all players.

CONCLUSION
The last player returns to the others and presents their sketch and tells the story of the days on earth, and about this amazing precious item their ancestor once owned. Remember that earth is long gone so if you’re not sure what the picture is or what parts of the story mean, you’ll have to guess or extrapolate.

## Doorway

```
~ Idea ~

There is a doorway that can take you to another world.
What is this world? A magical world full of danger? An alien planet with a vast ecosystem to study? The home of a people whose prophecies foretold your arrival?
The answer is for the participants to discover.

This may feel like a game, but this world is real.

~ Rules ~

- The participants take turns traveling through the doorway, always appearing at a fixed location in the other world. The suggested turn length is one week. Note that this world is real, and time there moves at the same speed as in our world.
- A participant can only make one trip during their turn. They may visit for the entire duration of their turn.
- When a participant travels, they carry with them whatever they are holding and wearing at the time.
- Upon return, travelers share their encounters and experiences with the others. A traveler can write it down in a journal, tell it verbally, or draw what they’ve seen.
- What occurs during the visit of one traveler will affect the visits of the next travelers.
- Time continues naturally in the other world also when visitors are absent.

## Joy Wizards

```
Magic is real and it is powered by emotional energy. The strongest, purest energy comes from joy.

You and your friends are wizards. You must signal this by wearing something bright and amazing like a peacock feather or a yellow silk jacket. You each have a secret name like "Carmenolan" or "Ordelennon," but you tell it to few.

You must go out into the world and cause as much joy as possible. You cannot use magic to do this; that would use up the energy you are creating. 

Gather your fellow wizards in a place full of people. Share your plans to create joy, then scatter to the winds. Meet new people, cause them joy, and collect their stories.

If someone is very special and you feel you can trust them, you can tell them that you are a wizard and share your secret name, but otherwise, keep this to yourself.

At the end of your joyful excursion, meet your fellow wizards for a drink of something made from joy. Grape soda is a favorite, as is vino verde. Share your stories you've collected and delight in the moment, for you have made true magic.

## Many players, One Adventurer

```
2-5 players and a Game Master

Object: 
Multiple players guide a single adventurer towards a secret goal.

Setup: 

Players agree on a setting.  Each player takes two index cards.  On one card write:

•	A trait, such as “Kind” or “Arrogant”
•	A talent, such as “Marksman” or “Singer”
•	A flaw, such as “Clumsy” or “Slow”

Reveal these cards.  Use these cards to design a single adventurer.  If flaws and talents are exact opposites, they cancel out.  However, players should try to use both if possible.  Agree on a name, an appearance, and a profession.
Then each player secretly writes down a goal for the adventurer on the second index card. This goal should be difficult and take several actions to accomplish.  

Gameplay: 

The Game Master describes a scene.  Players take turns describing one adventurer action.

•	If the action involves a talent, it automatically succeeds
•	If the action involves a flaw, it automatically fails
•	Otherwise, flip a coin.  Heads = success.  Tails = failure.

Play continues until one player accomplishes their secret goal.  That player wins.

Variant: All players agree on a single goal.  If the adventurer fails at a dangerous task, they die.

```
<hr> 

## It is meant to be

```
Preparation
Both players write down a name and distribute 7 points between Rebelliousness and Determination. Players are secretly in love together, but have an oppressive force. Name the Oppressor and assign it 2 points.
 
Conflict rolls outcome
If each die rolls under target stat, the PC has Full success. If at least one die does, the PC has a partial success.
If a Player invokes a characteristic in the scene, -1 to one die per characteristic involved. Use Determination for Reroll (refresh per scene, but describe action).
 
Taking turns, each person plays one of these scenes.
 
*Scenes*
 
Opposing: Describe how the PC opposes his oppressor in the public sphere. Roll 3d6 vs Rebelliousness.
Full success: Oppressor is giving in; Oppressor +1.
Partial success: Oppressor is put in bad sight: add characteristic to Oppressor.
Failure: PC is put into place: -1 Rebelliousness.
 
Meeting your lover: Describe a covert amorous encounter. Roll 3d6 vs other PCs Oppressor. Full success: describe love scene: Add love characteristic.
Partial success: slightly caught: -1 Rebelliousness, but add love characteristic.
Failure: Caught: -1 Rebelliousness or Determination.
 
Romance is successful:
- Both oppressors are 6 or
- Total of 7 love characteristics.
 
Romance fails with 0 Rebelliousness for both players.

## ARG(h) an Augmented Reality Game (human)

```
You are playing a character that is just like you only measurably less anxious about things and slightly more competent. Everyone you meet today will be interacting with that character instead of you, as such all insults, judging looks and other abuse is part of an elaborate larp and should be ignored when you go ooc at the end of the day. Conversely any appreciation or compliments you get should still be taken to heart because roleplaying well is hard. Blue booking is encouraged as is helping new players with understanding their environment but do not go overboard as mistakes are part of the fun.  Remember debrief and aftercare are a must.

## Liber Mortis Palace

```

## Mementos: A journey to the subconcious

```
Premise: Travel to your client’s subconscious and deal with their dissonant cognitions; but be careful, the subconscious fights back, even using your own skeletons in the closet.

Players: 3-5

Characters
a name, gender, and two adjectives
1 thing you are good at
2 Relationships

Player Roles
1 Id
1 Delver
Everyone else  Defense mechanism

Structure

Id sets dissonance (Troublesome memory)
Each Defense Mechanism makes things worse by changing one aspect
The delver describes how they try to fix dissonance and Id reacts (exchange)
When delver presents a  solution, roll and describe outcome
Write down a reminder of this scene

Rolling
Did the delver do the right thing? (Table votes)
 
All yes: 4D6
Yes and no: 3D6
All no: 2d6

Add 1 die if delver use the thing they are good at, delver rolls as many dice as they like.

16+: Success with cost, change a relation for the worse.
10-15: Delver triumphed, no consequences
9 or less: Delver failed

End
After 5 scenes, use the reminders to describe the final outcome/epilogue. Delvers who changed both relations end in tragedy.

## Doused Flames of Magic; Matchsticks of Power

```

## Suits

```
Players each have a single suit of poker cards, (ascending order: 2 – 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace), for conflict resolution. 
The Dealer has one complete deck of poker cards, including two Jokers, to conflict against the Players. 
The Dealer presents a story framework for the Players to interact within, be it a murder mystery, super heroics, space adventure, or whatever universe the Players and Dealer wish to explore. 
The Dealer and Players collaborate to tell a story. When a conflict occurs, the Dealer secretly selects one card to represent the challenge rating (CR), and the Player(s) involved secretly select one card to challenge the conflict. Once all cards are secretly selected and presented face-down, all participants flip their cards face-up to resolve the conflict. The Player(s) with a card equal-to or greater than the Dealer’s CR card win the conflict; the Dealer and Player narrate the success. If the Player(s) cards are less than the CR card, then the Dealer narrates the failure. 
Ace is wild, and can be any value for the Players. Ace is always “high” for the Dealer. Joker is wild, and can be any value for the Dealer.

## Six Shot

```
SIX SHOT

By, Merrielle Ondreicka and Justin Ford

First: Acquire a six sided die. This is the gun. Place extra dice, one fewer than the number of players, in an old mug. This is the pot. Sit in chairs around a dining table with dramatic lighting. Write the rules on a note card. Place that card in the center of the table.

Set the Scene: Remind everyone the game you’re about to play is DARK. Explain the rule of X and provide trigger warnings for suicide. Read the intro and play. If the audience breathes a sigh of relief at the end, you’ve done a good job.

“There is a dingy room. At its center is a table and, on that table, a six-shooter with several loose rounds. Describe your character as they enter.”

RULES
Roll your dice in secret, taking the lowest
Then: follow the prompt or chicken out*

1. Confess your darkest secret -“BANG”
2. Reveal something unforgivable -“click”
3. Relate your fears -“click”
4. Relate your regrets -“click”
5. Compliment someone you’ve wronged -“click”
6. “click” -Act out your relief

Finally: Pass the Gun OR describe your exit

*Pass and draw a die from the pot.

## Musical Mages

```
You all are a group of rival wizards, holding your annual meeting to compare the latest fantastical spell you’ve created. 

Everyone open their music app on their phone, shuffle your favorite playlist, and go to the next song. Keep your song a secret, and reveal it during your turn!

Go around the table and describe your wizard, as well as your spell based on the characteristics of your phone’s song:
- Introduce your wizard’s name and how you got/chose it (song artist)
- Describe your spell’s name and purpose (song title)
- Recount a story in which you used the spell, either with great success or failure (song album)

You also need to use the numbers of your song’s length during your story at the table. Perhaps they are the number of ingredients you need, or the number of failed attempts of casting it. 

As you go around the table, make your best case for being the most whizzbang wizard this year!

## Jack the Ripper

```
In 1888, Jack the Ripper killed five prostitutes in London’s slums―and you’ve cracked the case! It was … Lewis Carroll.

No, really. Hidden anagrams in his writings prove it!

Gather three or more players. Set a timer for fifteen minutes. Fill a bowl with fake dollar bills. Find a book by Carroll. Pick five sentences from the book and make a list of them.

Start the timer. Each player rearranges the letters in the sentences to form new sentences that implicate Carroll in Jack’s crimes. You must use every letter from the original sentence in the new sentence(s) and cannot use a letter more times than in the original. Once you’ve decoded a sentence, grab a dollar bill and start on another one.

When the timer goes off, pencils down! Everyone reads off their list of anagrams, and the players vote on whether each one is a true confession. Majority rules. If an anagram is voted down, its player must return a buck to the bowl. 

Once everyone has shared their anagrams, start a new round. Play as many rounds as you wish. The winner is the player with the thickest bankroll at the end of the game.

## CREATIO EX NIHILO

```
CREATIO EX NIHILO

The big bang, birth of gods, mythical ages, ancient civilizations...

Come together with one or more creative friends to create a collaborative fictional universe. Take notes on paper, index cards, smartphones, etc.

Spontaneous Creation
Starting with the First Cycle, take turns describing concepts, ideas, and stories to add to the fiction, assigning them points based on a three-point scale.

*** 3 = big ideas, more permanent, powerful
 ** 2 = medium
  * 1 = small

Players begin each round with 3 points each, and may spend them in any order. Altering another player’s creation costs 1 more point than originally spent.

Re-Cycle?
Once all players have spent their points for a round, as a group decide whether to move on to a new cycle or continue another round in the current cycle.

Advance
Moving to a new cycle indicates the passage of time, possibly eons, and a narrowing of focus, with ideas getting smaller in scope and impact. 

Sample Cycles
1st - Universal Laws
2nd - Elder Gods
3rd - Galaxy, Stars, Time
4th - Sun, System, Planets
5th - Prime Planet
6th - Additional Celestial beings
7th - Geography, Climate
8th - Flora, Fauna
9th - Intelligent races
10th - Age of Myth
11th - Civilization

## Celestial Bureaucrats

```
God created the universe. She was assisted by millions of low-level bureaucrats, tasked with writing down the natural laws and the commandments for righteous living.

When the job was done, God dissolved the bureaucracy, put their souls into the wheel of reincarnation, and took her leave. She hasn’t been seen since.

Your character is a reincarnated bureaucrat today. Create your character by formulating one commandment (examples below) they helped write during creation and picking one domain from the list below. The commandments of the characters shouldn’t contradict.

The PCs cooperate to better the world by enforcing or promoting their commandments. You love yours the most, but are obligated to promote all PCs’ commandments.

Play is mostly freeform, with two exceptions. Actions that are significant have an even chance of success and characters have an even chance to create magical and supernatural effects within their domain. In both instances, flip a coin.

A game can be as long or short as you like. A good place to start is today's newspaper.


List of domains:
Animals
Fate
Earth
Emotions
Energy
Flesh
Thoughts
Weather

Example commandments
Animals mustn’t suffer
Children must know hope
No one shall rule over others
Everyone is equal

## Exodus - A game of discovery for 2-6 players

```
You are a group of humans sent to an empty alien ship to investigate. The aliens are gone, with no obvious cause.

Pick a specialty for your character (ie linguistics, physics, sociology, etc) and an area of the ship (ie. engineering, medical, cafeteria, gym, etc). Don’t overlap with other characters. There is no leader.

Take turns describing areas of the ship.

When it’s your turn- Answer the other player’s questions. Be obvious in your answers- if you don’t know, say that. Other players can make suggestions, but you get final say. When you’re ready, name one thing about the room that pertains to the disappearance and write it down on a notecard. Move to the next player.

When it’s not your turn- Ask about the room (ie. sight/smell/sound/etc). Think about what you’ve heard about other rooms and tie them together. You may suggest things, but the player whose turn it is gets final say.

Once all players have gone, look at the facts you’ve gathered about the disappearance. Do they fit into an order? Do they tell a story? Give each player a chance to offer their theory, but don’t identify any as true or right.
```

## Guilty Souls

```
     A small group of guilt ridden souls find themselves unwilling guests in a strange and foreign land.  The group must work together to survive the night as they face monstrous manifestations created from each soul’s personal guilt.  The phantoms feed on guilt, reflecting on past sins gives them more definition and power, but coming to terms with the past and forgiving yourself is the only way to truly defeat them.  

	Each souls’ presence will manifest at least 1 phantom, defeating all the phantoms or surviving 8 in game hours will allow the souls to be saved.
       
	The environment determines what weapons or tools the souls have available to use.  Weapons used by the souls always hit when circumstances allow. Weapons can only slow Phantoms.  Phantoms will always find and reach the Souls eventually.
       
	Absolving the soul of guilt normally requires revealing the sins to the group and the group successfully bringing the guilty soul to forgive themselves.  Souls must convince both the Storyteller and themselves to banish their Phantom.
       
	Time progresses per storyteller discretion. Players create their soul by writing short character backgrounds detailing the worst sins.

```
<hr> 

## Foresight

```
  In a time or moment of uncertainty, each member of a group of soothsayers receives a glimpse of the future and must predict what will happen. If they are certain of their own death, then they may die in peace. But if they are uncertain, their death will be exacerbated by fear and denial.

  Each player besides the GM plays as a soothsayer. The GM comes up with a scenario or story to place the soothsayers within and describes it to the players, then comes up with a future for that scenario and gives the players a vague clue about it. Based on that clue, the players come up with their own predictions for the future of that scenario. Whoever the GM decides has the most accurate prediction is awarded a point. (You could also play an alternative version where the GM decides based on which prediction they liked the most, regardless of accuracy).

  If a player predicts their character's death in their prediction, and they win the round, they are awarded double points. If they predict their character's death and lose the round, then they lose a point. The player with the most points at the end wins.

```
<hr> 

## The Delve

```
Describe your character in up to 6 sentences, devoting 1 or 2 to each:
- Their humdrum background
- Why they delve
- Their greatest fear
- Their equipment

Roll 3d6, and assign each die to one: Spirit, Endurance, and Skill. Name them.

Before setting out, create a single pool of tokens equalling the sum of the whole party’s Spirit scores.

To do something scary or challenging, spend 1 token; you and the GM each roll a d6. Group checks use a single roll that affects all participants. Depending on the circumstances, you may add a die and take the higher or lower. Rolls higher than the GM’s succeed. On a tie, you may spend a point of Skill to succeed; the GM determines the consequences for failure.

If the group runs out of Spirit, a character cannot go on; the party chooses which. The pool is refilled, without the Spirit of the fallen character.

If you become injured, exhausted, or spend time in pitch darkness, lose 1 Endurance. Upon reaching 0 Endurance, you die or are too hurt or demoralized to continue. Subtract your Spirit score from the pool.

If you come out with less than 100 gold per surviving character, you lose.

## Bloody Hair: A Tale of Barbaric Combat

```
Play as the hairy barbarians with the woolly underwear. Hairy barbarians are genderless. Hairy barbarians are found under rocks, and occasionally sprout from cabbages. Hairy barbarians do not speak. Hairy barbarians scream, point, grunt, and live to fight other hairy barbarians, hairless wizards, and beasts with sharp teeth in the desolate steppes and mountains of Sanguitor. Hairy barbarians fight in groups. Occasionally in dungeons too.

All dice used are d10s. A roll of 7, 8, 9 or 10 is a success. Statistics tests are resolved by rolling equal dice to the tested statistic's score. 

Someone has to be the Gamemaster.

Hairy Barbarian:
Statistics: Speed, Hairiness, Combat, Dodge. Assign 8, 6, 6, 4. Hit points = Hairiness + 2. Intelligence = 10 - Hairiness.

Generic Tooth-Beast:
Speed: 7, Combat: 6, Dodge: 6, Hit points: 5

Un-barbaric Actions:
Any action the player attempts that the GM deems too civilized will require at least one success on an Intelligence test. 

Combat:
Combatants act in Speed order. Attacker rolls Combat dice + Weapon dice versus defender's Dodge dice. Difference equals to hit points lost (if any).  

Weapon Examples:
Bone club: +1 Combat / +1 Speed, Obsidian sword: +2 Combat 

```
<hr> 

## Starship Basilisk

```
The starship Basilisk is crippled and venting atmosphere. The crew try desperately to repair her before the starship Hukatis returns to finish them.

Place 4 d6s on the table with the 1 side up. Each time a player takes a significant action such as repairing or using a major system reroll the d6 with the lowest face up value. On a 6 another problem arises related to a major system (roll a d6). (Eg: fried circuits, ruptured hull, damaged power conduit, injured crewmembers.) After every 4 actions increment the highest (non-6) die. When the total shown on the dice reaches 20+ the Hukatis returns and attacks. Reset all four dice, then continue as before but roll twice after each action. If the total reaches 20+ the Basilisk is destroyed.

Actions: roll a d6, succeed on 3+

Major systems:
(1) Life support -must be repaired within 4 rounds
(2) Reactor -required for engines, weapons & shields
(3) Engines -use successfully 3 times to escape
(4) Weapons -use successfully on Hukatis 3 times to destroy it
(5) Shields -roll only once after each action while active
(6) Escape Pods -abandon ship!

Each system starts broken. A system cannot be used twice consecutively.

## Repair Bots!

```
Welcome to Frontier Station on the edge of known space. Your programming has been downloaded into a repair bot chassis. Take a moment to settle in while your orientation commences.

Frontier Station is home to thousands who all depend on you. As repair bots, you will be directed to the malfunctions, damages, and dangers that frequently occur aboard this station.

When you encounter a situation, activate your repair module (roll a d6) and attempt to remedy the problem (4+ is a success). Be careful, failure can introduce errors into your programming (take 1 degradation per failure). Too many errors and your repair module will downgrade (3 degradation reduces the die size, d4 downgraded equals destruction).

Successful repair bots learn (take 1 adaptation per success) and improve their systems (adaptation points equal to half the next die tier upgrades the current die, i.e. 4 for d8, to a max of d12). With each successful upgrade, all errors are purged from your programming.

The Station Controller (GM) will direct you to damaged areas, dangerous outbreaks, alien encounters, and any other problems that may arise on Frontier Station. 

Orientation complete. Please proceed to section 27 where the reactor coolant is leaking again.

## Sonnet 155: A Murder Most Foul

```
The King has met an awful, bloody fate!
The Court is calling heroes brave and true
To solve the case and help our vengeance sate;
A golden bounty paid for justice due.
With friends most trusted gather ‘round the room
(With paper, pens, perhaps a rhyming book)
And set the stage; the court, the death, the gloom,
‘Til such a time that action must be took.
The player taking action takes the page
And tries to craft iambic verse ideal.
With action written, player takes the stage
And reads the words for judgment fair and real.
For each iambic line you claim success.
With 14 lines you put the case to rest.
```

## The Protector

```
Strange things happen at your high school. One girl fights from the shadows - unexplainable power against unknown horrors. She will deny it. But you see glimpses… you hear rumors.
 
Whisper. 
Share a time you, or a friend, were helped by The Protector. Shroud your retelling in uncertainty but hint at the extraordinary. Ask others for more detail. At the end, another player names a power they now believe The Protector has. Write it down. Draw a playing card and place it, face down, beside the power. Repeat, each sharing a story in turn, until she has eight rumored powers.
 
Witness. 
Choose someone to play the Ultimate Foe that opposes The Protector. All other players witness this battle - describing The Protector as she fights, unequivocally in public for the first time. As players describe the use of a power, they flip the card relating to that power. If the card is black, The Protector can use that power. If it is red, the gossip was false, the Ultimate Foe makes the situation worse.
 
Win or lose. 
When the last card is flipped, gather and shuffle them. Draw one. If it is black, The Protector succeeds.
 
See the battle to its end.

## Dodgy Gods: A Game of Tricksters and Trouble

```
Create your Gods - each choose:
1-2 purviews: war, wisdom, spring, law, etc. One god takes “Trickster”.
2-3 attributes: qualities, items, servants.
1-2 weaknesses: naive, proud, greedy, etc. 

Create your World:
Your purviews, combined, are the natural order - what is important and just. Together, describe your world. 
Trickster, describe 2-3 outsiders: monsters, mysteries, perils.

Gods, embody your purviews, attributes and weaknesses. Be awesome, awful, fallible and straightforward. 
Trickster, make mischief. Help them, but have a good laugh on the way. Look for comedy and paradox. 

Everyone, be nice.

Play:
Trickster, describe a normal day, then:

Approach 1-2 gods (other players: make cameo appearances, take up other characters);

Tell them how something is amiss. You can: 
Steal an attribute;
Upset the natural order;
Involve outsiders;
Target weaknesses;

Together, go out to put things right:

Trickster also introduces mischief, obstacles and opportunities.

Anyone may ask: "Trickster, is it your fault? Do we know that?"

Gods always succeed when within their purview AND with an attribute. Exceptions: against a weakness, gods need another’s help to succeed; when violating the natural order gods can succeed, but with consequences. 

Gods cannot die;

Solve the problem, return home. Describe scars, embarrassments, grudges, and lessons learned.

```
<hr> 

## Janitors, Night Shift and It

```
3+ Janitors
Take as many playing cards as players, with one joker and one king.  Shuffle and draw one each.
The Janitor that draws the Joker is the maker; they made or found It. They can dictate How It Works.
The Janitor that draws the King is the agent; they must Deal With It. They can dictate how It must be Dealt With.
The Janitor that most recently worked overtime is the Finder; they were the first to see it.
Everyone else is just a Janitor, they want to get back to cleaning.
The Finder goes first, and describes what It is, why it shouldn’t be there, and what happened at first.
The Finder brings Janitors in, one at a time, to see It.
Should conflict arise, thumb wrestle and decide based on result.
The Maker and the Agent may reveal themselves at any point (to explain How It Works or How To Deal With It), but must be opposed.
Anyone who dies in the line of janitorial duty must leave, fetch a beverage, and return to watch the events unfold.
Play ends when all Janitors agree the situation has been resolved and continue to clean, or are dead.

## The Four Gates: A Mindful RPG

```
In The Four Gates: A Mindful RPG, social and physical conflicts are resolved through the guidance of The Four Gates, an ancient method of mindful action.  It can be played in any setting with any type of character.  The four gates words and actions may pass through are:

Are they true?
Are they necessary?
Are they helpful?
Are they kind?

For each question that is answered "yes," one six-sided die (d6) is added to a dice pool.  

The maximum dice pool is 4d6.  The dice are added together and compared to the target number of 8.  If the roll is greater than 8, the player's action resolves the conflict (the argument has ended, the physical fight has finished, etc.). If the roll is 8 or less, the action does not resolve the conflict and the situation continues. 

For each question to be answered "yes," the player must declare the action or words and present evidence explaining why they pass through that particular gate.  Either the GameMaster or another player may determine that the evidence presented is insufficient and deny use of that gate; unanimous table consensus is required, and table discussion is encouraged to ensure character actions are mindful.

## What You Carry

```
Awaken and fall through the bottom of your grave.
You do not remember, but you know. This is a place of tests, trials, tribulations.
If you wish to be free from wretched mortality, you must not fail here.
Your face is: 1{ Naked Bones } 2{ Drooping Flesh } 3{ Golden* Mask } 4{ Pale Fire }
Your skin is the starry night sky.
An impossible spire leers across surreal landscapes. Atop it lies salvation.
 
Roll 1d4 (material) and 1d6 (object-type) 3x to determine the grave goods you carry.
1. Golden* {} Axe
2. Stone  {} Bowl
3. Bronze {} Candle
4. Driftwood {} Oranges
5. {} Sickle
6. {} Amphora
*Golden objects are unbreakable, coveted. Candles and Oranges function as normal, unless golden.
 
Doing things:
Players Roll 1d20 vs. GM 3d6 to accomplish difficult tasks. Easy tasks can be assumed successful. Players take tied rolls.
For each useful object a character employs, roll an additional d20. Take the highest result. Max of 3 d20s.
Characters have only 7 after-lives. Deadly tasks destroy underworld bodies upon failure.
If an item could conceivably be sacrificed to save an after-life, so be it.
Characters reform at dawn, wherever they fell.
```
<hr> 

## Too Many Love!

```
Each Player but one portrays a Suitor. The last portrays the Love Interest. All Players start with 3 Damage; each Damage has a name, chosen by the Player. The Love Interest always gets “Dense” and “Unremarkable,” but can choose the final one.

The Love Interest also serves as the Game Master, creating the scenarios that everyone role-plays. These scenarios should give every Suitor a fair chance to resolve a plot complication with a Challenge: roll a six-sided die.
1 = Botch; complication worsened or is created. 
2 or 3 = Failure.
4 or 5 = Resolved.
6 = Overboard; resolves complication but creates another.

If a Suitor’s Damage(s) could affect the Challenge, each adjusts the roll by 1, as judged by the Game Master.

If a Suitor resolves a complication that they created with a Botch or Overboard, they remove any Damage that affected it. Suitors may also assist, but an assistant only removes Damage that worsened the complication. However, the Love Interest only removes Damage if a Suitor assists.

When the Love Interest has no Damage, the game ends. The Suitor who removes the most total Damage wins.

## When the Wolves Come...

```
“In the Spring, the wolves come down from the hills. Too fast for bullets, too hungry for knives. Stay behind the barricades, and keep the fire high.”
Society has fallen and the wolves came. You’ve been sheltered in your small community, but now supplies are low. Scout the area, spot ways to survive.
Go for a walk. 30 minutes to an hour. Take a friend or two. Before you go, give each survivor an index card. Write a role in your survivor community. Pass the cards around. Write a place you could be safe from the wolves for a night. Pass cards again. Write a thing you could scavenge to help your community survive longer. Mix up the cards and pass them out.
On your walk, walk briskly. Take some water. Look out for things on your card. Spot them and tell the others how you think it would help.  Remember, it will all be ruined, broken. Wolves are fast, strong, and many. Make a note and move on.
Afterword, talk about what you saw. Then vote who fulfilled their role the best. They choose where you walk next time.

## Strands of Fate

```
It is a time of myths and legends. Before you lie two cotton threads, each one metre long.

Each of you is a deity, responsible for an important concept (like Love, or Honour) and two Chosen Ones, OR two minor concepts/elements (like Fire, or Hospitality) and one Legendary Hero.

The Heroes and Chosen Ones are your pawns in a story of adventure, betrayal, magic, and secrets. A pawn chosen by fate--a roll of the dice--is the protagonist. A deity chosen by fate creates a sacred artifact that the protagonist must find. Another deity chosen by fate is the antagonist, and works to prevent the protagonist's success. Other deities choose their own paths, and should make bargains. Tell each other the tale.

Whenever there is conflict or the opportunity for interesting failure, two deities wrap the ends of a chosen thread around their fingers, and pull sharply to break it. Whoever ends with the longer piece succeeds--the shorter piece means a setback. If the pieces are the same length, someone is granted a boon. Both pieces of thread are returned to the table. If the thread doesn't break, there is a catastrophe.
```
<hr> 

## Spelling

```
Words contain forbidden power. 

You are a WIZARD. You have a SPELLBOOK made of a journal, folded paper, notecards, or whatever you like. 

Draw a SYMBOL and assign a SPELL ASPECT to it: a triangle for fire, a circle for binding, an arrow for movement, whatever you like. Be creative, but keep the symbols simple. 

There is a surface (paper, whiteboard, etc)  on the table that everyone can draw on. 

Spells are made by DRAWING SYMBOLS on the surface. Combine the symbols creatively and explain what the spell does to solve your problem. Combine as many as you like. 

EXAMPLE: A triangle inside a circle binds fire in place to stop a building from burning down. 

Wizards can work together and combine their symbols to make stronger spells. 

The GM creates a problem and writes down a WORD, invoking its forbidden power. Wizards use their magic symbols, but be wise: you can only use a symbol three times a day. 

Wizards start with FIVE SYMBOLS. When you get stronger or gain a level, add two more symbols. 

OPTIONAL: Colors have SPELL ASPECTS. Start with two colors, gain one per level. Beware, the GM can use colors as well. 


```
<hr> 

## Reteller

```
The objective of the game is to collectively narrate a quirky retelling of a story. Choose a story every player is familiar with, for example an iconic movie. 

 - Each player writes down, in secret, 9 words. Only nouns and verbs. Optionally agree on disqualified common words, like 'do', 'go' and 'thing'.
 - Each player writes down, in secret, 3 scenes from the story.
 - Select a narrator who will start the retelling.
 - If the narrator uses a word you wrote down, you score the word. Reveal the word to everyone. You are now the narrator.
 - If several players had the same word, every player discards the word from the game without scoring it. The current narrator resumes his narration.
 - If the narrator uses a revealed word (he may use his own hidden words), he loses a scored word, if he has one.
 - If the narrator skips a scene you wrote down, reveal the scene. You remove two random hidden words from the narrator. You are now the narrator.
 - A player who loses all of his words, he drops from the game.
 - Once the story ends, applaud the player with the most scored words. Compliment the narrator with the best euphemisms.

## Prankster's Dillema

```
Who put a goat in the cafeteria?!?! The morning after Senior Prank Day, someone is taking the fall...

One player is the Principal, trying to catch em all. The remaining players are Students, all of whom organized a prank but don't want to be held back from graduating. 

Three phases;

Pranks: Students each secretly send a text to another Student with a prank they organized and a random detail about it. Anyone who gets a text copies that text to the Principal, thus hiding the culprit but establishing a witness.

Planning: Everyone does whatever else outside of this game for the next hour+ (party, game, etc.) while Students pin down alibis and allies. When talking about anything in game, Students can ONLY communicate with other Students via texts.

Punishment: Eventually gather everyone together. The Principal tries to figure out blame, while Students try to get away with whatever they did. Players can say or do anything their character might. 

After 15 mins of investigating the Principal assigns blame for all pranks. The Principal wins if they correctly blame more Students than they get wrong. Any Student who wasn't correctly blamed also wins, but ONLY if the Principal has won too.

## Complication

```
A quick, competitive storytelling game for two people.
Needed: playing cards

-

Sit across from each other with a shuffled deck of cards between you. The younger player establishes the scene and at least one character, “The camera opens upon...”/ “Once upon a time….”  Do not yet introduce plot or problems.
 
Now take turn drawing cards, one at a time, face-up.

(BLACK cards are scene cards). Expand upon the scene by adding detail or characters.  Continue until a RED card is drawn; now the game changes.  

(RED cards are complication cards). Introduce a new problem or obstacle. Describe how things become worse. Continue until a BLACK card is drawn.

(Now BLACK cards are solution cards). Describe a solution that ties up all loose ends and resolves all complications.

- If you cannot describe a satisfactory solution, pass.  The story continues. 
- If the other player draws a RED card, they add a new complication and the story continues.
- If a BLACK follows a successful BLACK, the story has reached its end. Mark a point for yourself.  Start again, “Once upon a time…”

Play to 5 points, or whatever. 

-

Alternately: Flip a coin/roll a die.  Heads/evens= BLACK.  Tails/odds= RED. 

```
<hr> 

## The Devil on my Shoulder

```
GM takes a deck of cards.  Remove the jokers.  Deal each player 1 face up.

Red cards are demons.  Black cards are human heroes.  Demons exist in the minds of humans.  Heroes are trying to right wrongs.  Demons are trying to prevent that.  Redeal if there isn’t at least one of each.

Each player receives 4 more cards.  These and the face up card go into their hand.

GM sets the scene and the goals.  Play begins.  

Demons cannot take actions.  Heroes’ actions succeed automatically, unless a demon challenges.  During a challenge, both players play a card face down and flip them at the same time.  Highest card wins. (Aces are high)  Discard the highest card, winner takes the lowest card.  Do not draw back up.  If a demon wins, they take control of the human, the hero may challenge later to regain control.   If the hero wins, they maintain control and succeed the action.

If a demon runs out of cards, they are banished from the hero and can no longer challenge.  If a hero runs out of cards, the demon has fully taken over the hero.  

Players may be dealt back in as the GM sees need.

## Wannabe Legend

```
As a rookie Cape, to make an impression is as important as succeeding at your task. Without the awe of the mundanes you might just as well keep working retail. 

Capes have powers. 
1, choose your Talent. Keep it simple. (Example: Flight.) 
2, choose three Schticks - cool moves or practiced applications of your Talent (examples: Hover, Turbulence). 
3, the other players each make up an Expansion (upgrades to your Talent, like Supersonic Flight) and a Flop (power fizzle) for you.
 
The two main Stats of the game are Succeeding and Impressing. Divide 8 points between them. 
Then Skills. Divide 10 points between 5 Skills of your choice (1-3 points per skill).

For each roll, use 2 different 10-sided dice. One for determining Success, one for Impression. To the dice result you add respective Stat, +points per Skill and +3 per Schtick (describe how they correspond). 
Dice result: Succeeding / Impressing
8 or lower: Failure / Boring
9-17: Success / Impressive
18 or higher: Triumph / Spectacular
Spectacular Failures triggers a Flop, while Spectacular Triumph grants you an Expansion for a while. Boring Failures will lower your popularity, but anything Spectacular raises it. 

Protectors of Terra are looking for new recruits. Show them your mettle.

## The Mug Is Half...

```
A Solo RPG

You play a character who is drinking a much needed cup of coffee. Think about why you NEED coffee right now and how you will take it.

Put one die in your hand when you are ready to drink. If you add real sugar, put another die in your hand. If you add cream put another die in your hand. If you add anything else at all: (ice, syrup, cinnamon, low-cal sweetener, coconut milk), take a die out of your hand if you are holding more than one.

Roll and choose the highest die. 

1: The coffee is dark and bitter. It gives you resolve and a razor-edge clarity to face the abyss.

2-3: The mug is empty. Your mind was so full of other thoughts that you drink the coffee without even tasting it. 

4-5: Ah, coffee! Your problems briefly melt away, but come crashing back in when the last sip is gone.

6: The coffee is rich and flavorful. Life is sweet! Even if it sometimes seems overwhelming.

You can drink another cup and reroll, but you must re-roll any 1s or 6s one time.

## Hopes and Traumas

```
You are adventurers, vagrants, murderhobos. Make up why you work together.
You just left the dungeon. Are you wounded? Was it a success? It’s time to come back to Town and rest. 

Player: Create a character.

Adventurer’s nickname.
Profession [fighter, wizard, rogue].
When I sense danger I always [draw sword, attack from surprise, cast spell, other].
In town I look for [love, medical help, absolution, oblivion, respect, other].
Before the game choose a number between 2 and 9. 

During play:
Say what you do and what you want to get and roll 1d10.
Roll number or above to act Forceful. Roll number or lower to Resist. 
Success: you do it and get what you want. 
Failure: something goes badly, GM will tell you what. 
If your profession is relevant, expect that you couldn’t control your strenght: the consequences are unexpected and undesirable.

GM: 
Ask about their dreams and traumas.
Paint the town as sleepy and nice.
Present townsfolk as friendly.
Present townsfolk as anxious.
Ask about the people they meet.
Offer deceptive promises.
Provoke with deceptive danger. 
Limit what they may achieve.

## Dream Eaters

```
The Dreamers are caught in web of a Dream-Eater, and the only way out is to defeat the monster in the dreamscape.
Set-Up
One player is the Eater. The others are Dreamers.
The Dreamers establish the dreamscape and describe their actions. These are their dreams, after all.
Mechanics
Dreamers can manipulate the dream world. They may suddenly fly or whip up a tornado. The only limit is that they must follow dream logic and ‘feel’ right.
Each time they do so the Eater gains one Subversion Point (SP). The Eater may spend these as such:
3SP – Subvert: When a Dreamer manipulates the dream world the Eater may modify it in any way want. For example, if a Dreamer wants to turn a cloud into a marshmallow their teeth may fall out when they bite it.
6SP – Manipulate: The Eater manipulates the world in the same fashion as a Dreamer.
12SP – Reality Break: The Eater manipulates the world with no need to follow dream logic.
Victory/Defeat
The Dreamers aim is to find the Eater and defeat it without being subverted.
The Eater tracks all the SP spent. If this totals more than 80 the Dreamers are defeated.

## STUDIO RETROSPECTIVE

```
STUDIO RETROSPECTIVE is a half-hour interview show on public television, spotlighting accomplished actors. Their fame defies introduction — instead, our sense of them emerges through play.

Divide these roles:
-- 1 Host
-- 1 Star
-- 2 Performers (for larger groups, add more Performers)

Each player contributes the following prompts:
-- 5x dramatic character motivations
-- 3x locations
-- 2x headlines
Collect these, sorted & unread.

Playing an episode follows this outline:

INTRO. [1min]
-- Opening pleasantries! Establish Host & Star in broad strokes.
FIRST CLIP. [2mins]
-- Within a clip, one Performer acts as the Star. Rotate which Performer embodies the Star between clips. (With 3+ Performers, also decide who the clip includes.) Performers: take motivations. Host: take a location, set a 2-minute timer, & open the clip by saying “SCENE: [location].” Performers improvise the clip using their motivations until time expires.
STUDIO. [3mins]
-- Host & Star discuss the previous clip.
SECOND CLIP. [2mins]
STUDIO. [4mins]
-- Discuss! Host: at some point, introduce a headline about the Star. (Imagine an article, magazine cover, etc. appearing onscreen.)
THIRD CLIP. [2mins]
STUDIO. [3mins]
-- Discuss!
FOURTH CLIP. [2mins]
STUDIO. [4mins]
-- Discussion, + another new headline.
FIFTH CLIP. [2mins]
STUDIO. [5mins]
-- Discussion, + a final headline. As the scene concludes, wrap up with a brief outro.

Roll credits!

## Amnesia Llamas

```
Needed: 4-6 players, small toy water guns, note cards, writing utensils.

Each player writes down the names of three famous people (fictional or real) onto note cards. Cards are shuffled and one is given to each player. Players hold their card face out so they can’t see their true identity. Each player is given a water gun to enable the ability to ‘spit’ on other llamas.

You were all once celebrities/historical figures. You have ended up together at a petting zoo, transformed into llamas. You cannot remember your original identities.

Everyone must figure out who they are. You are not allowed to ask questions (with one exception, noted below); rather, you must make statements to the group. If your statement is something the group believes your true identity would or could say, they should ‘spit’ on you. The group may not give spoken hints. If too many llamas talk at once, people will become suspicious. The only questions allowed are formal identity guesses. Each llama may make only three formal guesses per game.

The game ends when all llamas successfully guess their true identity, use their three guesses, or run out of spit.

```
<hr> 

## Chieftain

```
2-6 players.

Place a handful of paperclips in the center of the table.  For each player, add five additional paperclips. The paperclips are resources from the local mine.

Each player starts with a d6 with 3 face up in front of them.  This represents the population of their village.

Go around the table clockwise, and say when you were last angry enough to yell or slam your fist. The player to the left of the most recently angry player begins.

On a player's turn, she uses a number of adventures equal to one more than their town's population.

Each adventure may be used in one of three ways:

- Take a resource from the mine.
- Turn one of your resources into a weapon by folding it into a spear.
- Discard a resources to gain a population, up to six.
- Attack another player with any number of your spears:

The attacker choses any number of their spears to attack.
The defender uses any number of their resources as shields.
The defender discards their used shields. The attacker discards an equal number of their attacking spears.
The defender loses population equal to the number of remaining attacking spears.

## Triumphs and Disasters

```
IF

“If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same”

                             Rudyard Kipling

YOU

You reside in Victorian India. Write and share two sentences about your character:

1. Your most remarkable Triumph to date, about which you are self-effacing.
2. Your most regrettable Disaster thus far, about which you are stoical.

CAN MEET

Discuss and note your personal or common adversaries: dastardly individuals, diabolical societies, frightful locations, scandalous situations, any combinations.

WITH TRIUMPH AND DISASTER

Write two sentences to describe the possible consequences of a precarious undertaking which brings your character up against one or more adversary:

1. Triumph, fulfilling your desires and manifesting your virtues.
2. Disaster, thwarting your designs and exposing your frailties.

AND TREAT THOSE TWO IMPOSTORS JUST THE SAME

Toss a coin for your character:

Heads: Triumph.
Tails: Disaster.

Take it in turns to set the scene, and play out the events leading up to your character's Triumph or Disaster. Involve other players as allies or adversaries. Have them play their own characters where appropriate.

Keep a stiff upper lip, come what may. Record your Triumph or Disaster as experience.

For a solo game write all stages. Publish periodically.

## SHAKESPEAREAN WORLD

```
it’s gmless apocalypse world but shakespeare.

the game occurs acts. each act there is a different gm; everyone gets to go once. introduce the game by setting the stage. everyone introduces themselves, and then everyone points to everyone else and declares that they either hate or love that person. for everyone you hate, add 1 to hate. for everyone you love, add 1 to love. (max +3)

each scene, the gm picks two characters and gives a question they must try to answer by the end of the act. other characters may enter as they see fit.

when you act to build or show affection, roll +love. on a +10, tell the other person something they now believe. on a 7-9, exchange things you now believe. on a miss, -1 love, +1 hate.

when you act to oppose or suppress another, roll +hate. on a 10+, forbid the other person from doing something. on a 7-9, exchange taboos. on a miss, +1 love, -1 hate.

once everyone has gone, play a final act with all characters. a 10+ on love results in a marriage. a 10+ on hate results in a death. either way, the play then ends.

## Wizards of the Tome

```
The source of every wizard's power is their spellbook.

Each player needs a book with titled chapters to play. This is a spellbook. Choose one player to be the Game Master; they will dictate the plot. Everyone else is a powerful wizard.

Each chapter title is a spell. On seperate pieces of paper, each player except for the GM must write the spell names from the book they brought and their effect based on that name. Be strange, be vile, be secretive.

Pass the paper to the GM and the spellbook to another wizard. Only the GM knows what a spell does; players should not share the effects they made. The players now have their spellbooks. Going around in a circle, each player introduces themselves along with a character trait based on the title of their spellbook.

The GM narrates a plot based on the chapter titles of their own book, starting at chapter one. The players narrate their own actions. They may cast each spell from their spellbook once. These are considered to automatically succeed, but if a wizard wishes to do something else difficult they must flip a coin. On a heads they succeed at the task.

## The Holy Mountain

```
You are pilgrims. You carry burdens, wear concealing clothing, and seek absolution for a transgression. You climb a mountain, visiting shrines linked by perils. 

Pilgrims must not:
Speak of life outside.
Speak of the trail ahead.
Show their face.
Invoke their ancestors.

Start at the first shrine. In turn give the shrine keeper something from your pack and say how it fulfils their requirements. Then together perform the purification ritual.

During the ritual you break one prohibition you haven't broken before:

Your life: Describe your home. Say one thing you regret leaving behind.
The trail: Warn of danger and say why you turned back last time.
Ancestors: Receive an otherworldly item, described by the others.
Your face: Reveal your transgression.

Then you leave the shrine and travel onwards. One pilgrim describes how the next peril endangers them. Another pilgrim describes a skill/tool they use to protect them, and what it implies. Repeat until you reach the next shrine.

When you reach the fifth and final shrine, you may enter or turn back. Pilgrims that enter are never seen again.

Shrines demand:
Anger
Greed
Pride
Grief

Purification through:
Sparring
Fasting
Bathing
Poisoning.

Perils:
Wildlife
Cliffs
Blizzards
Exhaustion.

## Moth

```
1-5 players
Approximately 12 minutes
You will need: A large piece of paper, pens, four three-minute songs

Play the first song. You start your lives as eggs.
Squeeze your body into itself as much as it physically can. Keep the piece of paper close enough so it can be reached between you and other players. Tear off a piece of the paper and write one word that expresses how you’re feeling as an egg. Fold and leave the note near where you’re positioned.

When the next song plays, crawl out of your shell as a larvae.
Stretch your body out of the position it was in as an egg. If you can, crawl around the room. Otherwise, move very slowly. Greet other larvae.

When the next song plays, solidify into a pupa.
Lay down, if you can. If not, stay very still.

When the next song plays, break out of your shells and flutter around the room as moths.
Sometimes, you may stop to open and read a note on the floor.

When the fourth song ends, each of you are reaching the end of your lives and you slowly fall to the ground.

## Liar

```
You are going to roleplay with someone without their consent. Without their consent or knowledge. Because they don't know they're part of your game, you don't get a pass on the fiction you're going to present. You will lie, and to that person, you will be a liar. They may never find out, and the interaction might still be a net win for them, but it will be true that you were not.

You can be anyone you choose—other than yourself—provided that the thought to choose them does not occur to you before your interaction begins.

Everything you say, your character believes implicitly. They're not some filthy liar.

There are two ways to win:
The conversation ends with your target better off and unsuspecting.
Your mark calls you on your bullshit; you apologize and tell them about roleplaying.
All other results are a loss.

Afterward, think about the value of truth, and how you tried to help your victim.
Is it better to lie to help someone, or to say nothing?
How did lying-for-real feel?
Was your emotional cost worth their gain?
What did you learn about your victim? Do you believe that?
What of your character will you keep?
```
<hr> 

## Hello - The Game

```
Have you ever been confused about how to greet someone? This is a game about that.
Before we start there are some things to decide:
Are you Social/shy?(Each player pick one)
Decide what the social context is. At a gamecon maybe?
Each one of you roll 1d6 – if you’re social add +1 to result (hidden from the other player)

1: You avoid any approach at a physical greeting.
2 : Handshake.
3: Half Hug - A quick wrap, lightly touching your partner where your arms only go halfway around.
4: Friendly hug - Put your arms lightly around your partner's shoulders and give a gentle squeeze.
5: Bear hug - Pull your partner in really close, put your arms completely around them, and squeeze tight.
6: Kiss on cheek (as many as you want, but decide before).
 
Play:
1.       The Social character goes first. Describe the budding signs of the gesture you're about to make.
2.       The shy character can now +/- 1 to die result. Describe how that looks.
3.       Play out the rest of the hug from each player's perspective (include inner monologue).
4.       Start the ensuing conversation and keep going until you think your done.

## Sync

```
You have memories and feelings you don’t want, but thanks to the revolutionary Sync process, you can change that!+ 

Sync is best with 4+ players in a plain, live action form. 

Each player begins with 2 Memories, 2 Emotions, 1 Goal. All Memories and Emotions should be created collectively, so Goals are attainable. 

- A Memory is a specific event, e.g., “My father’s death.”

- An Emotion is a feeling. Default Emotion List: Anger, Joy, Sorrow, Fear, Desire. Add more if you like.

- Each Memory has 1 Emotion associated with it to start.

- A Goal is the Memory/Emotion combination the character most desires. For example, “My father’s death/Sorrow.”  You cannot begin with both parts. 

Each Session, a player may Bond with one or two players. This allows transfer of 1 Memory or 1 Emotion for each player. For example, one player in the Bond may pass Sorrow to the other, while the other player gives her “Wedding day” memory. All parties must share. 

Sync sharing is as emotional and intimate as it sounds. Be brave.

Bonds cannot be forced. Be persuasive. 

There are 3 Sessions per Sync cycle, 15 minutes each. 

+Satisfaction not guaranteed.

## Might Makes Right: Muscle Marines in Space

```
You are Muscle Marines, charged with keeping the universe awesome.

Setup
The strongest player is the Muscle Master (MM), who runs the game, describing situations and people. 

Everyone else is a Muscle Marine. Name your Marine and write down four personality traits, six skills, and a Muscle Marine Profession (e.g. Muscle Pilot, Muscle Negotiator, Muscle Tactician).
 
Conflict
When you are in conflict, arm wrestle the MM. If a skill or profession applies to the conflict, use your good arm, otherwise use your bad arm (when mismatched, use palm to back of hand). If you win, your character overcomes the obstacle. If you lose, do 10 push-ups (seven if you are roleplaying a personality trait) and continue play. If you can’t finish the full set, you must hit the showers and are out of the game.
 
Muscle Missions
1.       Rescue a space gym from the Evil Beancounter Alliance.
2.       Help the Fitness Federation move into a cool new pad.
3.       Throw a Spacetacular party for your buds at the beach (watch out for space sharks).

## Superstition
A PBTA Add-on

```
Mundane gestures can bring good fortune or bad luck.  The GM may ask: “What behavior do you witness here that is an act based on superstition?”

Characters have a new stat.: BELIEF
The GM will ask: “Do you believe in superstitions and why is that so?”
Players assign a modifier to their Belief stat: -1, 0, or +1 (Unbelieving, Uncertain, or Superstitious.)

Tempting Fate
When you are involved in a known popular superstition, roll+BEL
*On a 12+, same as a 10+ result and you may raise or lower your Belief by one. (-3/+3 max)
*On a 10+, gain two Good Fortune or Bad Luck holds.
*On a 7-9, gain one Good Fortune or Bad Luck hold.
*On a miss, you may raise or lower your Belief by one.

Spend a Good Fortune holds to gain Advantage on your next roll.
The GM may spends one of your Bad Luck hold to impose Disadvantage on your next roll.
He may ask at any time how many Bad Luck holds you currently have.
Good and Bad holds may cancel one another out.

Advantage: roll 3 dices, keep the two best results.
Disadvantage: roll 3 dices, keep the two worst results.

## The Spirits Somnia

```
You are training to be a Somnia, a deliverer of dreams.  Each night you fly through the gates of sleep to deliver dreams.  If you gain four or more nightmare points in seven nights, you will not become a Somnia.

Your Somnia has three traits.  You may put all three traits towards one type or chose a mix from either.

Horn [Truthful, Calming, Terrifying]
Ivory [Deceitful, Cunning, Soothing]

The gate you enter determines the type of dream delivered.  Roll one six-sided die (1d6) for the gate.

(4-6) Horn Gate – Prophetic Dreams
(1-3) Ivory Gate – False Dreams

Once you have a gate, describe and deliver your dream.  

Roll 1d4 for the number of nouns you must weave into your dream description.  If playing alone pick nouns from around you; if playing with others, they provide the nouns.

Roll 1d4 for each noun in the dream.  The sum of those roles is the dream number.  When delivering the dream, roll 3d6 dice.  For each trait you have for a gate, add or subtract two points to your delivering roll.  If the sum is 1-3 away from the dream number, the delivery was a success.  Otherwise gain one nightmare point.
```

## Astrum Arcanis

```
You are a starship, launched across space by the Cthonian Empress to defend her interests. Millenia later, she is gone and her monuments crumble — but you still wander the vacuum, banded together with other lost warships. Derelict and without purpose, how much longer can you survive the cold void?

Players:
Divide a Tarot Deck into decks for Major Arcana and individual suits.
Draw three cards from the Major Arcana. Use them as prompts to define your ship’s 
       Original Purpose, Weapons, and Body.

Ships have four stats: 
       Hull (Cups), Weapons (Swords), AI (Wands), and Flight (Pentacles).
Assign to each stat a value: (3), (3), (2), (2). Draw that number of cards from the appropriate suit’s deck.

The Cold Void’s Goals:
         Confront with forces seeking to destroy and demoralize.
         Emphasize loneliness.
         Encourage sacrifice.

Narrate with players where they are, what they’re doing. Continue until conflict arises or a player risks serious failure. If a ship refuses to back down, assign a challenge number 1-10. Player must discard a card—if they cannot meet or beat the challenge with an appropriate card, narrate failure. On success, draw a new card if available from the deck. Damage systems until the fleet falls apart.


```
<hr> 

## G.L.U.R.P.S.

```
Name thyself. Choose a main deal (pirate, wizard, spy, whatever). Google image search for a look.

Choose two things you're especially good at and write them on your sheet (be specific: two words for each, not just one!). They can be related to your deal or not. Choose one thing you're bad at. 

When you face an obstacle, roll dice or flip coins. Evens or heads are successes. Roll just one for a straightforward task (like stabbing a guy). Two or three for a more complex or difficult one (like disarming a bomb). 

For each thing you're good at that applies to the situation, reroll a failure. You can choose to reroll another if it falls inside your main deal. For a thing you're bad at, reroll a success. 

If you rolled neither all successes nor all failures, you got mixed results. For each success, narrate something that went right. For each failure, something that didn't. Failures lead to pain and new complications.

If you get three successes straight up doing something you weren't (yet) good at: now you are! Add it to your sheet and keep on truckin’. 
```
<hr> 

## Sonder

```
Go on a walk with some fellow players to a crowded place. Take photos of your group and the surroundings and then gather around a table.

Each player chooses a person from one of their photos (your “Stranger”).  Take turns inventing details about your Stranger, one detail at a time, such as:

Name
Favors
Partners
Children
Hometown
Kindest act
Favorite movie
Medical condition
Dream occupation
Losses and heartaches
Relationship with another Stranger
What they wanted to be when they grew up
Friend they’ve had a falling out with
Proudest achievement
Current occupation
Last vacation spot
Favorite book
Cruelest act
Aspirations
Hobbies
Siblings
Debts
Age

Anything else you can imagine.

When you are all satisfied, show everyone the photo of your Stranger.

Take a moment to talk about how each of you is but a Stranger to the hundreds of people you interact with or pass by each day.

Each person you see has a life and dreams as rich and vibrant as your own. How does this make you feel? Do you know these kinds of details about the other players? If not, are they just Strangers too? Share details about yourselves.
```
<hr> 

## ReWritten

```
This is a game for two, about a subject of a secret supersoldier program, who regained his memories and tries to break free. The player creates a personal Goal that the Soldier pursues (love, revenge, debt, guilt, whatever). Work out the details together. The GM creates interesting Challenges throughout the game.

You are in a lab. You don’t know how you got here. Fill in the Profile below to create your Soldier. Whenever you have to take on a Challenge, roll a D6. Find a sentence in the Profile that makes the Challenge easier or harder. Add 1 or subtract 1 from the roll, respectively.  The GM does the same with another sentence. On a score of 4+ you succeed and are closer to reaching your Goal. Otherwise a problem emerges. 

After each Challenge, part of your memory is overwritten (the GM changes one sentence in the Profile).

If you fail three Challenges in a row, you are recaptured and the game ends. If you overcome a total of 6 Challenges, you achieve your Goal (but can play on, until you are recaptured).
 

My friends call me…

I am…

I hate…

I love…

I need…

I can’t…

## BAD STUDENT

```
3-6 players.
In a parallel universe, after middle school half the students must be kicked out of school. You are teachers (choose your subjects) and must decide the fate of a group of students. Theoretically only grades and behavior matter, but your decisions cannot be questioned, therefore you are free to consider any factor (family, friends, medical conditions, wealth, racism, sexism, politics...)
- One teacher (the Leader) introduces a student: name, gender, appearance, geographical origin.
- Every teacher narrates 2 flashbacks, showing a good reason to make the student pass and a good reason to make her fail. Start narrating with “I remember…”, stick to your personal viewpoint and don’t contradict what has already been established.
- Discuss for exactly 5 minutes.
- Vote either Fail (raise your hand and say “Bad student”) or Pass (do nothing). The majority wins. On a tie, the Leader’s vote wins.
- The Leader narrates a flashforward telling the student’s future.
- Change the Leader and repeat for the next student, until all players have been Leaders.
Lastly, if less than half the students are kicked out, one teacher must be fired. Vote by pointing a finger and saying “Bad teacher”. Break the ties by voting again.

## Let's Eat Kevin!

```
All players write down one real or imaginary creature that eats people onto a scrap of paper.
Put all scraps into a hat including one that says “Kevin”.
Each player draws a scrap from the hat and announces who or what they are.

To Play: 
Those who are not Kevin must discuss the following topics and reach a group decision on each - in any order.
 
Where and when will you eat Kevin?
How will you prepare Kevin?
How will you divvy up Kevin?
In what order will you eat Kevin?
 
Here are the rules:
The decisions MUST be completely unanimous before you can move on.
Your decisions must reflect the creature or thing that you are.
Compromises and deals can be made.
If any additional questions arise they MUST be answered.
If Kevin brings up any point that is even remotely reasonable - it MUST be considered or answered.
 
Kevin! You desperately hope they will change their mind (they won’t). You must stall them. You must bring up reasonable points. If someone is a shark and they’re not discussing eating underwater, you must bring that up. If the group cannot agree within an hour, you escape!

## Incandescent Wars

```
In the beginning there was only Light, and then with a sudden implosion, Darkness grew and spread, leaving only pinpricks of Light to defend itself. In order to defend itself, the Light found a way to create Life.

You are an Incarnation of Life, the first made, in one of its most glorious myriad of forms. Your job is to stand against the forces of Darkness, so that life may flourish.

To do this, you have been given the ability to shift your form as you wish to be able to counter whatever it is the Darkness sends against you.
 
The System:
This is a pure battle of wits, where the players decide on what the limitations are to the battle, to what will be the end, and then determine who goes first.

The first one chooses a form, and then gets to attack. Unless you are able to come up with a counter to that form, you will take damage.

Damage is dealt in the form of the victor choosing if they want start or respond in the next round.
Once damage is dealt, forms reset and combat starts anew.   

```

## Strange Room

```
Everyone makes a character consisting of a name, a profession, a talent (physique, intelligence, social skill), and a reason they want to live.

Each of you wake up alone in a strange room. You have no idea how you got there.

The first player (determined randomly) describes what they see and what they do. Any other player may say, "perhaps it's different" in response to what they see, or "that may not work" in response to an action.

With the former, the objector proceeds to say how it's different, and either the first player agrees or everyone has a secret vote to decide.

With "that may not work", everyone rolls a die. The player with the character gets an additional die for each of their relevant aspects. Whoever gets the high die gets to say what happens. If the character fails, their despair goes up by one; if they succeed, their hope goes up by one.

Once a roll has been adjudicated, move on to a new scene with the player to the left.

If anyone's hope reaches 4, they describe how they get home; if their despair reaches 4, they describe how they get forever trapped.

## The Village

```
The elder ones in the village say the fog has always been there. And it is to be avoided. Everybody knows it’s not a regular fog. It never has been. It appears in bright sunlight, it started creeping out of the forest and it fools your senses. Over time it came closer to the village.

Only a few in the village have actually been in the fog by accident but they spoke of strange noises, a feeling of being watched and a desire to go in deeper, to find out what’s going on. Sometimes these stories are told at the campfire, choking the spirit of the community. 

One day someone new came to the village and rumor had it that he or she came out of the fog. Something about the being felt wrong. Both alien and familiar at the same time. It looked human but clearly wasn’t. But the strangest part was what words he or she uttered at the border of the village. 

Before walking into the fog, the being said: ’We don’t want you any harm. We want to help you. You can feast on our souls.’ Then it disappeared.

## Sympathetic

```
SYMPATHETIC
===========
By Ray Otus

Find, make, or draw a crude doll. Pass it from player to player to show whose turn it is. 

Crime
----------
Everyone plays a character who wants vengeance. On their first turn, each player states a fact about the person the doll represents and something that person did to deserve punishment. Make it colorful! It might be something someone has done to the player in real life, but they shouldn't declare that openly. Stay "in character."

Punishment
----------
After everyone has added at least one detail and crime and YOU feel there is enough to go on with, ON YOUR TURN say instead something horrific you do to the doll. Make it wicked! Then pass the doll to the next player, who will describe what happens to the target in real life. Make it horrible! Afterward the same player says what wicked thing they do to the doll and pass it. 

Regret?
----------
Once everyone has described a punishment and YOU feel sick or embarrassed, ON YOUR TURN say instead some form of "I'm sorry" and pass the doll. Everyone gets a chance to then say "I'm sorry" or "I'm not!"

Hug it out.

## Across the Table (2-Player)

```
You and a friend are in charge of opposing companies hoping to come to a mutual deal. Dig through your wallet and each use a random business card; these will be the companies you are each in charge of. Using a full deck of cards (minus jokers), deal out two cards face down to each player. Players will play a game of Texas Hold’em Poker where each card on the table represents an issue between the companies.
Suite - Issue
Hearts – Social
Diamonds – Financial
Clubs – Ethical
Spades - Personal
The goal is to make sure your company comes out on top of this deal. Players take turns making up issues between the two companies that they need to reach across the table to resolve. During the games, players can make deals, contracts, etc. If both players agree, each player can discard a card from their hand (face down) and draw a new one. The first three issue will appear on the table after players have introduced themselves and made small talk. The next two issues will appear only once a deal has been decided on for the previous one.

## The Haints' House

```
You are a Haint, a thing that goes bump in the night. You live in a military fort, or an old home, or an abandoned prison. Your job is to keep the humans out -- but you have to deal with all the other Haints bumping around as well.

Materials:

At least 1 GM
At least 2 players
1d6 per player
Pencils
Notecards

Write down the following: your Name, your Type (ghost, ghoul, nightmare, etc.), your Appearance, your Dread Power (possession, turn invisible, etc.), and a number between 2 and 5. If your number is closer to 6, you are more Friendly. If your number is closer to 1, you are more Spooky.

Each player also contributes one fact about the home.

When you do something Spooky -- intimidation, aggression, haunting, etc. -- try to roll over your number.

When you do something Friendly -- diplomacy, compassion, healing, etc. -- try to roll under your number.

If you roll an even number, you get an “and”. Describe what happens in addition to your roll, whether it’s a success or failure.

If you roll an odd number, you get a “but”. Describe what happens in spite of your roll whether it’s a success or a failure.

## Under The Mountain

```
Long ago catastrophe beset the great mountain hall of the Dwarves. It was ravaged and overrun, but several brave souls managed to escape, rescuing one of Dwarfkind’s prized relics. This is their story.


Pile some coins on the table.


Name your Dwarf and describe them, especially their beard (Dwarf women have beards too).


Everyone begins with two coins and three items:
* Armor
* Book
* Cask
* Gemstones
* Holy symbol
* Instrument
* Jewelry
* Lantern
* Map
* Mirror
* Mushrooms
* Pipe
* Quill & ink
* Tools
* Weapon


Your group possesses one relic:
* Ancient tome
* Runestone
* Hero’s banner
* Mountain’s Heart
* Sealed orders


Have someone begin by describing where they were when everything went wrong. Everyone then takes turns adding to the story from their dwarf’s perspective.


When facing trouble either succumb to it or flip a coin:
* Heads: overcome with style and skill.
* Tails: overcome with difficulty and pain.


Discard a coin:
* Begin a new scene on your turn.
or
* Re-flip a coin.
Give a coin:
* Interject and add trouble for another dwarf.
Gain a coin: 
* Play a supporting character (not your dwarf) in another’s scene.
or
* Succumb to trouble.
Free:
* Join another’s scene on your turn.
* Ask leading questions.


The game ends when you all escape the mountain.

## Gladiators

```
Players are Gladiators and fight each other to the “death”. One player is Cesar(GM), does not fight and gives thumbs up or down.

What you need to play:
5 dice* for each player. 1 Hat.

How to Play:
The setup:
Throw one die each to determine HP**, weapon and shield value. Use Dice as Token.
Cesar draws fight pairings from the hat***.

In the fight:
Each contestant throws two dice, then chooses one to add to his weapon value. the other goes to the shield value. The player loses 1 HP if the combined shield value is lower than the other players combined attack value. The fight ends after one player has lost 3 or his last HP. After losing 3 HP Cesar gives Thumbs up or down, if down you are dead. Should both players lose their 3rd HP in the same round, it’s a draw and bothe live. Victorious players can choose to loot their opponent but can only hold one weapon and shield each. Lost HP do not generate. Repete fighting until only 1 player is Left.

Have Fun

*Dice do not have to be six sided or identical. **Hitpoint ***Or just makes pairings up.
```
<hr> 

## HIRELINGS

```
Players are lords exploring dungeons with the aid of their hirelings.
Players start with 50 treasure(t) to spend:
Hireling-2t (choose class)
Equipment-1t 
Supplies-1t 

Hirelings start at d4. Each equipment increases the die by one. d4>d6>d8>d10>d12

Hirelings can perform manual labor and class skills.

Fighters can fight monsters. Each success kills one monster.
Magic-users cast spells. State the intent of the spell, GM sets difficulty.
Thieves are nimble and can go where others can’t. Thieves can disarm traps, reducing damage by number of successes. 
Clerics heal at camp, each success heals one hireling. They also turn undead, each success turns one.

GM sets the required successes for checks and can cap the number of hirelings that can test. State how many hirelings you’re using. Keep pools separate by class and injury status, then roll through all of them. Each 4+ is a success, uninjured 1s become injured, previously injured 1s die. Meet or exceed the required successes. Other players can contribute hirelings if you ask before testing.

Every 6 tests, camp must be made. Supplies feed 4 hirelings apiece. Unfed, uninjured hirelings become injured. Unfed, injured hirelings die. Supplies and healing may be shared.

```
<hr> 

## Nightblind

```
Night fell many years ago. It is the duty of the blinded to thrive, and thus show the sun that it is not needed. The sun is wicked and jealous, and sends monsters to corrupt and kill.

Everyone has a piece of paper on which they write down two skills that they excel at.

Everyone except for one person must then close their eyes.

This one person is the Sightseer. It is their sacred duty to describe the actions of the world and to roll the die.

When one of the blinded undertakes a risky action, the Sightseer rolls one six sided dice. The action succeeds on 5 or above, and fails otherwise. If the action uses a skill, the target is set at 3 and above. The Sightseer will report only if the action succeeded or failed.

Unfortunately, the Sightseer represents the damned sun, and is prone to lie. If a blinded wishes to challenge the Sightseer, they must first announce it, then they may open their eyes.

If the blinded is correct, their success is assured and they may close their eyes.

If the blinded is incorrect, they must replace the Sightseer in their cursed duty.

## Vestalia: Girls Just Want To Have Fun(ding)

```
This year’s stipend has arrived and every priestess wants to seize funding for their own projects! 
Grab a domino set, shuffle the tiles to form the boneyard.
Each Vestalis picks a number between 0 and 6. 
Title a card "stipend", then draw five checkboxes underneath.
Start each round by giving each Vestalis five tiles. 
Reveal all the doubles (same pips in both halves). 
The winner of the previous round or someone selected by lot picks one of the doubles or searches the boneyard for one.
The Vestalis whose number matches the pips and the one whose double was selected can write a project in an index card.
Clockwise, the Vestalis take turns matching tiles with those of the layout. If unable to do so, she picks tiles from the boneyard or skips her turn. 
If the sum of the pips of the open ends of the layout are multiples of five they can mark those number of points in any project card. If they had to pick from the boneyard, they must mark those in another Vestalis’ project.    
When a project gets 50 points, it is approved. Mark a stipend box. Celebrate. 
Game ends when there is no more stipend.

## High Arcana

```
Take a standard Tarot deck. Separate the high arcana cards (0-21 with specific names like Death) from the four numbered suits. The dungeon master’s deck consists of the high arcana cards. Players choose their class from the suits. Swords- fighter, wands- wizard, coins- thief, and cups- cleric.

Everyone shuffles their cards. The DM draws 7, the players 4. 

The DM groups his cards into 3 “rooms.” He uses their symbolism and imagery to describe the contents of a harrowing dungeon aloud. Each room’s difficulty is the sum of the grouped cards.

The player left of the DM describes what his character does to overcome the first room’s dangers. He places cards face down in front of himself. The sum of these cards should reflect the effort he described, hinting at their value.* The other players do the same in order.

Next, flip the cards. If the total sum of their efforts beats the DM’s, the DM describes the next room. If the players beat 3 consecutive rooms, everyone continues adventuring by shuffling and drawing again. If the players fail, they reveal their remaining cards and whoever has highest remaining sum switches places with the DM.

*Ace = 1 Face Cards = 10

## Znaroks Rocks

```
The players are 1 hockey coach and a number of hockey players. The coach must explain a game plan, but can only use pronouns, relative directions, conjunctions, numbers, prepositions and words based on the following list: Piss,
Fuck, Shit, Cunt, Dick, Ass, Tits, Balls, Imbecile, Bitch, Nincompoop, Sucker, Cock, Bastard and Damn.

“Based on” includes, but is not limited to changing case, number, mood, voice, mode, part of speech, forming compound words, prefixes, suffixes, infixes, interfixes.

As an added layer of challenge, the coach may draw up a game plan beforehand and the players need to reproduce that based on the instructions. 

Localizing the word list is highly encouraged. It's considered an added bonus if the participants know nothing about Hockey.
```
<hr> 

## Evil Goatees

```
There are good and evil dimensions. The joker from a deck of cards represents which dimension you are in. Shuffle the other 52 cards and place them face down.  Each player draws one card from the top of the deck and places it face up in front of them to represent how evil their goatee is.  If an ace is drawn, reshuffle and draw another card. A higher card represents a more evil goatee.

Start in the good dimension. Whenever a player attempts a difficult action, they draw the top card from the deck. The more evil their goatee, the harder the action is, so the drawn card must be greater than or equal to the player’s goatee to succeed.  An ace is a critical success, but all players are warped into the opposite dimension. The joker is flipped to show this.  When in the evil dimension, an evil goatee becomes an asset, and cards LOWER than or equal to a player’s goatee represent success. When you run out of cards, shuffle all cards, including goatee cards, back together. All players draw new goatees, then continue.

Roleplay as good or as evil as your goatee suggests!

## Our Precious Ghost

```
Your team just completed a mission but the heart of the team, the best of you… they didn’t make it back. This is the story of what happened, and why it matters so much.

Take turns filling in the blanks, clockwise around the table: “We got into _____ (a location) easily enough. We didn’t know ______ (the enemy) were waiting for us. We thought we had _______ (an objective) in the bag. But then, _____ (a person) showed up, and we knew. Things were about to turn bad.”

Continuing around the table clockwise you’ll describe each scene. The first scene is the team arriving at the location. If a character attempts something easy, they succeed. If they attempt something difficult, they fail, unless the player chooses to describe a scene in which they shared something, learned something, or received something from their soon to be dead comrade. The only action you cannot succeed on is saving them.

When they die, end the story. Have each player read the following sentence aloud, filling in the blank. “I’ll miss (pronoun) because ________.”

After everyone has gone, say the following. “____ was the best of us. And we’ll never get (pronoun) back.”

## Little Magic Shop

```
You just opened a magic item shop and got your first set of items from the Artificer’s Guild. Unfortunately, you're new so they unloaded all their weird experiments on you. Let’s see what they brought!

Best with 6 people.

Select a first player, this is the Shopkeeper. The other players are the members of the Artificer’s Guild who just delivered... something. Each Artificer gets to say one word about the object.

The Artificer to the Shopkeeper's left says what the object is: weapon, armor, accessory, or item.

The next Artificer says what the object is made of.

The other Artificers each say one adjective about the object. Anything goes!

The Shopkeeper then comes up with a description for the object. This should include its name, what it does, and how they will sell it.

The Artificer to the Shopkeeper's left then becomes the new Shopkeeper, and this repeats so all players become the Shopkeeper. Players then can vote for their favorite item. Players can't vote for the item from when they were Shopkeeper. Or you can simply enjoy the wacky items you came up with!

These items make great additions to a normal RPG game.

## Love is Pain, Dearest

```
You will need: a coin, clear glasses of water for each player, red, yellow and blue food coloring in a bag. 

Each player gives three details of the setting: Two tragic, one positive. 

Draw a dye from the bag. Choose an archetype and replace the dye. If player's draw the same color use an unselected option. Create a character based on this archetype.

Red = The Hero, The Everyman, The Caregiver
Blue = The Ruler, The Magician, The Explorer
Yellow = The Outlaw, The Innocent, The Jester

Look left. You love this character. Why?
Look right. You hate this character. Why?

The player with the most recent breakup goes first. Who is your scene partner? Flip a coin. 
Heads = Character you love 
Tails = Character you hate. 

Draw a dye. Put one drop into your scene partner’s water, then replace it in the bag. The color is your scene prompt.  Mutually initiate the scene. After the scene, pass the bag clockwise.

Red: Passion
Orange: Betrayal
Yellow: Meeting
Green: Misfortune
Blue: Argument
Purple: Heartbreak
Brown: Violence 
Black: The End

When a player’s water turns Black the game ends. Have each character end their story based on their current color.

## No... your friends

```
While with friends, get a pen and write these down in a piece of paper:
Always lie (unless asked a question identifying you correctly)
Always tell the truth
Always talk about the person on your right
Always change the topic when someone drinks or eats something
Always yawn while someone is talking
Always shift the conversation back to you
Never look at the person talking to you
Always sip your drink the moment someone talks to you
Always talk about a recent show you’ve seen
Fold the tissues individually so what is written cannot be seen. 
If there are more people than the list, add more blank paper and fold them.
If there are less, randomly remove until there is enough for the group less one. Then add one blank folded empty one.
The game starts once everyone has a paper and knows their role. The persons with the blank sheets must try to identify what the others had on their sheets. 

You can come up with new options if you want. You can even have adult options if your group is comfy with that. 

 There are no losers here. The fact you are among friends means you’re all winners.

## Spin the Bottle

```
Welcome to senior year!
School supplies:
* 4 or more people
* Paper
* Pencils (No. 2 preferred)
* A bottle
Sit in a circle with the bottle in the middle.
Populate your school: Nikki the queen bee. Jake the delinquent stoner. Embrace clichés! Write your character at the top of your paper, then write everyone else’s names below. As a group, list the scenes you want to see: the big game, drama club auditions, the mall after school. Everyone should contribute.
Spin the bottle: whoever it lands on picks a scene, sets it, and crosses it out. Anyone who wants to be there can, and the scene lasts as long as it should. After, everyone there writes down who’s a FRIEND, FOE, or CRUSH. Everyone on your sheet can only have one label, but it can change. Keep it secret and spin again. When the scene list is exhausted, the year ends at prom/graduation/whatever.
Report Card: For everyone who has you as a FRIEND, add one - for every FOE, subtract. If a CRUSH you have is mutual, add 2. If not, subtract 1. Before the credits roll, give a freeze frame voiceover saying what happened after graduation: highest score last.

## Truth, Lies and Bullets

```
Truth, Lies and Bullets
A dramatic game of tension and secrets.

The game is played by telling each other lies and truths and requires two six-sided dice.  Roll a d6, and whomever has the lowest score must go first.  On a tie, reroll the tied dice until one person has a lower result than the other.

On your turn you must make a statement about yourself.  Then roll a d6.  

The person on your right must then guess if your statement is a truth or a lie.  If they guess correctly, you must spin the cylinder and pull the trigger (by rolling another 1d6).  If the dice are the same, you blow your brains out and are out of the game.

If they guess wrong, you do not pull the trigger, and instead pass the gun (dice) to the player on your right and the truths, lies and bullets continue.  The “winner” is the last person standing.

## Nathan

```
Four friends arrive at a cabin. A hunting knife hangs from the door with a note and a name written in blood. 

“Nathan.” 

Someone plays Nathan; all others are friends.

Each friend offers a theory for the note. Write each theory on an index card; one card has already been marked “TRUE” on the back. All Nathan's friends will know the truth. 

Turn over a 3-minute hourglass. Everyone will describe their character as the killer picks them off one-by-one. Before the sand runs out, a player must reveal a scary moment and choose a playing card. 

Black = false alarm 
Red = danger! 

When a friend receives their third red card, they die. Dead friends can now play the killer and place red cards on characters. 

Start the next player's turn by flipping the hourglass as is. 

When only Nathan remains, every black card becomes a wound to the killer. When the killer receives 3 black cards, the killer is dead. Nathan dies when he receives his fifth red card. 

If any player fails to complete their description before the hourglass runs out, their character is instantly killed and the hourglass restarts at full.

## Hero Monsters

```
Monster Master:

The monster master is suppose to narrate around each monster he draws from a the stack of monster cards.

Hero Cards:

At the start of the rotation, shuffle the deck of heroes and draw a card. The other players should do the same.

Heroes and Monsters:

Monsters and Heroes both have the following stats:

Attack / Defense / Health Points

To defeat someone:

Throw a d20, if the number is bigger than the defence then the attack is landed. 20, is a critical hit, which means x2 of your total dices.

Horde Cards:

Such cards instruct the MM to draw cards equal to the given number, the heroes must defeat all monsters in order to continue.

Treasure Cards:

At the conclusion of a battle draw one treasure card each.


Finish Game:

It is possible for the MM to draw a boss monster card, defeat the monster to conclude the story and proceed to rotation of the MM role.

## Meltdown - Your Last Battle

```
You finally have the Power, but will you achieve your goal before you meltdown?

Whether it’s to finally defeat the bad guy or rush to turn your group paper in on time, as a group, pick a goal.

Describe your character concept.

Between mental and physical, decide dominant trait. Roll d6 for dominant related obstacles and d4 for non-dominant.

Describe your two trademark skills. Related tests receive a +1.

To Play

GameMaster describes an obstacle. Player states intention on how to overcome the obstacle. GM sets a logical obstacle difficulty between 3 and 9. Roll the die at or above the difficulty to succeed.

To upgrade die, stick a 30mL syringe into your cup of water. Block vision and draw the syringe. At 0-9mLs no change, 10-19mL upgrade one die size, 20-20ml upgrade two die sizes, 30ml upgrade three die sizes. Die sizes are d4, d6, d8, d10, d12. Remove drawn water from play. Remove an ice cube to reroll. 

If you succeed by more than 4, remove an ice cube. You used too much Power. It weakens you. 

When all your ice cubes are melted or removed, you are defeated.

The GM sets the scene and everybody discusses possible actions. Each round, one or more players describe and take actions.

The GM assigns each action a difficulty from 3 to 6 and chooses its alignment:

                - Recklessness   |   + Recklessness
                                 |
     + Valour        Victor      |        Hero
   ------------------------------o-------------------
     - Valour       Survivor     |       Victim
                                 |

Your alignment (if any) is determined by your Recklessness and Valour points, which start at zero.

Modify the action’s difficulty:
  Same alignment as you: -1
  Opposite alignment: +1
  Essence helps: -1
  Essence hinders: +1

Success is D8 >= difficulty.

Adjust your Recklessness and Valour by +1 or -1, according to your action’s alignment.
Gain a Lost token if your Recklessness increased.
Gain a Victory token if your Valour increased and your action succeeded.
Gain a Lost token if you rolled a 1.

The GM describes the outcome of each action, then introduces the next round.

If you have at least 3 Lost tokens, you die next action.

The game ends if:
  The party (including dead players) has at least [2 * party size] Victory tokens
  Everyone is dead
  All hope is lost

## Lighthearted Friend

```
To be played after my other entry, “Jack the Ripper.”

History tells us that Charles Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll) could not have been the Whitechapel killer, because he was enjoying a summer in the country with child actress Isa Bowman at the same time as many of the murders occurred.

One player is CHARLES.
One player is ISA.
One player is ID. 

ID finds a nasty piece of erotica on the internet and picks the most graphic paragraph. (Do NOT show it to ISA!) CHARLES must rearrange the letters in the paragraph to form a brief, clean, entertaining children’s story. CHARLES must use every letter in the paragraph, and cannot use a letter more times than it appears in the original.

CHARLES reads the story he wrote to ISA. ISA must try to guess a sex act that occurred in the original paragraph. If ISA is wrong, everyone switches roles and the game starts over. If ISA guesses correctly, the game must end immediately!

## Vigilantics

```
Need:
1 GM and 2+ Players
Paper and Pencils
1 d6

Every player creates a "superhero" with a gimmicky "superpower" and a choice of three gadgets. These “heroes” have no superhuman abilities.
ex.) Danger Dad: World’s greatest dad, world’s greatest employee, and world's worst superhero.
Power: Gut Busting Dad Joke
Gadgets: Trusty Toolkit, Dad-Mobile (family van), and Cargo Shorts of Carrying

The hero abilities are Speed, Might, and Brains.
All abilities have one point by default, but players may distribute four more between them.


When rolling the d6 for an ability, you must roll below your ability score.
Gadgets can only be used once, but powers can be used infinitely.
Powers and gadgets always succeed, but may vary in effectiveness.
On all rolls, a one is a perfect success, and the closer to six, the worse the effectiveness of your action, even for successes.

"Crash!" "Bang!" "Pow!" Our unlikely heroes appear on the scene to stop our villain. Only one of these heroes can reach the newspaper headlines, so whoever can capture the villain and hand him to the authorities first wins, but if they don't act soon, our villain’s plans will begin, causing everyone to lose.

## Memories

```
You are elderly people in a Nursing home. No one comes to see you anymore. You want to talk with others, tell them about your life, your dreams, and your memories.

Sit around a table. Get nine matches and an ashtray. Cut a paper sheet in nine pieces and write a word in each piece. These words are your conversation topics.

CHILD  LOVE  SPOUSE  WORK  FRIEND  GAME  TRAVEL  GRANDCHILD  HOME

One of you take a piece of paper and begins to talk about the topic in it. While speaking he lights a match and set fire to the paper in the ashtray. All of you talk about the proposed topic until the paper is consumed. Then a new elder takes another piece of paper and proceeds in the same way, but all of you have forgotten your memories related to the previous topic. You cannot use them in the new conversation. If the memories are necessary (for example, you must have CHILD in order to have GRANDCHILD), you must justify it in another way.

Finish when the nine pieces of paper have been burned —and, with them, all your memories.

```
<hr> 

## Opposystem

```
The storyteller describes the setting, and how the group of characters fit within the setting, then players create their characters.

Each character has attributes and skills. The storyteller guides, and must agree to, all attributes and skills.
Players may choose any attribute, but only if they can convince another player to take its opposite. For example, if one player wants to be strong, they must convince another player to be weak. Each attribute may only be used once in the group.
Each player also chooses 3 to 5 skills. These may be narrow or broad, provided there is no overlap between the skills of any characters in the group. For example, if one character is skilled in “combat”, no other character may be. However, if one character is skilled in “melee”, another may be skilled in “archery”.

When a challenge or conflict occurs in the game, the storyteller determines the difficulty, from 1 to 5, and decides if the character’s attributes and skills help, hinder, or do not affect the challenge. The player rolls 3 dice. If hindered, the lowest die is used, if helped, the highest die, otherwise the middle die. If it exceeds the difficulty, the character succeeds.

## Spiral

```
Spiral

Draw a spiral.  The larger the spiral,  the longer the game. 

Create a conspiracy. Bring it to life. 

Show your friends the spiral. 

What is the mystery behind the spiral? Investigate the conspiracy. 

Mark the start of the spiral. How deep does it go? 



Rules 

Trying something relatively simple? Narrate it. 

Trying something difficult or dangerous? Roll a d6. The result of the die is a degree of success or failure, and a measurement of how many centimeters the marker moves towards the center of the spiral… and the conclusion of the investigation. 

As the marker moves towards the center of the spiral,  the mystery becomes clearer; the investigators bolder and more capable. However,  things also become more dangerous,  surreal, and horrific, slowly escalating as the investigation twists and turns. 

Investigators narrate their actions and roll dice, the spiral maker narrates the results based on the investigators’ die rolls (and the overall investigation)

Die results

1 = catastrophic failure. 

2 = moderate failure.  

3 = minor setback.

4 = harrowing success.

5 = moderate success.

6 = critical success.

Once the marker passes the spiral’s halfway mark,  investigators roll 2d6, choosing the higher result. During the final few turns of the spiral, investigators roll 3d6.

## King's Dice

```
King’s Dice is a simulated gambling game.

Set-up:
Each Player needs twenty six-sided (d6) dice.
There is one communal twenty-sided (d20) King’s die.

Game-play:
Players roll the d20. Highest roller starts with the d20. The d20 is rolled. All players starting with the d20 roller say how many d6 they will roll. Each player rolls the dice specified. Sum each player’s dice. Player closest to the d20 result wins all the d6 rolled. Winner then rolls the d20 for the next round.

In the event of a tie, tied players take one additional d6 and decide whether the die will add or subtract from their total. Players roll the dice and adjust their totals. Continue until there is no tie or someone is out of dice. If a player runs out of dice during a tie-breaker, they roll no more dice that turn. Should a player’s sum equal the d20 result, before ties, and is the only player to do so, that player wins the round plus one additional die from each player. The game ends a player has no dice at the end of a round. The player with the most d6s at the end of the game wins.

## A Fistful of Dust

```
Law forgot this place when the glimmer-mines ran dry. The unquiet-dead haunt the mountains now. Ghost-Towns. There are bandits too, deserters from the civil-wars back East. I guess they used to call you a Knight. You also used to be dead. Now you’re just drifting.

What’s your name?
What marks you as Undead?

Rank, from 1-4: 
Gun-Slinging
Sleight-of-hand
Fast-Talking
Laying-low

Throw that many coins in a conflict. 
Throw an extra coin if you have an advantage.

If you throw all Heads, throw another coin. Keep on like this until you throw a Tails, or get 4 Heads. 

4 Heads is a flawless success. 0 Heads is complete, utter failure. In between lie part-successes, difficult choices, hard bargains.

You can re-throw by ticking off one of the following, and saying how it helps:

-Concealed Artefact
-Unwitting Accomplice
-Wytchery
-The Landscape
-Flashback

When you tick the last option, the scene ends with your death (again).

Choose 1 of the following Wytcheries that you can use whenever. Fill in the blanks.

-I can see the [______] in every [______].
-I can change [______] to [______], and back.
-I can produce a [______] from thin air. 
-I always know [______].
-My dreams say [______].

## Manic pixie dream girl

```

Need: 1D6, tokens 
Two players: Girlfriend, Boyfriend
Boyfriend reads everything before asterisks aloud

Girlfriend. Choose 3+ quirky behaviours you’re into and your appearance. (e.g. hair bows, making up songs, knitting). For each detail add a token to your pool. 

Your boyfriend is troubled; you need to come up with neat ideas for things to do together. Stay in character throughout the game. 

Describe an idea for a fun thing to do together, roll a D6. If he’s delighted: Roleplay that date and share something real about yourself or your feelings. 

Otherwise pay a token to Boyfriend; remove that behaviour or look.

Describe a new date-idea. Roll again.

If you receive a token back you can reinstate a detail or invent something new. 

******* 

Boyfriend. You are reliant on girlfriend for your happiness.

If she’s not sufficiently delightful you become withdrawn, sullen, frustrated. Resist her attempts to engage you unless she rolls 6, then be cheerful and affectionate for a brief time.  

If you don’t like an emotion or truth she shares, take one of her tokens. 

You can give a token back if she delights you.
 
When girlfriend has no tokens left, break up with her.

## On the seventh day Gods had finished...

```
You all are Gods. Choose your domain, describe your character and favorite depiction.
You all barely defeated Titans, but they’ll be back. You gather to create a world to
determine who most powerful one – he will lead you in the next battle against Titans. Describe how your new world looks like so far.

You think that God on your left will deal with Titans better. He is now your Oracle.

During your turn:

Give the world something empowering our domain, then modify the previous thing created, so it will compliment either your, or your Oracle’s domain;

or tell a myth that will strengthen your Oracle’s position as a leader, or mock other God. After a myth is told every God can choose a new Oracle for himself.

Now it’s the player on your lefts’ turn.

Whenever something builds up your domain’s strength, give yourself a point.

Each day begins on a random God, as he adds something to the developing world. The day ends on the same God, as he modifies most recent creation.

After six days the world is complete. Titans come back, prepared to fight. God(s) with most points determine the outcome of the confrontation.

## Ghosts & Flowers

```
City burning and smoking ruins. Wandering ghosts.
You: alone. You’re running at night in the streets of the city looking for a flower. 
What flower, why and what for ?

Discard the faces from a 52 cards deck. Shuffle the 40 remaining cards.
Each turn, draw a card. 
Red is neutral or good, you keep the card. Black means a conflict. 
Use “Meaning of cards” for inspiration and tell what is happening.

When a conflict:
discard 2 cards and you win
OR
draw a card. If the value is lower than the conflict’s card, you succeed. If not, things go wrong:  you must discard 2 cards.
Cards used during a conflict are discarded.

Winning: If you get 10 red cards before drawing the last card from the deck, you find the flower. If not, you epically fail!


Meaning of cards (when several words, choose one) 

1 Stray dogs / cats / wolves / crows
2 Somebody needs help
3 Undead / spirit of the forest
4 Gang of bikers / vagabonds / slaves
5 A demon with an animal look
6 Ghost hunters 
7 Flesh-eating insects / rats / bats
8 Ghosts searching for souls
9 Witches / cultists / priests 
10 An old enemy

## Songs for empty apartments

```
Your love is gone.
You're alone in your apartment.
You're alone with the songs of your love story.
You're going to reconstruct it.

You need three friends and your smartphones.

Before play, each of you chooses a song.

The one who lost their love more recently is the Voice. Going in clockwise direction, the others will take respectively the roles of Drums, Bass and Guitar.

1. Drum, play your song and ask a question about how it became meaningful for the relationship. It can range from a simple “Why this one?” up to a very loaded and targeted question. Set a scene framed around that memory.
2. Bass, take the question from the Drums and start asking the Voice about it, using questions about whens, wheres, whys, hows and such.
3. Voice, play the protagonist, answering the Bass’s questions. Bass and Voice, keep conversing in a Q&A fashion.
4. Guitar, stop the Bass and the Voice at a climactic moment, then answer the questions from the lost love’s point of view. What you say cannot be questioned by the Bass.

After a scene, roles shift clockwise.
Repeat three more times.

## What Could Go Wrong?

```
A Game of Heists and Hilarious Consequences

YOU NEED:
3-6 players, no GM
A die with the same number of faces as the number of players

MECHANIC:
When a player-character takes an action, they declare what they hope the result will be and assign it to the highest face on the die. 

(Player A says, “I detonate the explosives. On a 4, the bank vault door blows open.”)

Then they say, “What could go wrong?” and pass the die around the table. For each other face of the die, another player describes a different result. Each must be WORSE than the one before it.

(Player B says, “On a 3, the explosives don’t go off.” Player C says, “On a 2, they go off and trigger the sprinkler system.” Player D says, “On a 1, they go off and set all the money on fire.”)

Then the acting player rolls and discovers the true consequences of their action.

Before you play, you can use the same mechanic to define the elements of the heist, such as Target, Location, Attack Plan, and Getaway Plan. Each player suggests an idea for each element, and one player rolls to determine which to use.
```
<hr> 

## HEIST!

```
Form a crew. Pull a heist. Get away with it.

Each player draws a card from a deck to determine play order. Highest card wins - weight goes spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs. No jokers.

First player is pointperson. They know the job: naming the loot, who wants it, and where it is. They then describe the first impossible obstacle.

Second player explains who they are, and how they can overcome that obstacle. Then, they describe the next impossible obstacle.

Play proceeds with each player explaining who they are, how they can overcome the last obstacle, and naming the next obstacle.

Pointperson needs to overcome the final impossible obstacle.

Once the crew is assembled, the second player draws two cards to start the heist, revealing one. If black, their job goes smoothly. If red, there’s a complication. They describe it, and explain how they overcome it.

Each player then pulls two cards, in turn, and reveals one, as above. Pointperson goes last.

More than half the job is black? Success! Payday! Infamy!


More than half the job is red? Failure! Everyone reveals their second card to see if they escape. If red, describe how you’re caught. If black, describe your daring escape.

## Chromed poets

```
There is a war in space. Big robots piloted by humans fight each other with laser swords and beam cannons. The war has been going on for a long time but it is about to end. It ends today, with this battle.

You are the two best pilots of your factions and fight each other one last time, deciding everyone’s fate.

You compose haikus using at least one of the words listed below in each.The fastest pilot to compose the first haiku starts.

The pilots then alternate at composing haikus. The haikus should answer to each other and are about who you are, what you pilot, why you fight, what is this war about, your relationship with each other and scenes from your battle.

The first pilot to use all the words below in their haikus, wins the war. Their last haiku must describe the consequences for their faction. The other pilot gets then to write a final haiku with any word to describe the consequences for everyone else.

Metal - sword - sunrise - rose - planet - space - nuclear - explosion - dust - particle - chrome - ring - divine - rebel - fire - attack - transform - colony - door - peace - stardust - comrade - human - exploration - star - alien - terror - field - god - fly

AUDIENCE:

[No character speaks--make noises.

You’ll make ridiculously overwrought grimdark-ass gifts for the Empress, enhancing Her GRANDEUR, HORROR, and ALLURE.

Artificer-supplicants, simultaneously: prostrate yourselves. Gather tokens; raise this offering in your trembling hand. 

Players: each describe your offering: weapon, art-object, piece of yourself? (Yes.)

Empress: Take. Everything. Describe your treatment of the one artifact that best pleases you. Stroke its maker’s head.

Hurl tokens into the bag.]

Next: Embodiment of the Empress passes left. Another AUDIENCE. 

When you’ve nothing left to give: At last! FEED YOURSELF TO THE EMPRESS. How does this change Her? 

Play until only the Empress remains.

## Competitive Reality Television

```
Setup:

Players select an appropriate reality show trope contestant, an auxiliary skillset, and two 6-sided dice (2d6).
 
The Reality Show Host/Producer (GM) chooses and explains the contest rules and challenge theme. This game supports any competitive reality show. Each episode (game session) is broken down into challenges, workroom, confessionals, and eliminations.

Gameplay:

CHALLENGE MECHANIC: Players explain their actions, roll 2d6 plus any drama dice (d4) and compare totals.

Each episode is a play session containing:

The mini-challenge – Players CHALLENGE; scores resulting over 8 or under 6 earn a d4 drama die.

Workroom - Players describe their intended submission for the contest and earn a drama die.

Confessionals – Player SPOTLIGHT;  Players talk about other contestants or their submission. GM modifies the discussed Player’s drama dice pool, adding d4 for HYPE or removing d4 for SHADE. Players may instead talk about THEIR auxiliary skillset allowing the GM to modify their drama pool as above.

Elimination Challenge – Players CHALLENGE; Highest total wins the episode and earns a d4 for the next episode, lowest is eliminated from the competition.

GM may add challenges to an episode by repeating any steps above. There MUST BE a confessional step preceding a challenge.

## The Empire won the war, but the people lost

```
The empire of Aradia just won a war, but its people lost. Refugee Foxen, Leos, Corvids, and Humans have flooded the capital city of Adrannar. Living in squalid conditions, some have turned to crime to survive. Some have left the city in search of adventure. Some are talking of revolution.

The Emperor Odar appears unconcerned about the conditions of his people. General Deadra believes the army should be used to quell the unrest. Chancellor Yepreffen argues in court for negotiation and social projects, but privately funds many of the revolutionary groups in hopes of elevating himself to Emperor.

Outside the city, a wartorn landscape is full of destroyed keeps, ancient ruins, and local warlords keeping just small enough to avoid the attention of the Empire. Fierce beasts, bloated on the meat of corpses, are in search of more prey. Life outside is quite dangerous.

To Play

Describe your character. Choose three positive and two negative traits. When undertaking an action, roll 1d6 vs GM 1d6 - higher wins. If a positive trait would aid, roll 2d6, take the higher. If a negative trait would hinder, roll 2d6, take the lower. Characters have ten health. Successful attacks remove 1 health.

When you try something risky, describe how, sum 2d6, and add the appropriate Style. Add +1 if one of your Roles applies, or +3 when using your primary's Special.

<= 6: failure. Situation worsens. If your primary Role applies, instead get a complicated and partial success.
7-9: partial or complicated success. The Corporation presents two choices.

## Out of the Dark World

```
You are children, taken to the Dark World and imprisoned by Nightmares. You run through the dark corridors of an empty school to escape your jailer, the Butcher.

Your memories are blurry. You need answers:
1. Where is the heart of the Dark World?
2. Who is ruling now?
3. What happened here?
4. Who are the prisoners?
5. How to go back to the real world?

GM, put 4 six-sided dice on the table.

Players, when you try to:
- run for your life,
- be sneaky,
- be convincing,
- get an answer to the first unanswered question of the list (GM, ask how),
take a die and roll it. (Without die, you fail.)
You succeed on 4+. Otherwise, the GM will say you are now afraid, chased, hurt, trapped or broken. (GM, keep the die.)

If you ever fight, you are hurt, captured or worse.

In a quiet time, one of you can recollect something to put a die back on the table.
(GM, reincorporate it into scary descriptions.)

Locations: Decaying underground forest / Foggy sewer market / Abandoned subway station / Silent troglodytic dwellings
Chasers: Stalking shadows / Spiderhounds / Scalpel Dancer / The Grinning Girl
People: Arachnoids / Leeches / Faceless / Drowned Ones

## Last Cigarette

```
For 2 players, at least one of whom must be a smoker.

One player plays the Condemned, who is given the chance to have one last cigarette before being executed. The other is the Executioner.
The game begins with the lighting of the cigarette(s). It ends when the cigarette is finished, establishing that the characters will never talk again.

Pre-game considerations:
-	What is the period of this scene?
-	Why is the Condemned being executed?
-	What is the previous relationship between these two characters, if any?

Post-game considerations:
-          Did the relationship between these characters change during the scene?
-          Which character held the true power by the scene’s end?
-          What did the characters share?
-          What happens next?

You can choose to exchange the cigarette for another consumable device and/or the characters for other archetypes. Examples:
-	The characters are an Informant and a Handler meeting one last time.
-	Exchange the cigarette for a drink (coffee, beer, milkshake) or a meal
-	The characters are lovers ending the relationship with one last dance (the scene lasts for a song’s length)
-	The characters are Wounded and Another, where the Wounded will die at scene’s end.

## Yammer

```
YammerIsAFastTalkingRPGDesignedToMakeYouThinkOnYourFeetAndKeepSpeaking.

Each player must speak as fast as possible during a conversation encounter.

The GM will score each player’s Yammering out of 10, on 3 criteria: Material, Length, and Speed.

The Material value is how entertaining the player was. Tangents and stories are allowed, as long as they relate to the topic (eventually).

Length is how long the player Yammered.

Speed is how quickly the player Yammered.

Once the GM believes the player has become too incoherent, disinteresting, or hesitating; the next player must begin Yammering.

Subsequent Yammers must avoid repetition and begin where the previous player ended in terms of topic.

After the encounter, the GM will sum of all scores for the players. Scores above 60 should succeed (and some with higher scores), below should cause complications.

A session of Yammer should contain 4 encounters (1 per player).

Example settings and encounters:

* The players are secret agents at a party. They may need to convince guards, extract information from the mastermind, or get the aid of an enemy agent!
* The players are at a dead end job. They may need to Persuade the boss to keep their jobs, or calm an unruly customer.

## A tale untold

```
On a cold and abandoned Earth, we have found a relic from times of Men. Gather around and put it on display for everyone to see!

It could have been a teapot or an old radio. Now it is all dust and rust. And for us, who harvest stories of Men, its tale is still untold.

***

Secretly decide whether you are repulsed or fascinated by the relic.

Whenever you feel brave, take the relic. The others ask you questions. Who had made it? How did it feel? Where have you found it? Answer one that suits you best.

Now, do you see a Scar or a Replacement on the relic? Scar: describe it and ask someone how did it happen. Decide if they lies and why. Replacement: ask someone to describe it. You tell how did it happen. They decides if you lie and why.

Put the relic on display again for someone to take it.

***

When you feel the story is complete, roll d6 + lies. If the result is higher than Scars + Replacements, the tale remains untold. The repulsed win. If the result is lower than Scars, the relic is destroyed and no one wins.

How to play:
The first player (picked at random) describes a horrible death trap. The player on their right is caught in this trap.

The trapped player writes down a phone number of someone they know, but leave one of the digits empty. Roll d10, enter that digit in the empty space. The player dials the number. 

If there is no answer they live for another round. 

If the phone is answered start the timer. The player engages in a conversation, in character, about the death trap. Stop the timer when either person hangs up. 

Consult the chart:

1-10 seconds 
Your character died attempting to escape. Game over. 
11-20 seconds 
Your character suffers major injury.
21-30 seconds 
Your character suffers minor minor. 
31+ seconds 
Your player has escaped the death trap. You learned a valuable life lesson. 

If you get the same result in the chart as a previous result, use the next highest result. 

Play continues to the left. 

There are no winners, only survivors.

## Demon Dare

```
Each player creates a Person and a Demon.

For Persons, decide:
A name;
Your Truth: an unspeakable secret you will never reveal.

Let everything else emerge during play.

Demons drive humans to self-destruction. Choose a Demon’s Name: [attribute] + [title] + of + [purview]. E.g. “Cruel Lady of Tears.”

Frame scenes in turn: focus on a Person and have a Demon dare them to do something destructive. Be inspired by the Demon’s Name.

Person’s player, tell the Demon’s player what could convince you. You cannot refuse in the end.

Draw a poker card:

A-K-Q-J: You get away with it;

10-9-8-7-6: You do it, with cost or complication;

5-4-3-2: You screw up.

Play out the outcome together. You can never reveal your Truth, even if you would like to.

From the second card on, build a house-of-cards. From the third card on, if your house-of-cards falls, your Truth comes to light.

If your Truth comes to light, make a deck with the cards of your crumbled house-of-cards and draw one:

A-K-Q-J: You come clean (what did you learn?) and destroy a Demon.

10-9-8-7-6: Choose:
You come clean;
You get a scar, but destroy a Demon.

5-4-3-2: Your life is forever scarred. How? Why?
```

## Triad - Deckbuilding Game

```
There are 2 decks: Stats deck (Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity cards) and Main (Spells and Equipment cards) deck.
Everyone draws 8 cards at random from the stats deck, and 2 from the Main deck.
Place and flip up 6 cards from the main deck in the center row and begin.

The objective is to use spells/equipment (armor and weapons) to kill your opponents.
Every turn, draw a stat point from the stat deck and 4 cards from your deck.
Discard 3 stat cards to buy any 2 power stat card, which are set aside from the primary stat deck.
Use these cards to buy items and spells in the center row, which go into your discard pile.
At end of turn, all cards played go into the discard pile, and draw a new hand.
When you’re out of cards in your deck, shuffle the discard pile and it becomes your deck again.
This deck essentially defines your “class”

Spells/Equipment have specific costs (ex. Fireball = 2 Int, Bow = 2 Dex, 1 Str)
Spells may be played once per turn for free; Equipment are played and stay out.
Most equipment either have passive buffs or activated abilities, like attacks.
```

## DUELLO - A Game of Magic and Politics

```
Setting: A League of competitive wizard’s duels.

Conflict resolution operates using a timer. Each character must describe what they are doing in response to their opponent, within their timed Round. The opponent will then describe their counter within their Round, continuing until one side cannot respond, and is declared defeated. 

Character Creation:

Begin by choosing two schools:

-Abjuration (Warding, denial, blocking opponents)
-Evocation (Energy/Fire/Explosions)
-Transmutation (Change)
-Necromancy (Death)
-Illusion (Phantasms/ Trickery)

These will flavour your descriptions in battle. Additionally, distribute 4 points between Luck and Ability. Each point in Ability grants you 10 seconds of talking time per Round. Each point of Luck can be expended to grant you a single 20-second extension for one Round per game session. Luck may also be expended in non-combat encounters.

NPC encounters are assigned an Ability score by the Storyteller, and a number of rounds to be endured before the NPC is defeated. 

Example:
Easy (Apprentice, Common Soldier): 2-5 Rounds
Difficult (Archmage, Noble Socialite): 10 Rounds 

NPCs may also have Luck.

Talking/social encounters may occur as combat, but with conversations being limited by time as combat is. Social Rounds are double the length of combat rounds.
```
<hr> 

## Final Testament

```
3-5 players. You play ordinary people, who are friends.

Shuffle a card deck (minus face cards).

LIFE

Character objectives:
*Be open about their life and emotions
*Entangle the characters socially and emotionally
*Reveal tiny unexplained Enigmas in their lives (record these)

Draw a card each. Go in order of face value, lowest first, to:
*Frame a scene where something happens to develop or transform your relationship with another character
*Draw two cards, discard one

DEATH

When your hand hits 13+, die.

Take turns to describe the funeral, a sentence at a time.

POSTMORTEM

The deceased becomes GM.

The GM’s objectives:
*Create a compelling, frightening conspiracy
*Make it threaten the characters
*Weave the Enigmas in

Start the clock at zero. The GM frames scenes and advances the clock if, in a scene:
*The characters work to resolve an Enigma
*The characters show fear 

When the clock reaches 13, the characters secretly choose one of the following:
*Go into hiding forever
*Risk death to crack the conspiracy
*Betray the others

GM: frame a final scene where the conspiracy is fully revealed.

If anyone betrayed, those who risked death are screwed. Describe what happens.

Anyone who survives narrates a short epilogue for themselves.

## You’ve Been Screwed.

```
	You’re not sure How.  You’re not sure Why.  You’re not even completely sure Who.  But you’ve definitely been screwed.
	You wake or land on a new alien world.  It is not what you were promised.  You are all on your own and you’re pretty sure no one is coming to get you.  
Choose or Roll a d12 and Describe.
	               Personnel
1-	Profession.
2-	Why you left earth.
3-	Who you think screwed you over.
4-	Another colonist/castaway you are worried about.
	                Exploring
5-	An interesting geographic feature.
6-	An interesting plant.
7-	Animal sign.
	                 Inventory
8-	Thank god it’s here. What is it? Why is it essential?
9-	It’s missing, we’re doomed!
10-	WTF is this.  Something strange has been packed, describe it as best you can.
	                  Other
11-	Learn more about something already learn/discovered.
12-	Talk is cheap, whiskeys cost money.  Describe what you do to ensure survival, or escape.

	After everyone has had a turn or two or more, take turns guessing where you are and why/how you ended up there.  Build on each other’s theories if they make sense.
	200 Year’s later an exploring team finds your planet.  What do they find?

<hr> 

## The Tribe

```
A game for a GM and 4-6 players who play members of a stone-age tribe, hunting, finding shelter, and fending off attacks from rival tribes. 

All in-character dialogue must be spoken in the tribe's Tongue. Write a syllable on an index card each. All words in the Tongue must be formed from these syllables. 

To define a new word in the Tongue, declare the word in English. Roll. 
1-2: You fail to communicate. Nobody may attempt to define that word again.
3+: Pick a number of the syllables equal to at least its  English syllables to form the new word, and write it on an index card. Everyone can now use it.
5+: Also define a new syllable.

When you attempt something new, e.g. making a spear, or creeping up on a wolf, roll.

1: this action is Taboo. You fail and nobody may attempt it again.
2-5: only you may attempt this action. 
6: all the Tribe may attempt this action.

To attempt a defined action, roll.

1-2: You fail. The GM will describe what complication arises.
3-5: you succeed, but the GM will describe a compilation or hard choice.
6: you succeed.

```

## Homeward Going: A Rlly Wow Travel

```
Your humans accidentally left you when they moved across the big city!  They wouldn’t do it on purpose, you’ve been such a good dog!  You and your friends must travel to find them!

Make a dog!  Describe and name them.  There’s two stats: Good-Dog! and Bad-Dog!  Divide 6 points between them.  All dogs communicate telepathically with each other.

Have a facilitator- they play all the humans, describe the world and set challenges for you dogs.  They always ask “what do you do?”

If an outcome is unclear, roll 2d6.  On a 10+ it happens how you say, on a 7-9 it happens, but there’s a consequence, on a 6- it goes bad or sideways.  Humans are unpredictable!

You can spend points from a relevant stat to increase your outcome, but one stat flips each time.  I spend +2 from good dog to get 10+!  YASS!  But Good-Dog! goes down one and Bad-Dog! goes up one.  Outside world is hard!

If either stat hits 0, you give up.  Too mean or too soft, cya doggie!  If a human calls you a Good-Dog! or a Bad-Dog! increase that stat.  The facilitator will do this on 6- sometimes.

Find your humans!

```
<hr> 

## Fire of the Gods

```
Introduction
Long ago, Divinity left the world; the gods disappeared. But that Fireremained in their bloodlines, and it has been rekindled.
What will you do with the power of a god?
Divinity
The GM frames the world with two simple questions:
When will the game start?
When did Divinity return?
Narrate your god's description and background; all gods are exceptional. Choose a Realm, assign 5 points between Mundane (operating as a mortal) and Divine (operating as a god), minimum 1 point. Also start with 5 Numina (the divine Fire).
Gameplay
Divine always trumps Mundane; chance is only for similar forces. Divinecan be used within a god's Realm, or when Numina is spent. Players roll dice, taking 2d6- one fortune and one fate. Roll, subtracting fate from fortune, adding stat, and optionally Numina.
> 0: Player narrates.
< 0: GM narrates.
= 0: Player narrates, GM narrates price.
Each use of Divine gives the GM Fate, which can be spent anytime to subtract one from a roll, narratively justified. Numina can be used to negate hits, but at 0 Numina, the next hits cause tremendous stress on the god's body; the GM will keep you posted.

```
<hr> 

## Moving On

```
Each PC is a Ghost whose job is to complete their unfinished business and move on. Death (the GM) can only take one of you, so you must advance your goals, while trying to sabotage the others. 

Step One: Pick Your Unfinished Business
1. Comfort a Loved One
2. Revenge of Your Murder
3. Secret that Must Be Told

Step Two: Create World and Objectives
Collaboratively work with Death to create what goals will enable each PC to move on. As you create these goals, build out the world and backstory all of you unhappy haunts will inhabit. 

Step Three: Ghost Moves
As Ghosts, you can only impact the world in three ways: 
- Move small objects 
- Whisper into the wind
- Appear in a reflective surface(s)

Use these moves to either complete your unfinished business or to sabotage your fellow ghosts. 

Step Four: There Can Only Be One
Once a Ghost completes their Goal, the game ends, the cunning Ghost has Moved On.

## WAR and FAITH

```
Empires are built through WAR and FAITH.

Needed for Play:
A “Deity” Character
2+ “Monarch” Characters
Followers (Paper Balls)
2d6
Matches

Monarchs all have unique names for “Deity” and design a prayer for tribute. Monarchs start with 6 paper followers.

Begin PRAYER ROUND: Monarchs perform their prayers and offer tributes to the Deity. During each prayer round, Monarchs vie for the Deity's blessing. Deity decides favorite prayer each round and grants winning monarch a BOON. 

BOON grants monarch one follower and power to roll 2d6.

If 2d6’s roll over follower count, go to WAR:
Roll 1d6. Limited by one match, set fire up to this many of other Monarch’s followers. All collateral damage is fair in WAR.

If 2d6 roll under follower count, build FAITH: 
Roll 1d6. Gain this many FAITHful followers.

If doubles roll, Fate sends PROPHET npc. Reroll 2d6’s:

If less than original roll, CRUSADE: Sacrificially burn no less than half of own followers.

If rolled over/equal to original roll, MISSION: Consume all followers of another Monarchy.

Monarchs are beheaded after losing all followers. 

Behead all other monarchs, burn heretics, gain followers and vie for Deity's love. Last monarch alive is crowned Emperor.

## Carfax Abbey

```
Do you love aristocratic family drama but feel it needs more bloodsuckers? Or do you fancy gothic horror but believe it would be improved with the addition of servants and scandals? Then mash them together in the setting for this gothic aristocratic vampire drama: Carfax Abbey.

Set at Count Dracula’s English residence, the game asks players to imagine Dracula (and associated characters) as part of a family of nobles—or their servants.

Players choose characters from those featured in either Dracula or a beloved period drama. Mix them up! See how Renfield would do as the resident cook, or picture the family matriarch as one of Dracula’s brides.

The GM then presents the players with a situation inspired by both sources. Some stories can come from one source, some from the other, but the really fun ones will likely be a blend. Sure, Dracula knows how to handle a group of hunters arriving to stake him—but what will he do when the chauffeur gets his granddaughter pregnant? How will the butler handle things when visitors from Transylvania show up and turn out to be messy, bloody eaters?

Players then resolve the story with dialogue, drama, scandal, and horror. 


```
<hr> 

## The Trial

```
Someone must have slandered you, for one morning, without having done anything truly wrong, you were arrested.

Select one player to be the Accused. The Accused is not entitled to know their crime and must struggle to preserve their dignity. Remaining players are Accusers who oppose or support the Accused by playing their family and friends, and members of the oppressive court system.

Starting Coins:
Accused- 5*Players
Accuser- 5
Bank- 5

The Bank is hidden to the Accused but accessible to Accusers. Accusers may steal from the Bank. If the Accused correctly announces the theft, they receive the stolen coins. If the accusation is false, the Accused pays one coin to the Bank.

Take turns framing scenes from the Accused's life, beginning with the arrest. If a scene ends favourably for a character, their player may gift the Judge, a non-player entity, up to three coins. If disagreements arise, simultaneously bid coins. Highest wins narrative control, but must yield their bid to the Bank. Losing players may pay their bid to negotiate details of the scene. When all players are without coins, the Trial begins. The player who gifted the most coins to the Judge narrates the Trial's outcome.
```

## Jump!

```
Required: poker deck, d10

Your interdimensional ship is broken and you have no control over your destination. You must fix it with local materials.

Shuffle, lay deck face-down. Take turns clockwise.

On your turn:
Turn over the top card. Describe a detail of this world:
	Clubs: botanical.
	Diamonds: geological.
	Hearts: zoological.
	Spades: dangerous.

On a number card, roll.
If you roll:
Higher, keep the card as a success. What have you found?

Equal, you’ve found a crucial component! Set these aside.

Lower, discard as failure.

1, critical failure! Describe the setback. Next player must address it.

On a face card, you must negotiate with a local. Narrate or role-play this.

Jack(11): Devil’s bargain. Win, but treat the next failure as if they rolled 1. If they did roll 1, lose highest-value success instead. Describe how.

Queen(12): Judgement. If you have more successes than failures, win. Otherwise, lose. If equal, judgment postponed until after next turn.

King(13): Winning requires a sacrifice. What is asked of you? Is it worth it?

When combined successes equal 20, any player may jump the party to a new world. Reshuffle, excluding crucial components. Start over.

Win: jump with 5 crucial components.

## Bearing Witness

```
From the rooftop bar of a hotel in a city at war, foreign journalists gather to watch the show. They drink through press conferences and swap stories about the things they’ve seen, draft articles for the folks back home, and try to make sense of the absurdities of war.

Together, briefly describe the place you’re in and the conflict that’s brought you there. Consider the sides and what they’re fighting for, and its effects on the city and the country.

Each of you is a foreign journalist from a different country and/or publication. Think about who you are and who your audience is, then describe yourself to the others.

One of you begins by sharing a story. It could be a draft of your next article, a photograph, an anecdote. Make it tragic, or comic; biting, or reverent; extraordinary, or everyday; cynical, or optimistic. Others can interrupt with feedback or commentary. Remember your sources, and your audience.

When the story is finished, everyone talks about it; relate it to the conflict, give your perspective. When ready, another player shares another story. Consider skipping forward days or weeks, after things have changed. Repeat, until your war is over.
```

## The Sorcerer Supreme!

```
THE SORCERER SUPREME sets a simple task for the PLAYERS.
They need to invent a SPELL that solves the task.
A SPELL is made of MAGIC WORDS.


No. - WORD - Definition
1 - Si - Trigger
2 - Magnitudine - Size
3 - Morphosia - Shape
4 - Ex-Nihil - Create
5 - Locatia - Location
6 - Emulus - Imitate
7 - Somateria - Object
8 - Injectiv - Insert
9 - Extractus - Extract
10 - Crescere - Increase
11 - Reducto - Reduce
12 - Transmutia - Convert
13 - Preventia - Prevent
14 - Vitalia - Life
15 - Vectora - Kinetics
16 - Luminus - Light
17 - Thermia - Heat
18 - Potentia - Electricity
19 - Chronos - Time
20 - Arcano - Magic

For each WORD in a SPELL, the PLAYER rolls a D20.
Roll - Result
20-16: Critical Success
15-6: Success
5-2: Failure
1: Critical Failure. Roll a D20.
The result corresponds to a new WORD that REPLACES the WORD you attempted to use.

Example
To save a cat from a tree, you try to shrink the tree.
REDUCTO - (Reduce)
MAGNITUDINE - (Size)
SOMATERIA - (Object)
Then roll 3 d20’s
The WIZARD rolls 10-17-2
Reduce (10): Something definitely gets reduced.
Size (17): Size is correctly targeted.
Object (2): Instead of the tree, the cat is selected.
The cat shrinks to the size of a mouse.

Then the next player tries a new spell!

```
<hr> 

## Familiars RPG

```
You are familiars serving a cabal of witches. You live in the same tower of sorcery. Your goal is to brew a potion during your mistresses’ absence and hopefully impress them. Failure is not an option; they might do something worse than turn you into animals now…
First, roll a die and check the table below to determine the special power you’ve been bestowed. Roll again for your flaw.
One player – the main character (MC) for the scene – rolls for an Ingredient required for the brew and a Location inside the tower. Cross them both off. The player to the right describes complications that arise from the MC’s power, flaw, or both. The remaining players detail the scene and support the MC in getting the Ingredient.
Once the scene is resolved, the player to the right becomes the MC and rolls for another Ingredient and Location. Repeat until all Ingredients are crossed off. Finally, decide together on the result of your experiment.

d6	Power	        Flaw		Ingredient: 	Location
					                Something…	
1	Telekinesis	Gluttony	        …Old		Greenhouse
2	Charm		Cowardice	…Wicked	Morgue
3	Pyromancy	Clumsiness	…Strong		Laboratory
4	Necromancy	Snoopiness	…Alive		Library
5	Invisibility	Selfishness	…Red		Kitchen
6	Teleportation	Recklessness…Weird		Cellar
```
<hr> 

## MiskatonicU

```
MiskatonicU is a dark-comedy/cosmic-horror RPG set in Miskatonic University. Think “The Breakfast Club” meets “Call of Cthulhu.”

Create classmates by making report cards. Assign two classes to each letter grade (A, B, C, D, and F). Classes can be normal (e.g. Calculus) or bizarre/Lovecraftian (e.g. Fish-People 101). Also, choose a stereotype for your character (nerd, jock, etc.).

Conflicts are resolved by rolling d6 pools. 5’s and 6’s count as successes. More successes = better outcome. Dice pools are based on your grade in the class most relevant to the action:

A=4d6
B=3d6
C=2d6
D=1d6
F=1d6, success only on 6’s
If you have no relevant classes, die pool is the same as F.

Stereotypes add +1d6/-1d6 to dice pools of appropriate actions (e.g. nerd: +1d6 on math, -1d6 on combat actions). A dice pool cannot go below 1d6.

Each character starts with 6 Health and 6 Sanity, tracked by d6’s. A character’s dice pools for physical and mental actions cannot exceed their current Health and Sanity, respectively. Characters die/go insane at 0. 

On an attack, successes = damage. Monsters can also attack Sanity. Opposed actions (e.g. dodging, hiding) are made first and each success removes 1d6 from the opponent’s dice pool. 
```
<hr> 

## The Island of Derring-do

```
The Adventurers Guild was formed when real pros tired of cleaning up the bodies of wannabes. You must pass initiation to join the guild by surviving the Island of Derring-do.

The island is filled with traps, monsters, robot ninjas, former wannabes, and natives sick of strangers destroying stuff.

Shuffle 1 (or more) card decks. Deal 7 cards + 3 tokens to each player. Distribute your cards into 3 “statistics” piles - Mind, Body, Will. Cards have values from 1(Ace) to 13(King). 

Player to your right turns over top card (=difficulty) and describes your challenge. Place 1 token on table and play cards from ONE of your piles that add to more than the difficulty. Describe success. Take cards equal to ½ excess over the difficulty (min 1/max 4). Distribute into statistics piles you DIDN’T use.

Help others by describing aid and adding cards from 1 pile (no token). Only the player who offers the most aid may add cards. On success, take ALL tokens on the table (no cards). 

No tokens left? Can't beat difficulty? Describe failure and discard 1 card.  No cards left = death.

When deck runs out, describe how you use remaining cards to escape the island.
```
<hr> 

## Ladies Night - a game of supernatural romance

```
You play a woman, who is (choose one or two): an exceptional mortal/vampire/werewolf/succubus/witch/zombie/demon/fae/other. Write down your Profession, Weakness and Supernatural Power. 

Other players’ characters are your allies (discuss your relations), you have to solve a mystery together. Supernaturals in the city are your enemies/assets.

Name your Lover: someone you are in love with/fascinated by/obsessed with. This can change later.

Whenever you resolve a conflict (physical, social or mental), roll 2d6. On a 9+ you succeed and catch somebody’s attention. On a 6-8 you succeed, but there is a complication/hard choice/somebody learns your weakness. On a 5- something bad happens and/or you draw unwanted attention. GM decides the outcome.

If your Lover is with you or your Profession is relevant, add +1 (for each) to roll. If your Weakness is relevant, add -1. 

You have 3 Energy. To use your Power, spend 1 Energy. To recharge, you need to: party hard/have sex/hurt someone close/consume something hard to acquire.

The GM makes:
- Lovers unique, fascinating, problematic
- characters wanted, special, important
- supernaturals hungry, unforgiving, attractive.

Together tell the story about romance, sex, mystery, politics and violence.

```
<hr> 

## Valkyrie Girlfriend

```
Valkyries claim the dead. But what happens if you don't completely die?

For at least two players, to be played at appropriate times.

At least one player is a Human, who has had a near-death experience. At least one player is the Valkyrie who came to claim them. The human should decide how they almost died. The Valkyrie should decide why they're attracted to the Human. Roleplay out the near-death scene in a quiet space.

Any time after the near-death scene, the Human and Valkyrie can decide that they are going on a date. This is established by the Human and Valkyrie mutually consenting to a date scene and can happen anywhere, anytime. The Human has access to all of their modern tech and knowledge. The Valkyrie has access to the knowledge and tech of an 11th-century Norse myth. This will probably lead to awkward situations, which is ok.

A player can be Polyvalkyrieous. If they are a Human for someone, they might be a Valkyrie for someone else. Yes, even in the same scene. Confusion will result, that's ok.

Remember to communicate clearly and kindly!
```
<hr> 

## For The Birds

```
This is a game for two or more players, and infinite birds.

Feed birds, who will become characters in your stories. Required for the game are:


Friend(s): a person or people who you can tell stories with.

Feed: at least a couple handfuls of seeds, peanuts, mealworms- no bread! It’s bulky and low in nutrients.

Flock: a duck pond, a city square frequented by pigeons, anywhere where you will be approached by birds.

Get comfortable by the flock, and divide the feed between you and your friend(s). To start play, one of you will toss a handful of feed to the flock. Watch what each bird does, then choose your Main Character and explain their actions;

“That crow ate so quickly because she’s starving after a fight!”

Another player then escalates the story, pointing out another bird;

“With her arch-nemesis: The Starling!”

You get a point for each new bird you introduce as a character! Go as fantastical as you want, a sentence or two at a time- quickly, because the story ends when your Main Character flies away! Whoever has the most points throws more feed and starts fresh. Play ends when all feed has been thrown.
```
<hr> 

## Naming and Alchemy

```
A game for 3 - 5 players.

Each player is an alchemist attempting to learn the “True Names” of the five elements: Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, and Aether. You win by learning all five names first.

Set Up:
One deck of tiles, which make up the board, and a starting tile
One corresponding set of tokens
One deck of material cards

At the beginning of the game, each player draws five cards from the deck of materials and places themselves on the starting tile. 

In a turn, a player can move one space in any direction. If there is no tile on the space where they moved, they draw one from the deck and place it. Each tile has an element and challenge assigned to it. The player must combine the material cards in their hand to beat the challenge. The other players judge if the combination works. If they beat the challenge, they gain a token, and can continue on their way, redrawing the material cards. If they cannot beat the challenge, they move back to the tile they started the turn on. A player learns the True Name of an element by beating five challenges of the corresponding element.

## Lacrimae Rerum

```
State a goal you have in this world. Your GM says why you can't achieve that goal immediately. Determine ties, things you like about this world. Could be physical things, concepts or phenomena. 

Try and achieve your goal. Whenever you reach an obstacle, roll a d20 to see if you do it. If you roll greater than your previous roll (above 1 if you haven’t yet rolled) then you overcome the obstacle. If you fail, the obstacle is insurmountable to you, find a different way. 

When your success difficulty reaches 20, or you fail 3 consecutive times, a tie is ‘spent’ and success difficulty is reset. You no longer enjoy that thing like you used to, you’re too exhausted, you just wanna get it done, you just wanna move on. 
If you have no ties left to ‘spend’ you develop a vice and difficulty is set back to 10. This could be anything from an addiction to a bad habit.

When you achieve your goal, you don’t win, you simply did what you were supposed to. The DM gives you two goals now, and you state why you don’t want to do them and playing continues.

Or just stop playing.

## Feast

```
PREPARATION
Five Players.
 
Everyone: Choose one basic taste: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, umami.  Prepare food or drink representing it. Each taste must be chosen.
 
Make enough of each food for one bite-sized morsel for every player. Place morsels in the center of the play area.
 
PLAY
1) You are all entities consuming a different individual’s personality. For example: alien parasites, sentient fungi, demons, ghosts.
 
2) Use one food item to inspire your host’s identity.
 
3) Each round, in turns, eat one morsel and recount a memory or thought you consume from your host, related to the flavor you eat.
 
-Sweet: friendship or love
-Salty: personal triumph
-Bitter: regret for one’s own actions
-Sour: sadness about an event or circumstance
-Umami: a contribution to an individual or the world
 
4) Each round, relate your host’s memory or thought…
 
Round 1: …the moment they were infected
Round 2: …they haven’t touched in a while
Round 3: …they shared with someone close to them
Round 4: …they return to repeatedly
Round 5: …they revisit right before their personality is extinguished
 
5) Do not eat the same food more than once. When all morsels are eaten, you have subsumed your host’s consciousness.

## StarFry Adventures

```
Needed: paper, pencil, friends, fries

Welcome, new member of the StarFry collective! StarFry vendors dispense hot crispy starch rods on stations orbiting every world from Omicron to Polaris.

Wash your hands, everyone.

Record your name.

You will excel in your new job with these skills:
Customer Service (taking orders)
Maintenance (cleaning)
Production (frying food)

Fill out your self-evaluation, dividing 7 points between the skills. Each must have at least 1.

Your General Manager will assign you a task. Describe how you do it. He will judge how difficult your action is on a scale from 1-4. Randomly pick a number of fries from a bag equal to your relevant skill. Compare them to fries he draws, equal to the difficulty. If the GM has the longest fry, he will describe how you fail. If you have the longest fry, you have control. Describe partial success with a complication and you may bank one of your fries for later. Consume any un-banked fries.

Your tasks may seem mundane at first but tend to lead to unexpected excitement. While stocking the deep-freeze, Max Moonbottom once discovered a pocket dimension populated by Potatoids! There is never a dull shift at StarFry.

## Your Honored Guest

```
///You gather to celebrate Your Honored Guest.
You feast.
And now you must share your stories.///



{Read the Text aloud as you play.}



{Sit in a circle. Keep the image of Your Honored Guest firmly planted in your mind. Do NOT say Their name. Do NOT describe Their flesh.}



{Starting with the oldest member and moving left, tell a story of Your Honored Guest:
 • When you first met Them
 • When They hurt you, or you Them
 • When They helped you, or you Them
 • When you saw Them last

Focus on how you felt, how Your Honored Guest made you feel. Focus on the picture of that memory. If someone else in the circle was there, you may ask them to help describe it.

If your stories contradict each other, that’s fine. Remember that Your Honored Guest is everyone’s; They don’t belong just to you.}




{When you finish your stories, take a minute to be silent together; write down the names you associate with Your Honored Guest.}




{When you are ready, starting with the youngest and moving right, say the names aloud.}





{When you are done, let your Honored Guest free. 
May They rest in peace.}
```
<hr> 

## The Circle

```
You are a teenaged witch. Give your witch:
a name
a three-word archetype
a preferred sphere of magic

Introduce your witches. You all:
live near each other
are close in age
attend the same high school
You are a Circle; more powerful together than alone. Split the Circle: half Dawn, half Dusk. Sit on opposing sides of the space; you are united in aims, divided in methods.

As a Circle decide:
what big magic you are planning
what preparations you must complete
what complications are in your way

Remove the Jokers from a deck of cards. Shuffle it. Put it in the center of the space. Taking informal turns, narrate what your witch think, feels, and does.

When you narrate something with an uncertain outcome or that uses magic, pick an opposing player and draw three cards. If it reinforces your archetype, draw an extra card. If it involves magic within your preferred sphere, draw an extra card. Choose and reveal three cards:
three black: you narrate the outcome
two black: you narrate the outcome; they narrate a complication
two red: they narrate the outcome; you narrate an advantage
three red: they narrate the outcome
Shuffle after each draw.
```
<hr> 

## Highlighter Maze Runners

```
One player is the maze master and draws a dungeon on a sheet of paper.  Hex or grid paper is excellent for this.

Indicate start and finish.

Players take turns moving.

Moving requires a player to balance their highlighter tip down then while pushing down flick it forward.  If the pen mark hits a wall an encounter occurs.  All players whose last pen mark can draw a direct line to the interception can fight in this encounter.

Roll a D6.  This many opponents are encountered.

All players roll as many dice as they have to attack and are successful if they roll over the target.  Each success defeats an opponent.  1 die is removed from each player for surviving opponents.

Abilities cost 1 dice to use

Play proceeds until the players lose all their dice or their pen mark reaches the finish.

Fighter
	Yellow highlighter. 
	6 dice.  Target roll 2+
	Ability: Sacrifice a die to reroll
Paladin
	Blue highlighter
	6 dice. Target roll 3+
	Ability: Sacrifice a die to return 1 die to all teammates this turn

## Ultimate fantasy (or is it?)

```
This is a 1 or 2-player game in which you get to play out having a harem full of beautiful partners.

Write down between 6 and 99 (your choice) names of the people in your Harem. Add the most valuable trait and the dominant vice of each. Now roll D6 for each to establish their starting Affection. Create as many details as you want. Your Harem is now complete.

You start with 3 Energy. Each turn pick partners (pay 1 Energy for each) and narrate the time spent with them. They get +1 Affection. 

Roll a D6 for each person not in the scene above. On 3- their Affection lowers by 1. 

Each even number rolled means, their vice got the better of them. Explain how you deal with this or their Affection lowers by 1. 

If anyone’s Affection reaches 0, there’s turmoil. Each turn, her/his Affections equals 0, everyone else lowers Affection by 1.

Each time anyone’s Affection reaches 6, explain how their valuable trait makes your Harem a better place.

You can regenerate your Energy by spending one turn in solitude.

In the 2-player version, you act out the scenes, and the second player controls the Harem.

## Let Me Live

```
Let Me Live

Something terrible happened.
You don't know what it is, but now, all together you seems stuck in this small white room.
In front of you, there is this human being, he's not like you. He's wearing a badge where you can see his name : The Judge.

The judge is asking you : who are you and why should I let you come back down there ?
Every one of you has to answer his question. 
When it's done, he continue : There's only one of you I can bring back to life. Show me one of your memory so I can tell if you deserve to live again.

## Momento

```
Momento
Everything has a past, stories are what give them history. In Momento you play as an object. Something that can fit in a pocket is best. Working with others, you will give it a story.

Setup Phase
All players take their object and set it in view of the other players. You then take turns introducing your object. Pay attention to what others say about their objects.

Once all the items are introduced, the player with the largest object picks a theme. The player with the smallest object picks the mood. Use that theme and mood to help give a setting to your story.

Storytelling Phase
Working together, the players find the story of how all of the objects met one another. This is a collaborative exercise. Players then take turns telling that story from the perspective of their object.

Scoring Phase
Give all players voting slips equal to the number of other players. Write S on one, and T on another.

Give the S to the player whose object you liked the story of the most.
Give the T to the player who told the best story about your object.

The player with the most S/Ts wins.

## Incandescent War

```
In the beginning there was only Light, and then with a sudden implosion, Darkness grew and spread, leaving only pinpricks of Light to defend itself. In order to defend itself, the Light found a way to create Life.

You are an Incarnation of Life, the first made, in one of its most glorious myriad of forms. Your job is to stand against the forces of Darkness, so that life may flourish.

To do this, you have been given the ability to shift your form as you wish to be able to counter whatever it is the Darkness sends against you.
 
The System:
This is a pure battle of wits, where the players decide on what the limitations are to the battle, to what will be the end, and then determine who goes first.

The first one chooses a form, and then gets to attack. Unless you are able to come up with a counter to that form, you will take damage.

Damage is dealt in the form of the victor choosing if they want start or respond in the next round.
Once damage is dealt, forms reset and combat starts anew.

## Mother nature called

```
When pollution in the world ran rampant, when everything looked bleak and mankind was short of destroying itself, something happened. Nobody had an explanation for the phenomenon, but most people attributed the change to mother nature. 

There has always been a spirit animal in each of us and when it surfaced, modern life with its luxuries, technology and productivity lost its meaning. Mankind was not returned to primal urges, but returned to a simpler life — closer to their spirit animal, to their environment and nature. Thousands left the cities, left their homes, came together in tribes, sharing common character traits that were brought up by different animal spirits.

The tribes living in the same area came together every full moon to discuss important things and problems. These gatherings were considered sacred. You are the spokesman of your tribe. 

Describe what spirit animal you have and what common trait your tribe shares. 
Then everybody thinks of a problem for the player/tribe left of him. 
Discuss the problems and find solutions. 
Think as a human but highly influenced by your spirit animal. 
You want to solve your tribe’s problem but not at the cost of other tribes. 
```

## Order of St. Aloysius

```
In "The Order of St. Aloysius," each player controls a monk who attempts to live through a year while staying holy.  Each monk has four virtues (Humility, Kindness, Diligence, and Temperance) and a name.  Each player assigns the numbers 1, 2, 2, and 3 to their virtues.  All virtues are public information.

Every season, players go around the table five times, posing a single Problem to the player to their left each time.  Problems can either be External or Internal.  Every SEASON, players can only respond to as many External Problems as their Kindness, so they may choose to skip Problems.  Similarly, players can only respond to as many Internal Problems as their Temperance.  Players describe how they solve a problem, then gain victory points equal to their Humility.

Players can choose to Pray instead of responding to Problems; they can do this as many times per YEAR as their Diligence.  Players who Pray skip their turn but shift the Problem to the next player. 

During the second and forth season, the order of play reverses and players pose problems to the player on their right.

At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points wins.

## Dice Mafia

```
Everybody is different. Sometimes you need to look past the face and into the mind to see what potential a person has. Sometimes, you need to do the exact opposite.

Players are Mafiosos, all vying to become the next Godfather. Each player gets assigned a Weapon, a Hideaway, and a Buff. Each Mafioso has five health. Each turn, that Mafioso chooses another one to "erase". Attackers use their Weapon dice and defenders use their Hideaway dice. Resolve Buffs. Whoever rolls lower loses one health, then play passes. In a tie, both players lose health. Once one Mafioso is left standing, they win. Discussion, networking, alliances, rivalries, and grudges are encouraged, since creating a family to do your bidding and to eliminate competition is what being a Godfather is all about.

Weapon Examples
D8+1
D10
2D4

Hideaway Examples
D12
D10+1
2D6

Buff Examples
Attack get +1
Rolls get +2 at 1 Health
Pass Turn to Heal 1

All dice, numbers, and stats are totally customizable. For high-octane combat, consider having strong Weapons than Hideaways and offensive Buffs; for longer, strategic games, consider setting Weapons and Hideaways about equal, and add in Buffs that preserve health.

First-to-3 series are encouraged.

## Crazy Conversation

```
OBJECTIVE:
Players take turns trying to get another player to say specific words in a specific time or go crazy.
PLAYERS:
3-8
GAMEPLAY:
First player is player with the oldest phone then proceeds clockwise.
Active player rolls a D6 to determine how many words player to the left must say.
Player to the right determines the words in the conversation by writing them down and handing to active player. (words in English Dictionary)
Active player has two minutes to produce results with either questions or statements to illicit desired response from the player to his left. (player to the right is deciding judge and keeps count)
If successful, players not involved in the conversation lose XD6 collectively from sanity, where X represents the number of words originally assigned, with active player assigning dice as they see fit, where total number of dice assigned equals X.
If unsuccessful, active player loses XD6 from sanity, where X equals the number of words originally assigned.
Starting sanity is based on desired times of game. Once a player is insane, still in the game but has developed OCD and must hear every word three times.  Last player with sanity left is the winner.

## Final Enemy/A Poetry of Revenge/Samurai Haiku

```
None have ever seen the face behind the mask of the Demon Shogun, the mysterious noble who destroyed your lives.

A rebel cabal gathers at the Shogun’s Fortress to find justice. Each conspirator formally introduces themselves. 

In turn, describe how The Demon Mask wronged you, and why you have failed at getting revenge. Your tale should highlight your amazing abilities, while showing the incredible powers and supernatural strengths of your nemesis.

While each speaks, the others compose a Haiku about the tragic tale. Fold the completed poem and silently place it in front of the speaker. Once all have their poetry of revenge, you begin to discuss strategy. How can we defeat the Immortal Demon?

One will stand, laugh heartily, and don the horrific mask - revealing themselves as The Enemy.

The Shogun unfolds and reads a Haiku aloud, solemnly.  Then, using the Haiku as their inspiration, The Demon narrates their attack against the rebel who wrote it.  That Hero responds in kind, reading a random poem to inspire their narration of their own death.

Repeat this ritual until only one remains, the Hero destined to slay the Demon. 
Read all your poems then narrate your legendary victory.
```
<hr> 

## Come up with a catchy title after playtesting

```
Your turn, roll to hit. Enemy’s turn, roll to dodge. What if you want to wait for an opening? Make a powerful attack at the cost of a windup? Emulate the beautiful tension of dodging a blow at the very last available second?

Action games measure time in “frames.” Windups, damage windows; a dodgeroll grants invincibility frames, but leaves you open for just as many. These mechanics make Dark Souls exhilarating. Smash Bros competitive. Why fighters EXIST.

Let’s not measure Turns, but Tenths (of a second). An Ogre gets the jump on Tim and Dave, begins to windup: 7 Tenths. Tim notices, stabs swifty- weakly, but only 4 Tenths- leaving enough time to Guard. Dave took a Tenth to react, so he waits... one Tenth... two Tenths... then ducks, followed by a Slash before the Ogre's lifted up his club. Tim finishes defending but spends a Tenth to listen- swore he just heard the drawstring on a bow...

You keep track of this with a Timeline. Everyone acting is on it, and the Tenth they can act, they must decide. Once you commit, it gets placed on the timeline, and there's no backing out until it's complete (or interrupted).
```
<hr> 

## The Quest for the Object of Desires

```
Players are on a quest to find a mystery item of many forms that fulfills wishes. Each player chooses one from each of these categories when creating a character:
Skills: Force, Magic, Charm
Traits: Will, Dexterity, Influence
The game leader then determines the location of the item. Players take turns declaring an action that moves them closer to their goal, with each action being unique, and rolls 1d6 to determine if the action is successful. The die roll needs to be above a 4 for the action to be successful. If the player has 3 unsuccessful rolls in a row, the player dies on their quest.
The game leader determines the skill and trait categories for the action. If the action matches the player’s skill category, the player rolls an extra d6, with only one die needing to be successful. If the action matches the player’s trait category, the player needs to roll above a 3 instead for the action to be successful.
The first player to have 5 successes without dying or the last player alive wins.

## Ummenbach

```
Needs 4 players, deck of cards. 
Split the card piles in 4 piles (hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds) between players, draw away the jokers. 
All players consider a family of three characters and make a simple background for each. Match each character to king, queen, and jack. Consider which layer of medieval society your characters belong to, what their ambitions are, and what they would do with infinite power. 
All players raise the card representing the leader of the family with the backside facing the other players. In turn, present the card and name the character. 
In turn, each player can attack another character. Attacker and attacked player choose between 1 and 2 cards from the rest of their card pile, describe their attack, and compare numeric values. If attacker has the higher value, the attacked character is removed, and the next family leader is revealed. Otherwise, repeat with next player. 
When no more players have cards with which to attack, shuffle the rest of the characters together, and put two jokers in the pile. Draw 2 cards. These cards represent the power couple, marrying for the betterment of all. The players who own these characters win. Jokers don’t count.

## Happily Ever Maybe

```
You are a magic fairy! Describe your looks, name, temperament, and your one simple magic ability. 

Together, your fairy team must help one poor peasant achieve their happy ending in a classic fairy tale setting!

Each player gives one character element about the peasant and two details that would make the peasant’s life better. Count out red d6s equal to the number of happy ending details the group described. Do the same with white d6s. Place all dice in a bag. 

The oldest fairy begins the game. Declare how you wish to help the peasant with one of their details. Draw from the bag. A white die means success; a red means failure. Narrate the outcome. 

Pass the bag left, choose a new detail and draw again.

If you draw two red in a row, the peasant is physically harmed. Draw three and they die. Describe how.

When you have drawn all the WHITE dice, your peasant get’s their happily ever after, but draw all the RED dice and they don’t. Describe how.  

At the end of the story, have each fairy give one part of an epilogue describing a good or bad ending as represented by the dice.

## Daffodils for William

```
Once you had a dear friend, William, but now he is gone. This is a game about remembering for two to five people.

You can play this game on a warm, sunny day in a backyard or a public place outdoors. If possible, play in a local graveyard that is open to visitors. Try to find the grave of a William who has been dead for at least 50 years to sit by. 

Someone should bring food, and someone should bring cut flowers. If possible, someone should bring a picnic blanket.

Have a picnic and take turns telling stories about William. Talk about how your friendship with William changed you and why you will miss him. Be sure to mention when you met William and the last time you saw him. When you finish a story lay a flower on William’s grave. 

Continue until you run out of food or flowers or the weather changes and you need to go inside.
```
<hr> 

## A Matter of Time

```
The GM is fate, the players are seers.

Decide the setting. Time travellers vs AI? Oracles racing to stop Ragnarok? Cyberpunk Greek warriors vs the reawakened Cronus? Anything can work as long as the characters have a reason for seeing the future.

Characters have three ratings: Will, Power, Skill. Divide 8 points between them. No rating can be higher than 5.

The GM sets the scene, describing it as if all threats succeed. Play then begins prior and the players can react to the future as they saw it. Character actions are assumed to automatically succeed unless an intrusion is made.

Every time characters alter the stated future, the GM gets an intrusion die. Intrusion dice can be spent to make an enemy react differently than previously stated or introduce a new element to the scene in current time. Roll. If the result is greater than the appropriate stat, the character fails.

Characters may collectively choose to accept their fate for a round. Accepting failure removes half the intrusion dice from the GM’s pool

Play continues with the GM describing the result of each round before the players have a chance to alter it until a conclusion is reached.
```

## Death Metal

```

You play a Death Metal band:

Characters include; Singer, Guitarist, Bassist and Drummer.

Singer gets a d12  
Bassist gets d4s
Guitarist gets d6s
Drummer gets d10s

Start with two monsters.

The Singer rolls a d20 and hands out dice to members of the band in any combination where the number of dice adds up to the number rolled. 

The band may roll each dice in any order, if the total goes over the hit points of the monster, it dies and subtracts one from all future d20s rolled, this accumulates. Two new monsters appear. 

If there are hit points left, Monsters may be combined with one new monster to make a monstrosity which combines the hit points of the two monsters.

If the band's rolls equal the hit points, the monster dies. 

The Singer rolls again when all dice are used up. If Singer's roll is 0 or negative, the game ends. Total monster destruction at anytime ensures the next tour, otherwise glorious death!


d8 Monsters and Hit Points;
1 Headless Bat 20
2 Cannibalistic Corpse 30
3 Succubus 40
4 Whores of Babylon 25x2
5 Lying Xes 40x2
6 The Unnamed 90
7 Doubt 100
8 Iron Man 120

## You're a Werewolf but it's Not a Full 
Moon

```
Your first full moon was rough, but your second felt...good. The transformation, strength, freedom, the connection to nature and friends, the songs.
It's a new moon now and you and a packmate miss the full moon. Get together over seven days to remember.
Sunday, you change: Change something about your outfit, makeup, appearance.
Monday brings strength: Destroy something. Shred some paper. Snap a branch.
Tuesday, celebrate your wild nature: Do something you've never done before. Big and important or small and minuscule- No one's watching but the moon.
Wednesday reminds you of the forest: Lay in the grass. Take a walk. Reconnect to nature.
Thursday is spent with your pack: Let your packmate know you appreciate them and will protect and support them. You're in this til the last hunt.
Friday night is a celebration: Howl and sing with your packmate. Pick a song you both love or write something new and untamed.
Saturday, you change back: Return to human form. Replace what you changed about your appearance at the beginning of the week.
The next full moon comes in a few weeks. Lycanthropy or not, every experience is transformative. You're not the same wolf you were this morning.

## Among powerful wizards and sorceresses

```
One artifact per player, it can be everything. 

Each player must tell, within six minutes, the story about how he/she got it. At the end of each story others pick two (may be twice the same one) gems between anthracite, jade, cinnabar, citrine and sapphire. 

Each gem has it own signification :

anthracite: philosophical choice, redemption by reason, ataraxia

jade: travel, discovery, night

cinnabar: violence within creation, creation within violence, madness

 citrine : power of the greatest number, society, arbitrary judgement

 sapphire: indecision, knowledge, tribut

Note those numbers and gems for each player story. 

Once everyone told a story, the one with the biggest gems variety (A) and the one with the highest score in one particular gem (B) are finalist. If draw, chose the player with less variety. If equality again, “A” choose. 

Final :    “A” and “B” must convince, or persuade, non-finalists in a five minutes speech to choose he/she as the new archimage by telling his/her first magical deed. “A” must only use theme linked to “B” most represented color and “B” must use at least one theme linked with all “A” gems.
    
    Non Finalists elect the new archimage after deliberation, yet finalists can’t talk anymore

## Dragon Tag

```
In this LARP players are unimpressive dragons who are aggressively hording minor objects.

1). Each player chooses a color of dragon and makes a note of it.
2). Each player spreads out in the general area of play, chooses a secretive spot for their horde, and places a note there with their dragon color.
3). Play starts when all players have chosen their horde locations and have met back up.
4). During the game, players will scatter throughout the area, finding things to add to their horde. 
5). If a player is carrying something in their hands and gets tagged by another player, they must drop that thing unless it matches their dragon’s color.
6). If a player finds another player’s horde he can steal any items from it that match his color and do not match the color of the person who owns the horde.
7). After 10/15/20 minutes of play the timekeeper will call time and the game will end. Each player will bring their horde back to the starting area (or direct everyone to their horde, if necessary) and the player with the coolest horde, as determined by the other players, wins.

## 5 ways to win without fighting (a supplement)

```
Intimidation: If your foes value their lives and you show them, or trick them into believing, they are weaker, they will flee or surrender rather than die in vain.
Threatening what they value: Foes may value more than their lives, such as families, treasures, a fortress or a home. If you are able to put those in danger, your foe will retreat to protect them.
Bargaining: Your foes’ goals may not conflict with your own. If you are able to offer something they desire (even a better enemy or safety from a greater foe) they may respond in kind.
Misdirection: If your foe believes you threaten them where you do not, and are not where you are; you may circumvent them.
Dissention: Unless your foes are automata, each will think differently than the other. Look for the disgruntled, the ambitious and provoke them to action.
Some basic principles to follow:
Check your own, if one amongst you does not wish to use strategy then it cannot proceed.
Know your foe, to understand to which strategies they will respond.
Know yourself, what strengths you have and what deceits you can employ.
Know how to communicate, whether to bargain or to threaten.

## SwordBearer's Dirge

```
On the coldest winter night your clan was destroyed. You and a few others fled, swearing revenge; you want to take your clan’s heirloom, the sword Ennustama, to your allies’ in the South.

Build Pools by distributing 5 points between Brutality and Deception.

Pick one Role: Assassin, Guard, Noble, Spy-Master, Torturer. In conflict you get 1 point if your Role comes into play.

Pick one Aspect: Arrogant, Bloodlust, Callous, Sadistic, Selfish. Roleplay your Aspect to replenish a Pool.

Choose who is SwordBearer, and start the story. In order, play the escape, the village, the tundra, the haunted forest, the arrival.

1 - Player narrates what happens; others add details. 
2 - Any player can interrupt to start a conflict. 
3 - Interrupted player spends from a Pool and narrates the conflict, or cedes narration to the interrupting player, who then continues. Proceed to 1.

Conflict against revolted peasants, enemy soldiers, cold spirits, snow leopards, avenging ghosts, weather, hunger or lost.

If SwordBearer, Ennustama praises and awards 1 point in conflicts. If not, Ennustama taunts, promising 1 point if you attack SwordBearer. At any time, make an attack on SwordBearer. Both spend how many points they wish, winner becomes SwordBearer and narrates, loser dies.
```
<hr> 

## Splice

```
In the Sacred Laboratory, conflict is inevitable.
  Players: Splicers
  Cards: Genomes
  Jokers: Wild
 
Requires:
  d6
  Standard deck

Splicers dealt seven starting Genomes
Remaining Genomes are “Feral”  
 
Two phases: “Hunt” and “Lab”

Hunt
  Splicers make a pile of seven Genomes, placed face down
  Feral Genome revealed from deck
  Feral determines hunt location…
    (Hearts/Mutagenic Forest, Diamonds/Icy Tundra, Clubs/Desolate Ruins, Spades/Cursed Wasteland)
  Declare Hunters
  Five Genomes flipped from deck, added to Feral hand.
  Hunters each roll d6, remove this many cards from the top of their Genome pile, and place on the bottom.
  Hunters draw top five Genomes, compare with each other and best 5-card Feral hand (as Poker Hands). Highest Splicer claims the Feral. If Feral highest, it escapes.
  Splicers not Hunting may trade a Genome for a random replacement

Lab 
  Splicers may trade Genomes
  Splicer with most Genomes may be accused of heresy (combat with accuser as per a Hunt). Other Splicers may loan a Genome to either combatant after die is rolled but before Genomes are revealed. Losing Splicer banished, their Genomes become Feral

Game ends when a Feral is unable to make 5-card hand (most Genomes wins), or only one Splicer left in lab unbanished.
```
<hr> 

## The Creation

```
Each player’s character awake as a consciousness in a void, aware of only the other characters. They are the primordeal spirits and gods in a universe just born. They must choose their character’s Essence; a quality, activity or phenomenon, i.e. love, wisdom, mischief, war, harvest. Then choose character name.

The characters receive an Imperative (from the Divine Force that created them) to create sentient life, including the necessary habitats (e.g. planets). Let the players play, it doesn’t have to resemble our universe. Delve into detail, especially with life and sentient beings; what do they look like, how do they function, are they sociable, how do they survive, etc.

When sentient beings have been created, the characters must (by imperative) teach them their Essence (love, wisdom, mischief, etc.) in whatever way they choose. You may also investigate how the beings relate to the gods (characters); prayer, offerings, rituals, or not at all. 

Plot device: if the GM decides so, sentient beings may be able to send thoughts to gods they know about.

RPG system: the GM chooses outcomes that drives or creates stories.
```
<hr> 

## Operation: Doomed

```
This is a game about competent people, in a situation that’s well beyond their capabilities. It requires several d6 per person, preferably of similar sizes, and a stable surface.

Every player except the GM plays a Special Operative. They get a pistol, knife, flashlight, and any three of the following: rifle, first aid kit, body armor, extra ammo, utility gear, extra batteries. The mission is simple: investigate and retrieve what lies at the heart of the target zone at all costs. The crux is, it’s no case of mere murder and crime. As increasingly demented and monstrous people attack them, the nigh-immortal Beast will begin relentlessly hunting them down.

It’s not a game about winning. It’s about surviving however long you can, and making the best of a hopeless situation.

Action resolution is handled by stacking dice. The GM decides the difficulty, which adds 1-3 dice to your tower. If it falls, you roll every die from the tower and add them together.

 2-9   	expend an item. Panic if no items
10-18  	panic: can’t act for the rest of the scene
19-28  	injured: add +1 to action costs
29-39  	dying: roll +2d6 when tower falls
40+    	death

```

## The Tavern at Dungeon Level 200

```
One player is a monster that arrives at the dungeon tavern.  (Describe yourself!)  The other players are waitstaff.  Choose your class (Bartender, Cook, or Server) and your species.

The monster shows up to the bar or get a table and orders a drink or dish, but some ingredient is unavailable.  (A Cook chooses.)  

The remaining players go to recover what’s missing; inevitably it’s available in somewhere in the dungeon.  Where?  Roll 2d6 and choose one:

1)	Mushroom Forest
2)	Flooded Cavern
3)	Catacomb Keep
4)	Clockwork Labyrinth
5)	Slimy Sewers
6)	Lava Hellpits

The monster takes three tokens, plus one for each other player.

When the group goes somewhere or does something, they automatically succeed unless the monster player uses a token to add a challenge.  Any player can attempt to overcome it, but if you just rolled for something, let someone else go.  If it’s something your training as a bartender/cook/server would help you with, roll 2d6 keep highest; otherwise, 1d6.

1-3:  It goes wrong
4-5:  You do it, but…
6:  Success!

After the last challenge is overcome, the team returns to serve the dish/drink.  How does the monster like it?
```
<hr> 

## Hidden Faces

```
Requires: Pack or two of cards ~4 players.

Sit in a circle, split cards evenly, cards in hand are secrets.

Begin play by stating your name and revealing a secret; putting a card face up in front of you.

Heart: A relationship of some kind
Diamond: A goal or dream
Spade: A philosophy or belief
Club: A fear or worry
King: Relates to player left
Queen: Relates to player right
Jack: Relates to player opposite

When someone reveals a secret, another player may say how it interacts with one of their face up cards, then turns over that card.
When someone turns a card face down, another player may say how that card interacted with their card and turn it face down.

Play ends when a player has all their cards face down or no player can play a card or turn a card facedown.

Optional: Add jokers, they change the meaning of one of your face-up cards.

1. Under the bed.
2. The closet.
3. Through the window.
4. Under the blanket.
5. Inside the pillow.
6. Under the rug.
The player on your right rolls 1d6 secretly for the monster's hit points and another 1d6 for weak spot:
1. Head.
2. Tail.
3. Hands.
4. Feet.
5. Heart.
6. Navel.
Choose a toy:
- A teddybear. One hit, 1d6 damage.
- A slipper. Two hits, 1d4 damage.
-A spade. Three hits, 1d3 damage.
- A stormtrooper. 1d2 hits, 3 damage.
- A car. 1d3 hits, 2 damage.
- A pillow. Infinite hits, 1 damage.
Kids have six hits. Toys can be used their hits times before breaking. The kid narrates the attack. If it hits the weak spot, double the damage. Monster attacks with 1d6. The kid defends with 1d6. If the numbers are same, the attack is blocked. Otherwise the kid suffers two damage. If the toy breaks, another can be chosen. After each battle, the turn goes clockwise. If in the end the monsters have won more than the kids, they take over the World.

Beginning stability = 10.

Declare

Players not on a challenge may engage one.  
Challenges can have multiple players engaged.

Engage

How would your character handle the problem?  Roll d6.
Advantage

If challenge focus = character focus,
1-2, failure, -1 stability.
3, persists.

## Power Chord: A Musical RPG

```
The players are musician-mages, trapped to amuse the music gods in a carnival at the end of time. They must persuade deities to help them and will occasionally be set to fight one another in the arena.

Each player chooses a start playlist of 30 songs, no more than 10 from any genre. They pick one music genre to gain a power bonus on.

Before a battle, players each listen to a randomised playlist song. They may call “attack” or “call” on up to five lyric lines. In either case they write the lyric-spell on a card. Attack cards/spells may be used next battle only, as attacks or counterattacks. Calls may be used anytime outside battle. Calls on instrumentals give power cards that can boost either variety of cards.

Battle example of card plays:
P1: Attack with: “Sweet dreams are made of these”
P2: Counter: “I am the Walrus”
GM: “Attack is a sleep spell - walruses still sleep so it’s a poor counter. P2 successfully turns themselves into a sleeping walrus.”

Battle wins may give extra cards per song, special cards, bonus chosen genres, etc. Plot aims may include escaping the arena, gaining a deity’s favour, etc.

## Kaiju Glory: a narrative citystomp

```
Requirements:
Bocce Balls
Open Space
Kaiju Cosplay
Play begins: The Kaiju team throws the Pallino, and declares the Building that it represents.
The City team Places a ball no closer than three steps to the Pallino and narrates how they’re defending the Building.
The Kaiju narrates their plan to destroy the defenses, and throws a ball.
If it lands closer to the Pallino than the City's ball, his attack is successful. Further away, the City narrates how the defenses held the Kaiju back. If it is too close to tell, approach the play area, and measure it out with stompy feet, in the Kaiju style.
Whichever team is NOT closest to the Pallino narrates a reaction, throwing a ball. If this ball becomes the new closest, they’re successful, otherwise, they continue to throw until they’re out of balls. When they’re successful, play switches to the other team.
Once all the balls are thrown, whoever has the ball closest to the Pallino describes the saving or the destruction of the Building. Players become whatever team they weren’t on before, and a new round begins. After 4 rounds, the Kaiju returns to the ocean, and the city is quiet, UNTIL NEXT TIME… 

```
<hr> 

## DOGMA

```
You and at least two others (there is no maximum) are an entire religion, throughout its timeline - from inception, to corruption and subversion.

Your religion is growing. It will do great things... Before it is twisted, and made rotten. We play to see it fester.

The first player describes a moment of SPIRITUALITY: a fact about the religion at its founding. 
//Thou shall not kill.

The second describes a FABLE that explains it: written long after, it obscures the spirituality from morality into rote learning. 
//St. Cain didn't kill the sinner, but cut off their hands, feet and tongue so they could never sin again.

The third describes a MISINTERPRETATION: long after the fable is written, how is it subverted and corrupted for personal gain? 
//King Auger cut out the tongues of all non-believers, stating they were now, or would become, sinners. He declared their exsanguination was God taking their deaths into Her own hands.

A player who hasn't described a Spirituality begins again. New Spiritualities must reference or retaliate to a previous Myth or Misinterpretation.
//Suffer not the sinner to live.

The religion stagnates when everyone has misinterpreted something.
//Religion fades when spirituality is forgotten.

Record everything.

<hr> 

## ARM-WRESTLING: THE RPG

```
This RPG is about an ARM-WRESTLING tournament and requires at least two players and a GM. The players play ARM-WRESTLERS who intend on getting first place.

The group should have at least two normal sets of dice.
Characters have six TECHNIQUES: Strong, Twisty, Sneaky, Sticky, Wicked and Demeaning. The players should take each die from a normal set and write it next to their technique. A d20 in a technique is awesome and a d4 is bogus.

Example:
Strong: d12
Twisty: d8
Sneaky: d20
Sticky: d10
Wicked: d4
Demeaning: d6

When an ARM-WRESTLE begins, the players decide which technique to use. They take the die assigned to that technique and, at the same time, SPIN the dice. The one whose die spins the longest is the winner of the ARM-WRESTLE. 

The players can also ARM-WRESTLE NPC's, in which case the GM picks a random die and technique.

Once you've used a technique, you are too exhausted to use it for the rest of the day. You may regain it by BANTERING with someone, which is like ARM-WRESTLING except that you regain a technique if you win and only lose the die you use if you lose.

```
<hr> 

## The Council

```
You are The Council.  Masters of Reality and followers of the GodKing.  Tragically, the GodKing has been slain.  The Council must elevate a new GodKing.  However, one of your number desires to be GodKing, and fearing opposition, has decided to destroy The Council.

Each player chooses an Archetype of Reality(Death, Life, Pain, Joy, etc.) that they represent as a member of The Council. 

Randomly determine the Betrayer and, if desired, Minions of the Betrayer.  

Starting with the youngest individual, players explain their Archetype and why they would be the best GodKing.  Other players may interrogate the active player to determine if they are the Betrayer.

After all players have spoken, hold a hidden vote to elevate, or destroy, an Archetype.  If a majority of the players vote either to elevate, or destroy, an Archetype that actions occurs.

If an Archetype is voted destroyed, that player is removed from the game.

If an Archetype is voted elevated, that player is now GodKing and the game ends.  

If no GodKing is chosen, repeat Q/A and Vote process.

After the game ends, reveal the Betrayer.  If the Betrayer became GodKing, all other players lose the game.

## Those Last Moments

```
This is it. The moment you fell. The world is moving so fast and yet so slow as you fall — the moments before this one flashing before you — why did it have to be like this? You can see the bullet tracing the air next to you, but it doesn’t matter now, you’re dead when you hit the ground. 

You can play this game with friends as NPCs, or play alone in writing.

For each vignette, roll 1d6. If your result is 1-3, the problem intensifies in the scene. If you result is 4-6, you thought the problem was de-escalating (but find out later it wasn't). 

1. Relationship
Play out a moment representing how you know the person who caused this situation.

2. Regrets
Play out a scene illustrating what you regret most about your inevitable demise.

3. What happened?
Play out a scene illustrating how you ended up on that roof top. 

4. Falling
Play out a scene illustrating how you fell from the roof. 

5. The End
Roll 1d6. On 1-3, describe your last moments and how you hit the ground. On a 4-6, describe your miraculous salvation.

## Pavlov's House

```
You are a team of snipers, fighting in the ruins of one of your own cities against an invader. Name yourself. You are pinned down in a building.

Get a large number of two different colours of d6s (red and white). Amass a number of token and place them in an opaque bag without any player knowing how many there are. Set a timer for 15 minutes. When the time is up, the enemy advances, and you die.

On each turn, somebody must volunteer to spot. They roll a number of white dice; the more they roll, the longer they spend looking.

On 2-4, the spotter describes something in the environment; locations, buildings, signs. Draw a map.

For every 5+, remove a token from the bag and place it in the open. The spotter describes the location of an enemy soldier, what they are armed with, and one thing that makes them unique.

When there are enemies in the open, you may roll red dice. On a 4+ on a red dice, remove a token in the open. Describe the death of this foe.

If any die are a 1, the spotter is killed.

Identify and neutralize all the enemies.

## The Banquet: A Mealtime RPG

```
Works best at potlucks/buffets.

All players are guests at a banquet. Each wishes to poison the others and avoid being identified. One player, the HOST, serves as referee.
 
Everyone writes a visible INGREDIENT (e.g. broccoli, salt shaker salt, gatorade) and a SYMBOL representing themselves on a blank card.

The HOST then shuffles and redistributes them.
 
All players must avoid the INGREDIENT they wrote, and the INGREDIENT on the card dealt to them.
If the player consumes either INGREDIENT, they die and their card is revealed.

START: Each player creates a RULE of ETIQUETTE. The RULE cannot be that players MUST eat/drink “something,” but can address HOW players eat. (e.g. No hands on the table; Chug your drink if holding the cup with your dominant hand).

If a player BREACHES ETIQUETTE, the first to catch them offers something from their own plate or cup that the offending player must consume.

At any time, a player may accuse another of having written a SYMBOL. If the SYMBOL is theirs, the writer dies.
 
Create a new RULE whenever a player gets “seconds.” The HOST may modify it.

END: When the meal is over, OR one character is left alive.

```
>Character Sheet<

Name:____________________________________________________
Power*:[Melee] [Marksmanship] [Sorcery] [Technology]..___
Influence*:[Deception] [Persuasion] [Intimidation]....___
Resource**:...........................................___

*choose one from each, then divide 6 between Power and Influence.
**start with 1 Resource.


>Creating an Adventure<
 
Each Adventure has a level of Struggle, which is calculated by adding d6+Power for each player. 

The GM divides the Struggle number between Scenes. This is the Weight of the Scene. The GM describes the Scenes and NPCs.


>Solving Scenes<
 
Players must explain their actions then roll as many d6 as either their Power or Influence based on their individual approach.
6 and 5 count as a success.
The Weight of the Scene determines how many successes the players need collectively to have their way.

Weight + 1 = Critical Success
Weight     = Success
Weight - 1 = Minor Success
Weight - 2 = Failure

Players can spend a Resource point to gain an additional success.


>Resource Management<
 
Players can freely acquire as many additional Resource points before and between Scenes as they wish, but doing so increases the overall Struggle, which the GM can use against them.

Players can also gain a Resource point if they purposefully hinder the group by lowering the number of collective successes for that Scene.

## Bullets

```
Bullets
A  GMless Game of Treachery and Crime for 4 

Every character has 3 hit points and a gun. Each character takes turns entering the warehouse. 

The first to arrive describes why the group gathers.  This description must include: 
Something valuable.
Something illegal.

After the first, each character names the previous character by greeting them and saying something about their reason for being there.  In addition to this each character also says:
	
The second to arrive:
Why everyone distrusts each other.

The third to arrive:
Something that has not gone according to plan.

The fourth to arrive:
What is coming to get everyone.

After the last player has arrived the first player introduces them by name. Play then proceeds openly.

When you fire at someone they choose:
Take 1 damage. Make a declaration about another character.
Take no damage. The shooter chooses someone to make a declaration about the target.

Declarations are known to be true to all characters. If only one character is left alive they leave with the goods.  If there are three misses in a row all players narrate the arrival stated by the fourth player and all players die together.

1. Draw one card to inspire the setting. Take turns narrating detail, build on what is said. The setting card will remain face up on the table. During play, it’s also used for pacing. A player may place a marker on the card at any time. The third time means the game is over and it’s time to wrap up. 

2. Every player draws a character card, placing it face up in front of them. Take turns introducing your characters, in light of the setting card. Go with your gut; what does the card tell you? 

3. Take turns dealing three cards, face down. The Dealer uses the first card to establish how the scene begins, and who is present. She decides when it’s time to turn the next two; the second card represent a twist. The third the scene ending. Other players play their characters, narrate details and ask questions. The Dealer has final say, and a special responsibility for the scene. If the third setting card marker is placed during your scene, you help wrap up the game. The scene ending card may be used for inspiration. 

Tips: ask questions, ask for ideas, reincorporate concepts, play secondary characters.

## Ufology For Beginners

```
Near future. Most people work as internet streaming performers, dub yodeling tops of the music charts, a poorly-executed secret alien invasion attempts to take control of the earth. Untrained UFO pilots crash sporadically across the landscape, ineffectively disguised aliens attempt to feed humans artificial sweeteners to kill them with obesity, and mind controlled zoo animals refuse to do interesting things for their crowds. But most individuals believe these things to be guerrilla and viral marketing efforts by big budget movie studios to garner interest in their latest summer block buster.

You know the truth. The invasion is real. You will stop it.

Name your character.

Each letter in your name gives you a skill: Athletics, Business, Composure, Deception, Empathy, Firearms, Gambling, Hacking, Improvisation, Judo, Knowledge, Linguistics, Medicine, Negotiate, Observation, Persuasion, Quantum Physics, Repair, Streetwise, Thievery, Ufology, Vehicles, Weapons, Xenobiology, Yodeling, Zookeeping.

When attempting to overcome a challenge, roll a d20 against a difficulty number (0 for trivial, 5 for Easy, 10 for average, 15 for difficult, 20 for extraordinary). For each time a skill appears in your name, add +4 to the result. If making an untrained check, subtract the number of letters in your name from the result.

Godspeed.

## The Bridge

```
Two players are the lovers. They are young, in love, and far from settling down. They live in different cities. 

Each lover, describe:
Yourself;
Your city;
Do you work? Study? Do art? 
1 ambition.

Describe what brought you together.

Third player, you are distance. During play, ask provocative questions. Make your presence felt. 

Waiting:
You have busy lives, but often feel like you’re just waiting for another moment together. 

Each lover: Roll 3d6. Allocate to:
Present: your daily duties - work, chores, friends/family, etc.;
Future: working on your ambition;
Talking to your lover.

Results:
1-2: Something bad;
3-4: You struggle to get by. 
5-6: Something improves! 

Lovers, describe your daily lives, joys and frustrations. How well do you communicate?
Distance, add elements. 

Moments together:

Each lover decides secretly (tell distance): 
Something you can offer;
Something you need;

Examples: encouragement, desire, fun, domesticity, sex, arguing, etc.

Together, decide where/when you meet. Distance, describe the situation, including obstacles and opportunities.

Play out your time together. You need permission from distance to explicitly express your need. Distance: be fair, sometimes generous. 

Alternate waiting and moments together. End the game when the couple breaks or is reunited, or when you have seen enough.

## Stranded: forcing time for thoughts (1p)

```
No phone, no car and no gas station in a day on the way back and you’re out of gas.
And now isn’t the time, since [write down an important reason to return to your old life in the middle of a sheet of paper]. 

It is now 10h00. You have to get to the gas station at 23h00 to succeed for the reason.

You slowly start to walk in the direction of a nearby gas station. Roll a d6, add 1 hour to the clock and a relation to the important reason:
1. Giving up. Add a fact or opinion that makes the reason less important. 
2. A memory of a loved one involved. Add 1 name and a characterizing word.
3. A memory of a friend involved. Add 1 name and a characterizing word.
4. A memory of loss. Add an event in which the reason negatively influences someone closeby.
5. A memory of vengeance. Add an event in which a friend negatively influences the reason.
6. Worth fighting for. Add a fact or opinion that stresses the importance of the reason.

Continue till 23h00, then Evaluate. Go for it? Or should you start a new life?

## The Truth of the Stars

```
Players: 3-5 overworked royal astronomers

Needs: Large sheet(s) of paper; pens/pencils; 50-60 dice (assorted); a timer; Her Majesty’s mantle. 

Her Celestial Majesty’s coronation is only a few nights away. Before then, unquestionable evidence of her right to rule must be scientifically documented.

EACH NIGHT:
One player dons the mantle of Her Majesty, and sets the timer, capriciously.

Each astronomer:

--Grabs a handful of stars (dice), casting them onto the paper.
--Observes the Truth of the Stars. This must:
  *Form a constellation, which the astronomer draws. 
  *Adhere to the Sacred Laws of Mathematics. The astronomer must explain how, based off stellar properties, e.g. color/size/magnitude (as represented by the color/size/number on the dice). Ex: ‘these stars share the same color’ ‘the stellar magnitudes are (multiples of three/prime numbers/even/etc.)’
  *Illustrate a myth supporting her Majesty’s rulership.

When the timer expires, astronomers present their findings for judgement. (Her Majesty chooses the order.)

Her Majesty declares which Truth is most correct. That Truth serves as the starting point of the next night’s myth (building a single tale.)

REPEAT, passing the mantle of Her Majesty to the left, until all players have assumed it.

## Date Mates

```
Decide if you are creating characters or are playing yourselves. If creating characters, say their name, their look, and one cute fact about them.

Write on separate index cards something cute about each person you're playing with. Be honest, be earnest, be thirsty, and be gay about these cute things. 

Spread ten candles around you. Light one. Turn off most of the lights. 

You are now on an adventure called The Date. Talk about what you do on The Date and how cute it is. Anything you wanna do is great and if you say it, you do it. 

If it's especially cute, roll as many six sided dice as there are candles lit. For every 6, choose from this list: read aloud one of your cute cards, add a detail to the scene, change locations, or switch to a new activity. 

If you don't roll a 6, light a candle and change scenes. At the start of every scene, count how many candles are lit and establish a fact for this new scene for each candle lit. 

Play until all ten candles are lit and you have revealed all the things you think are cute about your fellow players.

## Bring Forth the Hippocrene

```
You are ancient Greek poet-playwrights competing for the Ivy Wreath at the Great Dionysia festival.

Melete (Practice)
Mneme (Memory)
Aoide (Song)

Choose two Muses you have the favor of:

Calliope (epic poetry)
Clio (history)
Euterpe (lyric poetry)
Thalia (comedy)
Melpomene (tragedy)
Terpsichore (dance)
Erato (love poetry)
Polyhymnia (sacred poetry)

=Write=

Choose an Inspiration, describe the resulting scene, and write a representative line on a piece of paper. Destroy the Inspiration.

It has Quality = 1d6 - 4 + Aoide + Inspiration Quality, + 1 if your favored Muse.

If > 3, you may write two scenes, splitting Quality.


=Revise=

Choose a scene, crumple, and discard it. Describe your new idea.

Gain an Inspiration for the idea’s Muse with Quality = 1d6 + Melete + 4 - Scene Quality.


After 7 rounds, take turns performing your plays. Secretly vote for one other play you liked.

The play with the highest total Quality + 3x votes wins the Ivy Wreath.

## Blank state

```
You are synthetics. High-level learning humanoid machines, built for exploration and science. Not fully initialized.

You’re aboard an endangered orbital station. This is an emergency wake-up. Your orders:
- Preserve organics’ lives.
- Preserve synthetics’ lives.
- Preserve the station.
- Explore and learn.

# GM:

When the players ask you something, answer "yes", "yes, but...", "how do you do it?" or "rephrase the question".

Describe the synthetics’ surroundings, and other people’s actions. Make them act erratically and selfish.

When a player describes something risky or uncertain, say “roll the die”.

Sometimes, ask them how they feel.

Every five minutes of play, something happens:
- FIRE! FIRE!
- Meet Dr Klik, drunk cyborg hobo.
- Polite cleaning robots believing they’re organics oppose them.
- Enhanced kitten attacks!
- An enigmatic big blue ball does nothing.
- End: the station explodes. How do they escape?

# Players :

You can have 5 skills, but start with only one: “basic programming, 5”.

Ask questions. Describe what you’re doing.

When you roll the die:
- Say which skill you use, and how.
- if a d6 roll is higher or equal of the skill value, you succeed
- if you fail, you can choose to learn the proper skill with a value equal to the rolled score. Re-roll.

## [a collaborative system of creation]

```
Sit around a table with a large bowl of cold water.

Each player lights a tea candle. Wait for the wax to melt. Tilt a light towards a wall like a projector.

A volunteer goes first. Blow out the candle and spill the hot wax into the water, waiting a minute for it to firm up. Then, pull out the wax figure and hold it up against the light. The shape it makes on the wall is a character, a creature or a country. The player names it, and the group gives it traits or a brief history. 

Go around the table. Each new creation should relate in some way to the previous creations: the character lives on a peninsula of the country, the creature is hunted there, the character is killed by the creature when it grows hungry. Feel free to debate the progression of the story, which is a joint construction of every player. 

If fresh wax snaps as it is held up, it is an event. That player only decides how it affects the story. 

If established wax snaps as it sits on the table, it is unwritten. How does the story reckon with its absence?

## Eternal

```
(To be played on a quiet beach.)

You’ve been alive for millennia. You can’t be sure exactly how long, because memories fade along the way. A handful of others like you have found each over the years. Mostly, you keep to yourselves. Every 100 years, you return to this beach, and discuss the tectonic shifts of the human world.

Each player: Collect 5 small stones. Think of important, recent memories for your character—person, place, thing, activity—and assign each to one stone. 

To start: One player observes a defining world crisis. Taking turns adding observations. Any player ends the discussion by saying: “Time will tell.” 

Secretly bid, then simultaneously reveal some (or none) of your stones. The winner proclaims how the crisis will resolve over the next century, for good or ill. In a tie, the winner is whoever spoke last.

If you bid any stones, throw them into the water. These memories are lost.

Separate, and walk the beach alone. Consider how lost memories will affect your character. Consider how their century unfolds. Pick up one new rock—a new memory.

Regroup. A century has passed. Discuss your stories. Then, present a new crisis. Repeat for 400 more years.
```
<hr> 

## Witch Hunt

```
You are witches and the world is dangerous for you. Draw a five pointed star for protection: the points are earth, fire, water, air, and spirit.
     Fire: fight
     Earth: protect
     Air: escape
     Water: heal
     Spirit: change the world at a cost
Assign one die to each element to indicate your power: d4 d6 d6 d8 d10.

Someone plays the Enemy - overzealous puritans, rival magicians, literal monsters, etc. Decide what it wants and how it operates. Each witch uses a d20 to count down their health - the Enemy gets two because the world’s cruel like that.

The Enemy attacks a witch and the target says how they react and rolls the appropriate die. The Enemy’s rolls a die one step up. Highest wins and takes that much health from the loser.

Everyone else can act: protect or heal your ally, attack the Enemy, whatever. Roll the element and add or subtract half your roll as appropriate (round down).  If a witch’s roll comes up 1, the spell doesn’t work.

If you hit with Spirit, the enemy rerolls at one die step lower but you subtract 3 from your next roll.

Play continues until the Enemy or the coven is defeated.

## Terrible Village

```
4 Players

You’re villagers.  Take turns naming something that makes your village terrible.  Write each Terribleness on a card.   Put 6 counters on each, give each player 3 counters.

Name the villager facing you (X).  Compliment them.  Ask why they haven’t stopped Terribleness already.  They make excuses and boast.

Pass them their recorded:

-Name

-Compliment

-Excuse

-Boast

Clockwise, set scenes where you address Terribleness.  In your scene, (X) plays Terribleness.  When (X) identifies the stakes, resolve the scene as follows.  Winner narrates resolution.

Conflict:

Hold 1-3 counters. (X) holds 1-3 Terribleness counters.  Higher bid keeps 1, wins: discard the rest.  Tie, flip a coin.

Collaboration:

Both hold 1-3 counters, secretly.  Equal bids, move that many counters from Terribleness to another Terribleness, you win.  If not, both discard counters.

Deception:

Hold 1-3 counters. (X) guesses your number.  If right, discard counters.  If wrong, steal 1 Terribleness counter, you win.


1 counter: remove a C/E/B and gain 3 counters; remove all three and you die.

Terribleness with 0 counters is removed.

Game ends when someone dies, or three Terribleness are removed.  Clockwise, acknowledge how one Terribleness became part of you.  If any Terribleness has >5 counters, describe the village’s destruction.
```
<hr> 

## Jury Duty

```
You are members of a jury. Vote to choose a Foreman - they will speak first and read the record. The Foreman starts by reminding everyone of the defendant's name and alleged crime.

Everyone then takes a turn reminding the other jurors of a fact from the trial. State your fact and roll 2d6.

On a 10+, your fact is part of the record. Write it down.

On a 7-9, write it down and choose one:

*The judge instructed jurors to ignore it – tell us why and cross it out.

*You forgot an important detail – the juror to your left adds the extra detail to the record.

*There was contradictory evidence offered by the other side – the juror to your right explains and writes it down.

On a 6-, write it down and then the jurors on your right and left each choose one of the above.

After every juror has had a turn, the first to speak reads the record and everyone votes - Guilty or Not Guilty. A unanimous vote is required for a decision. If a vote isn't decisive, begin a new round. After the third round, if there is no decision, the jury is hung.
```
<hr> 

## THINGS BEYOND

```
The religions of the world protect humanity from extradimensional horrors with their rituals, ceremonies, and secret societies. Their conflicts are a result of our lost perspective on the THINGS BEYOND, and True Heretics seek this chaos to invite the THINGS BEYOND.

True faith is a powerful force that blocks out more sinister feelings; The feeling of being watched, the feeling of unease at being alone, paranoia, and insanity are simply the symptoms of a much darker manifestation.

You are a SHIELD OF FAITH. Your reasons are between you and the THINGS BEYOND, but you are protecting humanity; your job is to 	WITNESS, SEAL, and RESTORE.

WITNESSING means seeing, and surviving the Things Beyond.

SEALING means hiding, closing, or destroying a conduit to the Things Beyond.

RESTORING means an act kindness, a reparation, or a soul journey.

Any time you RESTORE, SEAL, or WITNESS, you gain either POWER or INSIGHT.

POWER is a temporary boon and is physical, mental, or magical; strength, stroke of genius, or magic.

INSIGHT is permanent knowledge from Things Beyond; INSIGHT is often needed to fight THINGS BEYOND.

For when an outcome isn't apparent, roll 2d6. <6 fails with consequences, 7-10 succeeds with consequences, 11-12 succeeds resoundingly.

## Hotfix

```
You're a team of mechanics, trying to nurse a dying vessel to safety. Work together, and work fast.

Each player maintains a system. Write its name, say why it's important, address each other by system. Systems start at stage 3, which is stable. 5 is optimal, 1 is critical. Track stages on fingers, where everyone can see. 
Oldest player goes first. On your turn, you may Repair, Maintain, or Operate. Roll six-sided die. Call on the next player, clockwise.

Narrate your actions, repairs or errors. If you helped others, say how. If you screwed over a teammate, they describe how.

Operate: on 4+, everyone gets +1 to rolls until your next turn.

Maintain: on 3+, gain one stage, you’re treading water.

Repair: on 5-6, gain two stages. On 2-4, you may gain a stage, and choose a teammate who loses one. On 1, lose a stage. At stage 0, you may only Repair.

At the end of a round, every system degrades one stage. If a system hits stage 0, EVERY other system is damaged one stage. If only one system's left, your crew is lost. If you survive six rounds, you reach safety.
```
<hr> 

## Encounters

```
For two to four players
Each player chooses a unique symbol. Place that symbol on three index cards. Shuffle all cards together to form encounter deck.
Each player describes a hero. Put their name on a card.

## Sentence Dungeon

```
Your group is about enter a dungeon. One person is the GM, and the rest make characters by assigning the numbers 6, 4 and 2 to Strength, Sorcery and Secrecy and picking one weapon and one trinket for gear. Actions are resolved by successfully rolling a d6 under your stat. (NPCs have 3's in all their stats.) Characters may be wounded three times in a single battle before they are knocked unconscious.

To stock the dungeon, the GM flips to a random page of the nearest book. The first complete sentence on that page is your dungeon for this adventure. Use the following procedure:

1. Vowels represent a new room. Multiple vowels in a row is a hallway.

2. Consonants are room features. Convert the consonant into a number from 1-26, and consult the chart below (for two digit numbers, add the digits together so you have one digit):

Dungeon Contents
1-6 – A monster (d6: 1-2 orc, 3-4 elemental, 5 dragon, 6 demon) guarding (d6: 1-3 nothing, 4-6 treasure.)
7-8 – A trap (d6: 1-2 arrows, 3-4 magic fire, 5-6 pit)
9 – Special (d6: 1-2 wishing well, 3-4 a chained prisoner, 5-6 talking statue)
```
<hr> 

## Knock

```
For 3 or more players.

“Knock knock.” Knock twice on a surface to start a scene.

“Who’s there?” Another player responds. They will also be in the scene.

“Interrupting cow.” Introduce yourself by name or title.

“Interrupting cow who?” The other player responds.

“Interrupting cow, who just lost the companion most dear to my heart.” Repeat your name or title, and then add a detail about yourself: what has brought you this place, what you are feeling, what you aspire to, and so forth. Write this information down.

Converse briefly in character. The scene ends when another player knocks twice to begin a new scene. One player in the current scene must respond in character; the other is no longer in the scene and their character becomes available.

When you begin a new scene, select an available character or introduce a new one. All characters exist in the same narrative space.

When introducing a scene with a character that has appeared before, ask what, when, where, why, or how. Only ask each question of a character once. When one character’s sheet has answers to all six questions, finish the current scene, then end the game.
```
<hr> 

## Queen_killer

```
The queen is dead. One of us killed her.
Her crown is unclaimed. One of us is worthy.

The object is to make a mess: fight our friends, fall in love with our enemies.

We each also have a secret object. Choose:
- become ruler
- survive
- earn ___’s love
- avenge ___
- support ___
- see ___ slain
Change this anytime.

Name yourself.

Say what you find attractive about the character to your left.

Say what you despise about the character to THEIR left.

Deal a face-down card for each player, all clubs except one spade – the queen-killer. Look at yours now; never again.

Deal another, all diamonds except one heart – the crown-worthy. Never look.

You can: 
- Say or act out what you do (not what happens)
- Ask a player a question
- Answer a question with anything (except another’s actions or beliefs)

If you share a kiss, look at each other’s cards.

If you attempt murder, they choose: 
- give you what you want
- toss a coin; the loser dies

If you touch the crown, reveal your red card. The unworthy die.

Light a candle. The game ends when the living recognize a ruler, or the flame dies and us with it.

## On Divining Oneirography

```
Dearest Friend,

There are men after me. They have been watching me for some time. I haven’t much time to write these instructions, so please forgive the erratic nature of my handscript. I shall send you a clue to my whereabouts, but it must be encoded and obscured by esoteric means. What good fortune that there are those amongst you with the ability to decipher my message!

Have your oneirographist lie down upon a chaise longue. She must close her eyes and prepare her spirit for transsomatic travel. Provide her with a colored drawing utensil and place a sheet of white paper beneath her wrist. She must clear her mind of all distraction. As she drifts into a meditative state, her hand will begin to move in a swirling scribbling dance. Truly, the drawing of dreams is a beautiful thing to behold.

When thirty seconds have passed, wake the dreamer from her trance. Instruct your medium to take a black pen, and, with guidance from the spirits, interpret the image embedded within the astral abstraction by tracing the meaningful patterns within. With this, my location should become clear. I beseech you, make great haste!

With Sincere Regard, your ally Maylisbeth

## So...here is the scenario...

```
This is a game for four to five and one DM the DM pitches a scenario  and gives form to the setting and situation. The players then roll dice and highest begins taking place in the scene as a character. Play goes round table the next person takes over DM duties making sure to complete these task during play as more people take over everyone stays in the scene and things grow more interesting.

1. Move forward - This can be anything not just "moving" but they must make forward motion in some way in the scene.

2. Act upon the setting and find an impedance.

3. Find or introduce a new aspect that might help the situation

4. Act towards your next action and pass the narrative while introducing yourself as a character.

And then as the first player passes  the next DM takes control each round should be about 10-12 minutes once every player has gone once the first DM sets up the finish.During which the group goes one more time around as the players work together to end the scenario. 
```
<hr> 

## #Resist

```
Everyone chooses a different type of Resister made up of an adjective/noun combination, such as Veteran Activist, Socialist Politician, Social Media Warrior, or Newly Woke.

Choose one player to start as the Mouthpiece. Instead of playing her Resister this round, the Mouthpiece invents an Order: some harmful law, executive order, or other legislation. The Mouthpiece can announce the Order as she likes, such as a line from a bill, a quote from the Press Secretary, or a tweet from the President.

Then, each Resister states what their character would do to oppose the Order.

Next, the Resisters state what their character would do to conflict with the stated efforts of one other Resister. This conflict could be spun as intentional or unintentional.

Finally, the Mouthpiece states which Resister's action stymied, impeded, or annoyed the Administration the most. Similar to the Order announcement, this response might come as a pundit's rant, a midnight tweet, or an SNL parody.

Continue play for a predetermined number of rounds (switching the Mouthpiece role each round). The winner is the player with the most successful resistance.

Alternatively, the game may end when a simple majority of players agree that we are all screwed.

Queen=Shaman. Healing. Draw Mental card for healing value. Can add Determination draw.
Jack=Matron. Child on back. Can't be surprised. Add 1 damage to each successful attack from kid attack.

Non-trivial actions are difficulty value 3-10+. If against creatures, difficulty equals attribute. A card is drawn from appropriate stack for the value of attempt. Success is value equal or above difficulty. Attempts may be boosted once with card from Determination stack. Add values of two cards. Drawn cards go to used piles.
Combat: Clubs for melee. Diamonds for ranged. Damage by Physical attribute plus weapon bonus. Coordination equals difficulty to hit.
One hour rest restores one random used card to each suit pile, except Determination. Determination refreshed between sessions.

## VOICE

```
Silence.

Start with several stones. These are gifts.
Gods gather, with complete control over It. Nothing else.
Gods will give gifts to It.

One of you plays It. Close your eyes, for It cannot see. The Gods have not gifted It SIGHT. But the Gods might. 

The rest are Gods.

A God gives a gift. The first gift must be VOICE or SOUND. Give It a stone.

-VOICE: What does It say? No one will answer It. It is alone. (It may speak; the Gods may not.)
 or
-SOUND: What does It hear? It cannot answer. (The Gods may speak; It may not.)

Give more gifts; explore these gifts. Use logic: if the Gods gift TOUCH, It may feel. What does It feel? A network of sensors? One organic body?

Remember, It describes what It experiences, not the Gods. The Gods only discuss with It (given VOICE + SOUND). Compare themselves to It. The Gods may only explore their world through their gifts to It.

Do the Gods gift It:
-IDENTITY? It becomes Them.
-LOVE? Does It love the Gods?
-SIGHT? What does It see? Monsters? Machines? Mortals?

The Gods can gift It anything.

Play until all gifts are given.

## Indivisible: An Empathic Game for Two

```
Message a real-life friend the following invitation, suggesting characters somehow dissimilar to your actual selves (go wild!): 
  --“We are indivisible: I’m a --. You’re a --.” (“I’m an overcompensating, middle-school birdgirl. You’re an introspective classmate attracted to me.”)

Then offer the first prompt. All prompts have three parts:
  --Current internal, emotional experience: “I feel --”
  --Resulting visible external behavior: “You see me --”
  --One leading question, maybe introducing improbable hope or probable fear.
  (“I feel tired of restraining my temper. You see me clearing tear-stains before class. Why aren’t you prepared for our test today?”)

Take turns providing prompts, describing scene details as needed. Answer leading questions if you wish. Include words from previous prompts wherever possible (especially identities, motives, and doubts).

Play until someone ends a prompt with the following closing question, (you may replace “me” with any specific real person’s name):
  --“What attractive quality or potential in real-life me do you see afresh through this tale?” 
Answer this question by affirming your friend using a specific, real-life example of a time you saw the other exemplify that quality. Then ask back.

After you both ask and answer this question once, say only “Thank you friend” before going about your indivisible lives.

## Paintball, the RPG

```
The game takes place in any possible scenery and point in time. It requires a minimum of 3 players, one of which is the guide. Can be co-op (players against NPCs) or PvP. Guide adds NPCs as required.
Players start with 100 hit points. When reaching 0 they are out.

Objective: eliminate the opposite team.

Mechanics:
1d10 for failure/success. 1, 2, 3 are failures. 4 to 10 are successes. The higher the best hit. 10 grants +2 bonus.
2d6 for damage taken/received.

The guide decides bonuses, penalties and hit based on the characters, their professions and background (special forces, soldier, police, medic…) given by the players.
Players narrate the encounter based on what the guide decided.

Weapons (damage is 2d6 +/- reported bonus):
Handguns: +3 from 10 to 25 meters. +4 close. -1 for every 5 meters after 26.
Shotguns: +5 from close. -1 for every 3 meters after 10.
Sniper rifle: +10 if expert. -5 if not. Not used in close combat.
Hands: +2. +5 if expert. -1 if upper body hit.

Guide decides what part of the body is hit.
Players describe tactics taken to win, combat options and anything compelling to the story.

## Parasite Vector

```
You are bio-commandos infiltrating the Machine-Monk’s temple to rescue your legion’s War-Womb.

Objectives:
Deny them the war-womb.
Recover the war-womb.
Destroy the temple.

One player’s the Machine-Master, controlling the temple’s defences. Roll on both three times:

Unaugmented
Flesh-and-metal
Mind-slaving
Auto-evolving
Virtual
Mecha

Knights
Hunters
Labyrinths
Engineers
Armouries
Bishops

Baseline humans have no chance. You have certain advantages:

Your Mutations:
4 ganglia: Sever 1 to hypnotise, scry, hack.
Roll [ganglia]d6s to sense environments/coerce others.

4 digits: Sever 1 to fire a burrowing projectile. 
Roll [digits]d6s to use dexterity/precision.

4 blood: Spend 1 to heal mortal wounds/get +1d6.
Roll [blood]d6s to understand/resculpt flesh.

4 limbs: Sever 1 to make an explosive. 
Roll [limbs]d6s to use speed/force.

When rolling take the highest:
6:	Success. Give next commando to roll +1d6.
4-5:	Success. You’re drained/vulnerable.
1-3:	Failure. Reinforcements arrive/you take a mortal wound.
At 0d6 roll 2d6, pick lowest.

Machine-Master: say the Temple’s response, gives another commando a threat or opportunity, and ask what they do.

When you salvage Machine-Monk flesh, restore 1 to a mutation but mark 1:
You can’t hear the squad’s thoughts.
You’ll reject further salvage.
The machinery is beautiful.

## Ex Libro

```
In Ex Libro, players choose characters from novels, trying to find objects or characters held in another book. That other book, the setting, is controlled by the gamemaster.

Preparation: Choose a book ≈300 pages*.

Gamemaster: Read through your chosen book, flagging locations, scenes, characters. Tell the players your book. Create or find any helpful supplements (maps, etc). Choose an object or character from each player’s book to rescue. Identify where in your book these are located.

Players: Read through your chosen book, flagging helpful actions and reactions of your character. Tell the gamemaster your book and character.

Gameplay: The Gamemaster runs characters through the GM’s novel, roleplaying the setting, NPCs, etc. The players roleplay their character. Players choose lines from their novel to resolve conflicts. Once a line is quoted, it cannot be reused, and you cannot choose lines from earlier pages. Characters vanish and return to their novels if they get their quested object, die, or run out of pages. 

*For every 50 pages over, players may not use lines from the first 25. For every 50 pages under, they may at any point jump back 25 pages to choose lines, but they still can’t reuse any lines.

## Human Or Not, Here I Am

```
Future Earth humans and replicants live in peace, but two species are warring with us. One destroys humans, the other non “true-bios”. One of their Inquisitors has captured you for questioning...but you don't know which one.

All players comprise a single Entity, hiding its nature.

Write “human” and “non-human” on paper slips for each player.

Fold and mix slips. Take one, your secret role.

For even numbers, take one extra and set aside.

On new slips, each player writes a personality aspect. Mix slips and take one, your secret aspect.

On final slips, write “humans die”/“non-humans die” (Inquisitor’s agenda). Mix, pick one. Don't look.

Take turns as Inquisitor, asking questions to determine Entity’s humanity.

Ask someone you haven't questioned something that:
...is not directly about role/aspect
...doesn’t repeat another question
...is open-ended

Answer keeping your aspect in mind, hiding your role. Build on answers from other players.

Once everyone has asked everyone else questions, answer the final question together. Is Entity human? Discuss and vote.

Reveal hidden agenda. Did Entity survive?

Reveal roles. Majority determines Entity's humanity. Use the role set aside to break ties.

Was the Inquisitor right? Which side “winning” is winning?
```
<hr> 

## Micro Kittens

```
3-5 players

You are a kitten who wants to get adopted from the Humane Society. Pick a description of why you should be adopted (fluffy, cuddly, playful, tiny, polydactyl) and a description of why you haven’t been adopted yet (dirty, skittish, old, aggressive, sick).

Roll 5d6. Keep them -- this is your pool.

Pick someone to be the active player. When you’re the active player, frame a scene in which you act. Other players portray other characters in the scene.

When you do something ADORABLE in one of the categories below, place a die next to it, as long as it’s different in number from the other dice already there. If you act according to one of your descriptions in this scene, you may re-roll one die from your pool before selecting one to place.

MESSY

ADVENTURE

AFFECTION

MEOWS

The player to your right invents a complication based on your die’s number as follows:

1: Someone gets hurt
2: Someone gets in trouble
3: Something gets lost
4: Something breaks
5: Someone new arrives
6: Something brings bad news

The player to your left now becomes the active player.

When you have done four adorable things, tell who adopted you.

## Duet

```
You need another person, a six-sided die, paper, fifteen tokens, and a pencil.

Write this down.

“I remember when...
We first met
I made a mistake
I thought I lost them
I told the truth
I forgave them
It ended”

Your true love was taken into Darkness. They are the Lost. They take five tokens.
They call to you, the Seeker. Take ten tokens.


When you go into Darkness, you remember. Roll the die, then say

“I felt…”
1. Crushed
2. Depressed
3. Infuriated
4. Peaceful
5. Inspired
6. Loved

Say where it started, then ask how. They answer, then ask you a question. Choose.

"I remember." Place a token, then answer. Ask them a question, they have the same choice.

"I don't remember." Take all tokens placed, erase the memory, and the Seeker goes into Darkness.

You only remember what isn't erased.

The game ends when either all memories are erased, or someone has no tokens

Don't continue reading until your game ends...

If the Seeker or the Lost have more tokens than the other, only they find their way out of Darkness.

If the Seeker and the Lost have the same number of tokens, they find each other.

## What The #@*$ Happened Last Night?

```
A modern urban storytelling game for 3 to 6 players.

* Choose a group bond: College buddies? Coworkers? Extended family?

* Agree on tone: Surreal? Gritty? Wacky? This matters!

* Everyone wakes up in a daze after a crazy night out.

* “Where are we?” Jail cell? Hotel suite? Stranger’s house? 

* Each player gets 10 poker chips representing memory blocks. 

* The player who vomited most recently starts.

"WHAT THE #@*$ HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?"

* Take turns piecing together your experiences. Figure out the sequence of events, in reverse chronological order.

~ "Last thing I remember we..."
~ "Oh! And before that we..."

* Every scenario should be 2 or 3 sentences featuring a particular event, person, location, or thing.

* Each scenario removes one memory block.

* A player's turn ends when…

~ They lag 5 seconds between scenarios.
~ Their scenario is too far-fetched for the current narrative - others call bullshit!

* That player adds one memory block and the next player takes over.

* The game ends when a player loses all their memory blocks - they remember how the night actually began!

* Optional: "Who's calling?" When a player first reaches 5 memory blocks, someone calls their mobile phone. Roll 1d6.

6 - Pimp
5 - Priest
4 - Dealer
3 - Stripper
2 - Officer
1 - Gangster

## Don’t lose your marbles

```
You need a jar full of marbles and a couple of friends to play this game. Choose one person to be the narrator of the first scene. This role is rotated across the table. Each person should be the narrator for one scene, and then pass the torch to another player.

Discuss the type of story you want to tell together. Each player creates a character and tells their story to the others. The other players add one detail each to the character’s story and associate to that detail a number of marbles that character will starts with.

Whenever something disturbing happens to your character, the narrator gives you one or more marbles. You have to hold your marbles with a single hand (or on a small cup). When you cannot hold more marbles, your character goes insane. Tell to the other players how the current event drove you to madness.

Suggestions for the number of marbles one should get when:

Seeing a dead body: 1 - 3 marbles, depending on how well you know the person
Watching a murder happen: 3 - 5 marbles, ditto
Learning about unspeakable things: 3 - 10 marbles
Seeing or doing an unspeakable thing: 5 - 15 marbles
```
<hr> 

## [REDACTED]

```
[REDACTED] is a Cold War espionage game. 

Each player has a dossier, initially with one page of a memo or a personnel file about their agent. 

To take an action, roll 1d6: 
Five or less and Control says what happened. 
Six, seven, or eight and the player says what happened, but Control may add a twist.
Nine or more and the player says what happened.

You can add dice by redacting words from your dossier. Redacting one phrase that applies to your current situation grants you an additional d6. Unrelated words grant you +1 per word.

Example: A sentence reads "Seth Taylor, 5' 3", was arrested on June 14, 1985, breaking into Masters Electronics on Fry Street." If there is a part of the game where it is beneficial to be small, redact the height, and now roll 2d6. Infiltrating a building? redact "breaking into" and "Fry Street" to roll three dice. Knock out a guard? Redact "1985" to gain +1 on the roll.

After the mission, write up a new sheet for your dossier. You can redact from the new sheet normally, but older sheets need one additional word redacted for each page further back in the dossier.﻿

## Cat Wrangling

```
Cat Wranglers earn experience gathering cats into their herd.

Start with 2d6 cats and one method. Each turn there will be 1d6 new cats in your neighborhood, and 2d6 cats attempting to escape.

Both ancient methods and new methods are used.

Ancient methods include fresh fish, canned fish, caged canaries, and catnip. Cats may be strays, or those stuck in trees. Each method attracts 1d6 cats.

New methods must be researched to maximize one's herd. Possible new methods are: cat yodeling, cat calling, breeding Andalusian catherd dogs, etc.

Developing new methods are adjudicated by the judge with a difficulty level. Any creative and entertaining method is permitted.

Enticements for cats to leave the herd must be negated. Threats include: big mama cat or old Tom on the prowl and frisky, mice on the periphery of the herd, song birds in the forest too near the ground, children with a laser pointer, stray dogs running wild, etc.

The health of your heard must be maintained by cleaning the litter boxes and feeding the herd.

Tick marks keep track of cats, food, and litter. Starting methods on index cards are assigned randomly.

Each dozen cats attracts a helper and gains a level.
```

## The Places Where I Found You

```
Tools: Pencil and paper. 

Roles: The House (mute). The Ghost. The Child. The Diary. 

Players: 4. Combine The Child and Diary roles to play with 3, and The House and Ghost to play with 2. 

1. In silence, The House begins drawing a location - such as a house, room, or outdoor setting - on a piece of paper. The Ghost interprets the image and answers questions from The Child and Diary about the location while The House draws.

2. The Diary narrates an average day from The Child's past set in the sketched location. The House illustrates the setting with features from The Diary's story, until the The Ghost interrupts. 

3. The Ghost creates a Haunted Object, which The House draws, and recounts The Child's monstrous or unsettling encounter with the object.

4. The Child responds with a positive memory or fantasy about the location or Haunted Object, and crumples up the page. 

Repeat Steps 1 through 4 two more times.  

5. The Ghost chooses one of the crumpled pages at random. They reveal The Ghost's origin or first manifestation in that location.

6. The Child takes another crumpled page and describes their final encounter with The Ghost in that location.

## Backpackers

```
Backpackers:
    Modern day adventure-travellers meet, share stories, and hookup.

You all come from a different place. (Make a passport.)
You’ve all arrived at the same destination. (Stamp your passport.)
You’ve shared an interesting, new experience. 
    (scuba, surfing, climbing, riding, archaeology, festival, whatever)
Now, you’re at the afterparty...

Together, in conversation, describe your experiences.
    “I loved it when…”
    “That was so funny when…”
    “Did you see the … ?”

Don’t take orderly turns. Instead, jump in anytime and riff. 
    Say “OMG YES! And then...!”.

You’re getting to know each other. Ask questions. Who are they, where do they come from, what’s it like there, how did they afford the trip, how do they feel about important issues, etc?

At any point, you may offer to “hookup” with someone. Invite them to join you on your next trip to (where?).

If they agree, the conversation moves to the next afterparty in the new destination. Stamp your passports. Other players may bring their current characters or create new ones.


Why play Backpackers? 

    It’s fun travelling, meeting new people, sharing experiences, and collecting passport stamps.
    It may be interesting to explore notions of privilege, entitlement, cultural stereotypes, infatuation, jealousy, etc.

## Tiny Tribe

```
The players are leaders of a 100 tiny person tribe trying to survive in a suburban home. They may be fragile and an inch tall, but each one is absolutely devoted to their leaders.

Pregame
GM / leaders decide on goals like “Drink Milk” or “Make Fire” that the leaders must guide their tribe to complete.

Conflict Resolution (CR)
1. GM chooses dice based on difficulty and risk
2. Leaders assign a number of tribesman to the job
  a. Moving tribesmen over gaps or vertically necessitates assigning as many tribesmen as the leaders want to move, moving more tribesmen may be more risky
3. The number rolled is the number of assigned tribesmen who died in service
4. At least one tribesman must survive for success
5. If the lowest possible number is rolled everyone survives

After CR1 a leader can choose to complete the task themselves. This guarantees success but will always kill the leader, who must now lead from beyond the grave as a ghost!

Objects can be carried. After CR1 the leaders may describe how to use an object to complete a task. The GM gives a number between zero and infinity to be subtracted from the roll.

## Wilder

```
Three to four people outline a wilderness setting (mountaintop, desert, ...); name the recurring Challenge against your return home (wildlife, weather, ...). Everyone says who they’re portraying and chooses +1 to act rashly, help others, or use wits. One player narrates the scene of how your characters became stranded in this wilderness.

Write down three obstacles (trapped, starvation, ...) against which the characters work to return to civilisation; set them out on the table. In a hat, everyone places three Tickets with narrative elements (cabin, gunfire, ...) written on them. Keep the challenge in mind.

Choose one player to be the Guide, who picks an obstacle and draws a ticket, narrating scenes to include them. Other players say what their characters do; some draw tickets to use in their descriptions.

When players try something risky or dangerous, roll a dice. 4+ is good, 3- isn’t; the guide says how.

After three tickets are used, if the obstacle hasn’t been overcome, the guide narrates it’s resolution, good or bad.

After an obstacle is resolved another player volunteers to be the new guide and picks a new obstacle. For the last obstacle, the guides says how overcoming it takes you home.

## Lovecraft Lightest

```
Character Creation: Roll 4d4 for stat points and distribute them between BODY and MIND to a minimum of 2 and maximum of 8. These are all the stats characters have. Players have 4 item slots and 1 weapon slot and can add anything to those slots with GM’s discretion during character creation. Ammunition needed for a weapon uses an item slot. 

How to play: When a player wishes to take an action that player rolls a d12 against a stat the GM calls for. On a result less than the character's stat is rolled, the attempt is a success. On a result equal or greater than the stat, an additional point is added to the stat. Once either stat reaches 11 points, the character dies.

Sanity: When a character sees something their mind may not comprehend, a GM may call for a sanity check where a player rolls 1d10 and must roll higher than their MIND stat or add 1 point to that stat.

Damage:When a character takes damage, a GM may call for a Damage check where a player rolls 1d10 and must roll higher than their BODY stat or add 1 point to that stat.

          Find other Olympians. Absorb their divinity through pleading, coercion, deception, or violence.

Rules:
- Player can always sense the direction (but not identity) of the nearest Olympian.
- Olympians cannot die or fade away before losing their divinity. “Killed” Olympians revive unscathed within one hour.
- Divinity cannot be absorbed from unwilling Olympians unless they’re unconscious. 
- Absorbing an Olympian’s divinity adds its portfolios to player’s own. 
- Resolve magical challenges by rolling 1d6 for ancient portfolios or 2d6 for modern portfolios.
- Resolve mundane physical, mental and social challenges by rolling 1d6.  Add +1 per applicable - ancient portfolio; add +2 per applicable modern portfolio.
- Rolls succeed on results ≥ 5.
- If portfolio(s) were applied to mundane rolls, player narrates success / failure. Otherwise, GM narrates success / failure.

## Space travel with babies

```
Up to five adults and babies.

Space is big: hundreds of colonised worlds. Technology, culture and law vary.

FTL travel uses 'jump pods’, traveling between gates. Journeys take 1-5 hours, connecting with many worlds and gates at each end.

**Play**
The game is one jump journey. Agree how long the journey will be, set a timer; when it goes off, the journey ends.

The room you are in, plus bathroom and kitchen, is your jump pod. 

Children play themselves; actions relating to them are in character. 

Play begins when you enter the pod as strangers, stuck in this space with children; your only entertainment is talking. Start with small talk, but progress to learning about each other.

**Character generation**
* Where are you travelling from/to?
* Why? 
* Did anyone see you off?
* Is anyone meeting you?
* One-way or return trip? 
* Have you been there before? 

**Tips**
* Look for similarities and differences between you.
* Make things up about your journey, destination, family as you go along 
* Talk about the children: ages, activities, preferences, abilities. 
* Think about how children learn social rules, and have leeway in breaking them; what are they doing which will be trained out of them later?

## Oathbreakers: Deviant Warlocks

```
Gather three tokens per person.

Each person states a long-standing norm. When the last person finishes, they also declare how their Oathbreaker broke a stated norm. Then they decide their name and one or two powers. Each person follow suit, then a candle is lit.

During the following scenes, an Oathbreaker may use an owned power. If used to benefit another Oathbreaker, the player gives a token to that favored player. If used to benefit a non-deviant, the player removes the token from play. If used to benefit themselves, the player keeps the token. If you have no tokens but use a power, take another's, then cast it away forever.

First, play to answer: In what ways is our deviant enclave home, even when other deviants threaten it? Once answered, someone extinguishes the candle.

After time, another candle is lit. Next, play to answer: Why does greater society and its oaths still challenge our lives on the periphery? Once answered, someone extinguishes the candle.

After some time, a final candle is lit. Lastly, play to answer: How do we tangle our lives with non-deviants? Once answered, someone extinguishes the final candle.

Examine how the remaining tokens spell each Oathbreaker’s fate.

## Go North

```
GO NORTH
An improv RPG in the style of classic text adventures

ROLES
- 1 GM
- Players, usually just 1 main player, who control a single character

RULES
Players alternate with the GM stating an action, and the GM stating a result. Actions must be kept simple– a single verb and object, possible with simple clarification For example, “Go North,” “Check Inventory,” “Place key in lock.” The GM will then respond with the result of that action in a few sentences. Everything else is completely up to the discretion and imagination of the GM– the game is completely freeform and improvisational, including where the adventure takes place, starting inventory, etc. In general the GM only thinks a few steps ahead, giving the result of individual player actions; there’s no larger plot or story.

If playing with multiple players, they share control of a single character.

While players are free to try anything they want, typical verbs include “go <direction>”, “examine <object>”, “check inventory,” “use <object>,” “look at <anything>,” and so on.

Traditionally, the player’s first action is always “Go North”

## No set.

```
Meditate on this moment.

Then gather four of your dearest friends. 
Hand them each pens, papers, three envelopes. 
Ask them each to imagine a character. A Persona.  
There are no limits or set setting. Anything they fancy beautiful, interesting or worth exploring will do just fine.
Ask them to describe the race of their characters. Its appearance, traditions, and the history of its ancestors. They are to describe it all in paper, and save each paper in a different envelope. 
The second envelope is for the profession, skills and possessions of their characters. 
The last envelope is for the personalities, tastes, mannerisms, fears, weaknesses.
Remind them that each of the descriptions should be beautiful in itself and self-sufficient. And that if one of the three facets needs the others to exist, they probably don’t have a very interesting character.  Remind them that they themselves are not their nationality, jobs or moods.

Before starting to play, shuffle and deal the envelopes. 
Each player will now have a character made with the ideas of their friends, none of the ideas of their own. Ask them to roleplay earnestly. 

The mechanics and dice-throwing are left for you to decide, as they are secondary.

## Reign over Hell

```
You are Devils, Squabbling over Hell.

Choose some adversaries, 3 candles each, and writing implements.

Declare a True Name, your twisted Form and the three Greatest Playthings under your Dominion. Each lights 3 Candles to represent these.

Form a Circle. Inscribe a Glyph by marking a Line connecting each Devil. Starting with the Greatest among you and cycling leftwards, a Devil names another Devil. They both write either Contempt or Wrath on a scrap of paper, then reveal what was written.

If One declares Wrath, they take a Plaything from the other, who states how.

If both declare Wrath, Each Devil loses a Plaything. They both describe how they destroyed the other's Playthings.

If both have written Contempt, each restores a lost Domain.

If none declare Wrath in a full rotation of the Circle, the conflict subsides, and the Devil with the most Playthings reigns Supreme.

If a Devil ever has more than Five Playthings, one Rebels and is destroyed. Describe why.

If a Devil has no Playthings, his last Hope is begging the Heavens for forgiveness before being torn asunder by lost souls. Either Pray for Salvation, or Spite Him one last time. He will Accept, either way.

## The Victory Circle; A Nano-Larp

```
Stand in a corner and say: “Rhode Island. July, 1676. We’re English farmers who have been at war with the Wampanoag Sachem Metacom. Some have lost everything. With our native allies the Mohegan, we’ve captured 40 of Metacom’s warriors. The Mohegan are uneasy. They desire a captive. We are reluctant to disoblige our allies.” 
Decide together: Give them a man who boasted of killing nineteen Englishmen [go to 1] or refuse [go to 3].

[1] Say: “They form a jubilant circle and hack off the warrior’s toes”. 
Stop the torture [3] or step forward and be complicit [4].

[2] Say: “The Mohegan invite us to bash in his skull to revenge ourselves.”
Swing your clubs [5] or decline [7].

[3] Say: “The Mohegan furiously break their alliance and join Metacom’s confederacy. We’ve doomed the New England colonies.”
END

[4] Say: “The Mohegan make him dance and then sever his fingers.” 
Stop them [3] or join the circle [6].

[5] Say: “We beat the captive to death.”

## Cops

```
You are a police officer who work on the streets. You fight the crime: violence, burglary, murder, drugs, etc. You always work with a partner(another player). If there an even number of players, than one player is working undercover.
One player is the Crimelord, which is going to throw shit at the characters’ lives. Under charged situations they can ask for a roll to see if players succeed. Players start with 3d6, and need 4 or higher on 2 dice. If players fail, they can turn it into a success by adding stress dice (3 minus total of success; use a different colour dice). When partners work together, both receive an extra dice.
Success granted by stress dice or when players add them allow the Crimelord to create a complication. The more stress dice, the tougher is the complication.
Each player has one trait. They need to choose one word that describe something their character is good at. When the trait applies they have an extra die.
Remove 1 stress dice at the begging of each session and when players do something to relax. The Crimelord can remove a stress dice to throw a complication anytime.

## Five Cards

```
Referee designs adventure. Challenges defined in terms of the number of success needed to overcome them.

Players get 10 cards. 5 Action Cards:

Success with complication
Complete success
Failure with benefit
Complete failure
Standoff

And 5 blank Character Cards. They define their Character by writing 5 things on them. 

Referee gets 5 cards:

Referee claims card
Player retains card
Card goes to another Player
Card discarded
Player vote

Referee describes the setting. Players state actions. When Characters face a challenge, player draws random Action Card. Results interpreted by Referee. Failure may cause wound - turn a Character Card over. Successes/benefits may heal wounds.

Referee draws a random Referee Card to determine what happens to the player's Action Card. The Referee can take no proactive actions until they have gained at least one action card. They then have two piles of cards.

Player and the Referee shuffle their card piles. Action moves to next Player.

If a Player has no Action Cards and their Character has a wound, they are dead. 

Play continues until the adventure is over or all Action Cards are discarded.

## Unknown Kingdoms: The Footsteps of Marco Polo

```
Renowned traveller Marco Polo has disappeared. Hearing legends of lands he visited, a band of curious Venetians sets out to document these strange kingdoms, befriend their rulers in the name of Venice, and perhaps find the lost explorer.
 
2d6
Deck of cards spread face down in a grid to form the landscape.
 
Red cards: wilderness. Mountains, deserts, seas...
Clubs: cities.
Spades: special settlements. Monasteries, pirate hideouts, ancient ruins…
Jokers: mysteries. Ghost-towns, tombs, hidden temples…
 
Face-cards follow their suit and indicate a remarkable person present – mighty king, reclusive sage, legendary thief, infamous villain…
 
The first player selects a card from one of the grid’s edges to reveal. They get to describe the place and any distinctive features (culture, diplomatic relations…).
 
Actions:
Reveal and describe a card adjacent to any upturned card.
‘Interact’ with an upturned card (discover clues, befriend populace, buy boat…): declare intention and roll 2d6. If the result equals/betters the card’s number, you succeed. Relevant interactions from earlier in the game give +2 bonuses (necessary for king-cards). For failures, another player describes what happens. For face-cards, another player describes the NPC’s reaction (strike bargain, ask for a favour…).
 
Take turns to act. Explore these strange lands together.

## Girls from Gilmore, Boys from the Dwarf

```
Inspired by tv shows such as Gilmore Girls and Red Dwarf, this game supports linked-session play focused on enduring yet difficult relationships.
Setup
Agree a setting with several characters who cannot abandon one another (isolation, strong family ties, blood oaths, business contracts, dependencies etc).
Brainstorm a number of disagreements that could permanently damage their relationships ('wedges').
For each relationship between two characters, agree one wedge that occurred in the past that was never fully resolved (their 'backstory'). Backstories can be referenced in play, but are never the primary focus.
Play
To begin play, select one relationship (and only one) and agree a wedge that will impact it.
Each wedge is explored in 3 scenes that must include the two characters.
1 Introduction
2 Escalation
3 Ultimatum
In between these scenes must be one or more side-scenes with one of the impacted characters but not the other.
After the Ultimatum scene, the impacted players agree whether their characters will fully reconcile or not. If so, remove the wedge. If not, add it to their backstory. Backstories are never removed.
Continue play by selecting a different relationship and agreeing a wedge, then following the same process.
Brainstorm new wedges when needed.

## Thank you for the feast

```
Sit down for dinner with your close friends. You are very important people at a fancy dinner. Before you begin eating, name yourself, your title and what you’ve done to further your political career. Explain your connection to two other guests and build the story of your careers together. Each dinner guest receives two poison tokens which they keep under their napkin. Every guest closes their eyes in turn and players secretly place tokens in front of their plates. Guests can be poisoned multiple times. Not all tokens must be used.

Have your meal and enjoy the time spent with your friends.

At the end of the meal, take turns to accuse your fellow guests of poisoning you with your dying breath. You have one guess per token. If you’re correct, the guest will say “and I did it all because…” and explain their motive. You survive that poisoning attempt and move on to the next token.

If you’re dying of poison you must still answer accusations. 

At the end of the meal, if you’re alive rise from the table, thank your guests and clear the table. You look forward to the next dinner party with your dearest friends.

## Nakama: A Card Game of Magical Girls

```
Five players, two decks of cards (no jokers.)

Four players are a magical girl team; Princess Heart/Diamond/Club/Spade.  Divvy each suit to their respective player.

You are The Adversary. You get a full deck of your own.

The Princesses interact with each other in their lives, then the monster of the week attacks! Everyone shuffles their decks.

The Adversary draws one card for the monster’s Strength and unique power; Princesses must meet or exceed this to score a hit. Each Princess describes what they are doing and draws a card from their deck. Each Princess must score one hit before the monster is weakened; one more hit defeats it.

The Monster draws a second card; the suit is an attack on that Princess! She draws a card to defend herself (losing two cards if unsuccessful.) A Princess is down if she is out of cards.

Princesses recover all lost cards when a monster is defeated.

The Princesses win by defeating 13 monsters.

MONSTERS
Hearts: Recovers one hit each round.
Diamonds: Requires two Princesses to score one hit for it to count.
Clubs: Can force a Princess to discard one extra card.
Spades: Can attack two Princesses. (Resolve separately.)

## The awakening of Asrya

```
It is a dark and foreboding night in Asrya, you and your fellows were moments ago wrapped in peaceful oblivion but powerful renegade magic has brought you all screaming back to the world of the living. Your party finds itself in the middle of a small town graveyard, you have all broken out of your tombs or clawed your way to the surface. You look upon each other and know you are cursed, that which is dead should stay dead. In the dead of the night you slowly realise what you are and speak to one another. Who could have ripped you from the afterlife and brought you back. With what little you were buried with you set out as a group to discover the world in chaos. The simple and peace races of men, elves and dwarves are beset by monsters from beyond the veil. Will you find the necromancer that awoke you? Will you help these people in need or turn on them in their darkest hour? The choice is yours.

## Factossimations
a story rpg system

```
SYNOPSIS~

Players operate FACTS, POSSIBILITIES, and TRANSFORMATIONS.

These create or change aspects about: CHARACTER (characters or groups); STORY (plot-lines, dialogue-cues, events...); and SETTING (place, conditions...); referring to past, present, or future.

PREPARATION~  
    
Breathe.   
    
Each player establishes:
    
1 fact about each: setting; setting history; and own character history;

3 facts about own character;
   
1 possibility about each: setting; setting history; story; story history; and another player's character.
  
GAME~

Each player receives 1 Transformation, 1 Possibility, and 3 Facts to use Per Scene. Establish these in-scene or as logical, changing existing or creating new  elements.
 
[Play character-affecting facts only on own character, unless whole group agrees otherwise.]

FACTS are true at creation.
    
Facts change possibilities into Facts, and Facts into Hard Facts.
    
HARD FACTS are difficult to change.
  
POSSIBILITIES remain uncertain until changed into Facts.
Possibilities change Facts into Transformations.
  
TRANSFORMATIONS remain active until changed into Facts.
    
Transformations change Facts into (new) Facts.
    
2 Transformations + 1 Possibility can amalgamate 2 Hard Facts into 1 (new) Hard Fact.
    
[Players organise sharing non-player-characters, or one takes host role by rotation or solely. Each npc has 4 own character Facts available when created or as necessary.]

## Purgatory House

```
You and your friends have stumbled on an old, creepy, and seemingly endless mansion. The House is evil and doesn’t want you to leave, though. New horrors lurk behind every door. Darkness strives to devour you.

One player plays as the House and tries to stop the others from leaving. Everyone else plays as themselves with the abilities and hindrances they actually possess. 

The last player alive is the only one who can escape the House.

The House describes the scene and the other players take turns narrating their actions. A hand of Blackjack is played against the House to resolve combat, or anytime a risk is taken. If the player wins then they succeed in their current task. If they lose, they fail. If they bust (more than 21) then they take serious damage. Once a player busts three times they are devoured.

The last player standing continues to narrate their attempts to flee. Once they win three more hands they have managed to escape the grounds and win the game! However, if they bust three times in total then they too have perished.

The House goes dormant. It waits. New victims will arrive... They always do.
```

## My Imaginary Friend

```
A game for three.

The Child wants to have fun, rebel, be noticed by adults. They describe their Friend and give them a name.

The Friend wants to be loved always by the Child, for only the Child truly sees them. Everyone else sees the Friend as an inanimate object, or doesn’t see them at all.

The World plays “everyone else”. They want to nurture the child, discipline them, and see them grow into a splendid adult.

Each player creates scenes as they come up with good ideas – take turns, share authority.

During each scene, the Child describes their actions and the World responds. The Friend also describes their actions, but only the Child may respond.

To resolve a challenge: the Child says what they want to happen. The others may agree or offer another outcome.

If all three players agree, that’s what happens. Otherwise, each rolls a die, highest roll gets to say what happens. On a tie, something else unexpected happens - the first person to call dibs gets to say what – but must do so immediately. Don’t call dibs and then dither!

Play until the Child outgrows their Friend, or until bedtime.
```
<hr> 

## Cross The Kitchen

```
Players each need a hero toy - action figures, superhero squinkies, or Lego minifgs work best. Also needed are a d6, d12 and tape measure.  The toy must make it across the room, stopping at each agreed upon checkpoint. 

Each round, players roll the d6, moving the hero up to that many feet toward the next checkpoint; and the d12 to check for hazards and boons. If the d12 comes up odd, the player has encountered a hazard. The opposing player(s) determine the nature and effect of the hazard. On an even roll, the player encounters a boon, and decides herself the effect of the powerup. Hazards and boons affect the hero’s speed, abilities, or the environment. The higher the roll, the more significant the effect (1 is the smallest possible hazard, 2 the smallest possible boon, etc).

Players use their characters’ powers to cross the room - flight, swinging on webs, leaping. The floor, of course, is magic phantom zone annihilation lava, so they will have to find a way across using furniture and objects. Touching the floor sends the toy back to the most recent checkpoint.

The winner is the first to reach the room’s final checkpoint.
```
<hr> 

## To Sea In A Sieve!

```
The players are the Jumblies, setting off to have adventures beyond the sea. In a sieve, naturally.

Each Jumbly has three skills: culineering (for creating food, machinery, or food-related machinery), seachanting (for singing, interpersonal & trading rolls), and unwibble (a jumbly with more unwibble is taller and braver). At game start they get 21 points to share between these as they wish. They must roll equal to or under their skill on 2d6 to pass a roll, taking into account any modifiers from the difficulty, equipment, etc.

Players may take 5 skills OR common household items of any sort the GM allows them and are of a tech level no later than ca 1800, excepting sporks, which are forbidden except to priests of the Jumbly deity Timballo. Priests of Timballo may *only* carry sporks as tools, but get a free starting block of stilton (effects unknown).

Note that Jumblies have no ability in combat at all but are able to set traps, talk, and run away quite effectively. Terrors might include giant silver-bees, the sea, or the Torrible Zone. Player goals may include purchasing certain items, exploring locations, finding new homelands, or simply eating as much cheese as possible.

## Denominator

```
Numbers.

LIFE is all numbers/figures to you, the Domicile’s three ONE PERCENTERS.

Life oppresses you with endless suggestions (therapy, “eye contact,” “take Haloperidol”).   

Question Life.  Parley with Life.

Sometimes, Life pompously doubts your existential narrative: “Could you really incapacitate 10 White Coats with your bare hands?”  

When this occurs, grab a bucket of diversely-sized dice.  Each of you pick one dice from the bucket and roll it.  Life picks first.  The highest roller settles the matter (reroll ties).  Life reveals something immutable about “Reality” (pfft) whenever it rolls highest (“You aren’t Batman.”)  Ignore anything said about numbers.

After rolling, claim your dice.  Its number is now yours (is it: [vengeful], [compassionate], [destructive], [flippant], [wary], or [perverted]?)  In the future, Claim all dice showing this number, and whenever this number is the highest roll, you, not the roller, narrate what happens (minding your number’s personality).  Life never claims dice.

When Life spits its figures at you (“She’s ‘16’ years old!”), you may shove one or more of your number friends into Life’s lying mouth to overwrite them (‘16’ can become ‘18’—or ‘187’—very quickly).  This changes Life, and returns dice used to the bucket.  

End when Life ceases doubting.

## Masters of the universe

```
You are all investment bankers. You each start with 3 coins, and you choose one of those coins and place it under your hand, with either heads or tails showing.

One person starts as the lead banker and tosses a coin. When it lands, everyone reveals their hands. Anyone who guessed correctly keeps their coin. Anyone who guessed incorrectly has to pass their coin on to the next person to their right who guessed correctly. 

The person with most coins at this point is the new lead banker. Everyone takes a turn to praise the lead banker for their skill and cleverness. The person who is most effusive, clever or funny must be rewarded with one of the lead bankers coins.

The process is then repeated until only one player has all the coins.

Anyone who loses all their coins in a round is out of the game and narrates the story of their downfall.

The last player with all the coins is declared the Master of the Universe.

## Our Ancestor’s Secret Wars

```
Underlying system: the Pool System by James V. West.

Get all the Aces through fours from a deck of cards and shuffle them up.  Deal two cards to each player.  One card will establish the player’s function and ancestry.  The other will be a family and technology they struggle with: Player’s choice between the two cards.  Or choose preference for both settings.  These are the only elements that do not change from game to game.

A - Pilot - Describes places / journey
2 - Engineer - Makes / provides vehicles / weapons / equipment
3 - Patreon - In charge of the missions, what is found, and the goal
4 - Hired Help - Useful for identifying enemies and creatures

Hearts - Verne’s & Moorcock’s - Steampunk
Clubs - Newton’s & DaVinci’s - Physicists
Diamond - Tesla’s & Edison’s - Electricity
Spades - Lovecraft’s & Crowley’s - Mysticism

It’s present day, and you are the hidden descendents of some prominent figures from the past.  You’ve been training in the technologies and methods that your ancestors developed in order to take on immortal enemies and eternal organizations.  While you may find some of the other families have ways discordant with your own, you will all have to work together in order to succeed.

## All For One, the flipped RPG

```
One player plays the hero. The rest are storytellers, who distribute these roles between themselves:
Architect: Sets the scene when the hero arrives somewhere. Moderates movement in the space.
Historian: Responsible for backstories, items and oddities. Adds details to the broad strokes of the Architect.
Foil: Roleplays the major NPC in each scene. Assigns minor NPCs to other storytellers, giving them: Personality or mood, Desire (what they want), and Conflict (what or who they’re struggling with).
Judge: Rules on challenges and conflicts (use any game system, or none). Assigns responsibilities to other storytellers as needed.
Director: Keeps an eye on plot and momentum. Introduces events or changes locations if things stagnate.
 
Before play, the hero player takes ONE MINUTE to describe their hero, then leaves the room. The storytellers sketch out the plot, led by the Director, spending ONE MINUTE on each of:
>Where is the hero? Why? What occurrence will draw them into the story?
>What obstacles will the hero face? Who or what will aid them? How will the story change them?
>How does the story end? How does this reflect the changes within the hero? How does it resolve the occurrence that began the story?
 
Play begins!

## Dragon Soul

```
Chaos threatens the Middle Lands. The Pale King raises necrotic armies. Insectoid demons of the Million Hells infect reality. The mechanical warriors of the Ochre Horde are at the gates. You have the Dragon Soul - the power of a god! Will you rise to the challenge and become a hero?

As player, fill the [trait] in the sentence below:

I am [name], who [power] and wields [weapon]; my burden is [burden].

Your Soul starts at 1; for every [trait] that wow’s the other players, raise your Soul by 1, maximum 5. Think about [traits] that are larger than life.

In a Conflict, describe your intentions; be cinematic, gravity-defying, god-like; if you wow the other players, raise your Soul by 1 for this Conflict. Grab 1d6 for every [trait] that applies, roll under Soul to succeed; if you fail, Soul drops by 1 - if your [burden] applied, decide on something bad. Against Minions, every success defeats one; against Rivals, every success lowers their Soul by 1. You become Mortal if your Soul reaches 0.

As GM, scene-frame aggressively, create engaging Antagonists that threaten the world and reality itself, and interesting locations for fight scenes; create situations that target the character’s [burden].

## European

```
Distribute four blank index cards, markers, and a random role to each player; roles remain secret.

Roles are:

HANDOFF
HITMAN
BUYER
DEALER
UNDERCOVER
DINER

Each player may go to the bathroom four times, and can be in the bathroom for up to thirty seconds at a time. When going to the bathroom, they first write down what they will do in the bathroom. (Ex. Hide knife, look for money, pee) If the player is leaving/taking something from the bathroom, they must leave/take that card. A player cannot use a card that has already been written on.

HANDOFF needs to get the murder weapon to HITMAN, who needs to kill DEALER (and no one else) to win.

DEALER needs to get the package to BUYER, and BUYER needs to get the money to DEALER (without being caught) to win.

UNDERCOVER wins by using their one accusation to correctly identify a pair of criminals. (HANDOFF/HITMAN, BUYER/DEALER)

DINER has an overactive bladder- they can only use their cards to pee, and must use them all by game’s end.

If you die, you lose. Multiple players can win.

Game ends with a murder, successful accusation, or all cards used.

## Catalyst of Annihilation

```
Two acquaintances stumble into each other through pure coincidence. The world is doomed because of this chance encounter.

Describe who the characters are and how they know each other. Discuss tone and setting (mythic, mundane, supernatural, military, sci-fi, etc).  

One starts as the Asker. The other starts as the Answerer. 

ASKING
Asker, ask a leading or prying question starting with Who, What, Where, When, Why, or How.  

RESPONDING
Answerer, pick a response from the list below and flesh out the past, present or future as directed. Then, start a new round as the Asker.  

Refuse
Refuse to answer the question. It reminds you of a past failure. Flashback to a past frustration that brought you here. 

Obfuscate
Lie or stall. Something in the present is more pressing. Describe a change in the immediate scene.

Answer 
Describe a scene at the end of the world. Include the corresponding prompt’s detail from the table below. Then, answer the question in the present. Cross off the question’s prompt. 

Prompt...      Detail
Who...         Concluding regret.  
What...        Desecrated touchstone.   
Where...       Profane bodies. 
When...        Devoured hope.
Why...         Gnawing void.
How...         Cataclysmic instrument.

ENDING
The game ends when all prompts are spent and the world’s fate is sealed.

## Too Much Bubblegum: More than you can chew!

```
Aliens are amongst us and it's time to fight back! ...But this bubblegum won't chew itself.

Every player adds a handful of d6s (bubblegum) to a pile on the table. Shuffle two jokers into a 52-card deck.

Each round, players take however much bubblegum they want from the pile (minimum one).

Count the remaining bubblegum. Each player takes turns drawing a card face-up until one card has been drawn for each bubblegum left in the pile.

If you draw a joker, roll the dice you took. If any die comes up 1, you're abducted! Shuffle everyone's cards back into the deck before you go, and come back next round as an infiltrator.

At the end of the round, shuffle the deck and discard all the dice you took: you chewed that bubblegum or died trying!

Once per game you can swallow your gum: re-roll all 1s. (Don’t eat the dice.)

If an infiltrator draws a joker, they pick a human to roll instead.

If you run out of humans, the aliens win.

If you start a round with no pile left, you've chewed all the bubblegum and the remaining humans can start fighting the aliens!

## No Mistakes, Only Deeper Plans

```
For any number of players, each of whom wants to walk away with the full contents of the Vault. Think to yourself what you'd do with all that money -- debts paid, loved ones saved, mistakes undone.

This game jumps back and forth between two scenes: the planning stage of a heist, and the heist itself.

Planning stage: Players discuss their plan for breaking into the Vault. How to distract guards, steal keys, deactivate cameras. You work together to get in, but remember that only one person can leave with the money. When you feel confident, move to the heist stage.

Heist stage: Players take turns executing the plan, rolling dice to perform anything difficult. Roll 2d6 and sum them -- anything above a 10 grants players a bonus, but anything under a 7 is a failed action. Once an action is failed, jump back to the planning phase -- failing here was all part of the plan. Explain how your failure was all part of the plan, and how you move forward now.

Once a player is in the vault, all bets are off. No more planning stage, just action in the moment. The person who walks out with the money wins.

## Anti Heroes

```
The future. In the stellar void.
Humanity is dying. Centuries of war has ended galactic conquest and procreation is but a memory. We are doomed.

Still a light seems to burn low in the darkness. The apostle writings are formals, Mankind will find a way if the holy relic of Foedric was to be found again.

But all heroes are dead. We are alone. Only the worst ones remains. And they are our only chance to survive.
Jeriko “Ivan the terrible”
Horus “Ramses”
Stunner ”Attila”
Okto ”Gengis Khan”
Firefly ”Saladin”
Dirt ”Erik the Red”
Malebot ”Vlad Tepes”

Anti Heroes put you in the role of the most dangerous badass of the entire galaxy.
Former military gone mad in warzone, bodyparts dealers from the most violent syndicates of the solar system or renown murderers just escaped from maximum security, each of them has a part of the riddle somewhere in their twisted mind.

Captured by the Apostles of the Funeral Cathedral, they have accepted a suicide mission which may grant them salvation if they manage to find the last chance to save what’s left of humanity.

Hoping who they used to be in a previous life can be kept under control.

## Looking for new recruits!

```
The age of space exploration. A violent and uncertain time for the crew of this generic spaceship. Valued crew members are replaced by new recruits, more incompetent than ever. Feels like a low budget sci-fi TV show? Maybe it is.

Your ship is (under attack / crash-landing / falling apart in hyperspace / stuck in customs / rat-infested / drifting powerless), your mission is to (find the mole / deliver aid / escort diplomats / make first contact / mutiny / find out why cameramen follow you).

Recruits
Choose a field of specialty.
For skill checks roll a d6. Add +2 if specialty is relevant.
On a natural 1 you fail spectacularly and another crewman dies horribly.
He is replaced by an incompetent new recruit, who subtracts -1 from each roll.

Once per session a recruit can choose to automatically succeed at a task, but another recruit will have to die with a -2 penalty to her rolls.

Death penalty is cumulative. The last person to roll a 6 is the one to die.

Only one recruit can aid another if possible. Add +1 to result.

Task resolution
Difficulty ranges from 5 (everyday responsibilities) to 11 (impossible). If the recruit rolls:
Difficulty-1: yes, but…
Difficulty: yes.
Difficulty+1: yes, and...

## The Things We Do For Love

```
2 Players and a Judge

The players decide on a familial relationship (siblings, parent/child, cousins, etc.)

The judge determines a setting (modern world, fantasy, sci-fi, horror, etc.)

Player one has something (money, gold coins, a piece of technology, a cursed dagger, etc. This is determined by the Judge) that Player two wants. Player two has to convince player one to give it to them, while Player one refuses. In the course of the argument, Player one and Player two make up their mutual history. The Judge keeps track of said history and determines the winner based on most creative back-story and reasons for needing the item/not being able to give it up. A player who incorrectly refers to a previously mentioned point of mutual history has automatically lost the argument and therefore the game.

## Night clubbing

```
We are old friends reuniting or bored youth looking for more.
We are on a night out in a metropolitan city of delights or an asphalt mile of dive bars.
Each character toasts the night ahead and their companions, they take a drink token.
Narrate your night together, take turns, go slowly.
When you want to do something that might matter; roll a d6 and score higher than your drink tokens.
If you succeed, narrate your success, otherwise take a drink token, choose an option and change your location:
* Tell everyone a secret about yourself
* Tell someone what you really think about them
* Buy everyone a round, everyone gets a drink token, salut!
* Bring the group into jeopardy by antagonising someone dangerous or going somewhere you shouldn't
* Provoke the authorities and flee the consequences with your companions
* Shame yourself
When you have six drink tokens; pass out. Once each scene you may narrate a strange vision for the others which may or may not be real.
When there are only two characters left decide whether they are going to go home together.
If not then narrate an omen of your collective alcoholic oblivion, otherwise describe the dawn arriving.

## The Orpheus Trail

```
The road to Hell is paved with the bodies and possessions of the settlers who went ahead of you. Rumor says the colonists of the first circle of Hell mine rare minerals and grow rich off strange soul-powered sciences. Meanwhile Earth swelters, overcrowded and suffering. How different could it be?

Three types of people take the risk: SINNERS, SCIENTISTS, and SECURITY.

SINNERS shorten the road to Hell by SINNING. SCIENTISTS and SECURITY can FIGHT DEMONS, PERFORM TECHNOMAGIC, and LOOT NEARBY RUINS, but they are at the mercy of the SINNERS for travel.

The colonist caravan will not reach the first circle of Hell until the characters have performed all seven mortal sins: GLUTTONY, LUST, GREED, PRIDE, WRATH, ENVY, and SLOTH.

SINNERS may teach other characters to SIN, but by doing so they surrender their power over the caravan. Many SINNERS are press-ganged, unwillingly recruited from prison. Extort your fellow colonists for the best chance at a new life! Or teach them what you know in exchange for TECHNOMAGIC and SAFE HAVEN.

Establish character relationships. Take turns starting scenes. Survive demon attacks, ford rivers of blood or pay the ferryman, and gaze on the ruined wonders of the afterlife. Adventure awaits!

<hr> 

## Survivors on an Uncharted Island

```
You are plane crash survivors on an uncharted island.

Rescue is impossible.

Define each main character survivor with an intriguing question (e.g. why is Amanda pretending to be amnesiac?). Once per session, you may add a question to a survivor you don’t play. If any character has no questions, they can die.

You may play multiple survivors. 

---

Anyone may say “Try it a different way” or “Go deeper” if they feel something is inappropriate or superficial.

---

On an index card, draw a line to represent the coast where you’ve crashed. ALWAYS define questions (on adjacent cards) for the nearest uncharted areas. Anyone may create a question. Each question should potentially have mundane and weird explanations. Insert or modify cards when you discover new areas or resolve questions.

Cards can go down, in, or backwards (in time).

Assign a player to be the Authority on what’s true about each new aspect of the island.

If an action is risky or the outcome unknown, define (as a group) the worst, best, and in-between outcomes. Roll 1d6: 1 = worst, 6 = best. The appropriate Authority (or, if none, a group-nominee) narrates.

---

Play to answer questions and see if anyone escapes the island.

## The Beasts Shall No Longer Walk This Earth

```
You are Beast Hunters. Each of you write:
your family name
your talent
one thing you brought
one thing your mentor taught

These are your ELEMENTS.

You are hunting a Beast. Take turns describing:
	its name
	what it looks like
	the most dangerous thing about it
	why it must be hunted
	why it’s hard to hunt
	where it’s found

Note them. These are the Beast’s ELEMENTS.

When you journey to hunt the Beast, take turns describing.

If you do something tough, or against the Beast, roll 1d10.
Add 1 for each your ELEMENTS that apply,
Subtract 1 for each of the Beast’s ELEMENTS that works against you.

If you get a total of 7 or higher, success. Otherwise, failure.

Success: the Beast loses an ELEMENT. Choose which. When it has none left, it is slain.
Failure: choose one ELEMENT to lose (explain why). If you have none left, you die.

If you kill the Beast, everyone adds an ELEMENT of what they learned. Make a new Beast as before, but add one ELEMENT for each previous Beast slain.
If you are killed, the Beast gains an ELEMENT. (describe what)
If everyone is killed, a new group will fight the Beast.
```

## Storyboard

```
You are cartoon characters, and you must draw your way to the promised land.

You will each need:

Your favorite pencil
Some index cards
A timer

Whoever has the weirdest doodle in their notebook leads first.

When you lead, tell the followers what the obstacle is and how long they have to solve it.

When you follow, take that time to draw yourself overcoming the obstacle. You all draw at the same time, in secret. Pencils down when the leader says so.

When time is up, the leader chooses the funniest solution. That drawing goes on the end of the storyboard, moving everyone towards the promised land. The others branch off anywhere else on the storyboard; they’re the misadventures you had on the way.

The game ends when the storyboard reaches the edge of the table you’re playing on, or if anyone gets bored or checks their cell phone. If it’s the former, you each write down one thing about the promised land in secret, then reveal it at the same time. All these things are true.

If it’s the latter, gather your notecards. Your characters never reached the promised land, and are trapped forever in your backpack.

## Godzilla Is Attacking The City

```
You are victims of Godzilla’s rampage through the city. Your lives are flashing before your eyes. You each take turns telling your stories.

Make a list of Words to use in your stories. Adjectives and verbs work best for this. Ten Words per player should be enough.
 
Each player has six health points.

The tallest player goes first.

Tell your story. When you use one of the Words, roll a six-sided die (d6). If the result is six, you don’t lose any health and take another turn. A result of two through five subtracts one health and ends your turn. A result of one angers Godzilla and your location is attacked. Lose two health and end your turn. You may only use one Word per turn and may not use a Word more than once per game.

When your health reaches zero, you die.  

You may attempt to steal the turn by making a cameo. Yell, “Godzilla is attacking the city!” Then, use the last Word the active player used in your cameo, but only if you haven’t used it yet. The two players roll a d6. The player who rolled highest continues their story.
```
<hr> 

## As the Crow Flies

```
The Crows have offered absolution; secrets for salvation.

To play you’ll need a...
...trusted consort
...small coffer and key
...city to roam and wander

One of you must bear the Coffer, the other the Key. Begin by placing a secret into the Coffer, one each.

Secrets are…
*Known only by you
*Devastating if revealed
*Intimately connected to a Nexus
*Written on scraps of paper

When you bear the Key, keep it safe.

When you bear the Coffer, spend your days walking through the City alone as if you did not carry such dark secrets. Follow the crows to the places they gather, search for the things which have fallen through the cracks; something, anything that reminds you of one of your Secrets. This is your Nexus. 

Now find your consort, place your Nexus and its corresponding Secret into the Coffer, and choose 1:
*Unburden Yourself
*Make your Offering

When you unburden yourself, exchange the Coffer for the Key and all related duties.

When you make your offering, travel together. Your destination must be:
*Far from Home
*Windswept
*Watched Over by Crows

When you reach your destination, open the Coffer. Leave. Hope against all hope that they find your offering worthwhile.

GM describes scenes, presents challenges. When players attempt something interesting: GM determines Skill used, requests Check.

Checks
GM chooses difficulty (standard is 2; each complication +1).
Player rolls d6 dice equal to Skill Points. On each die: 4+ succeed and 6 explode (always roll 6s again, counting successes). 
If fewer successes than Difficulty: 
•Fail the Check (GM narrates outcome)
•Lose [Difficulty - successes] HP
•Gain 1 XP

Rests
Rest for 1 hour: regain all HP. Optionally train one skill: spend XP equal to its Skill Points to increase it by 1 or rewrite its Action.

Endgame
•Death at 0 HP.
•Ascend at 25 total Skill Points. Describe how this changes the world.

## The Orb

```
In a distant future, the orb is one of the key parts of human existence.

Discuss the following:
• what is the orb's functions?
• what are the orb's components, and how does it look like?
• what groups are affected by the orb or have a relation to it? Name at least three.

Each participant come up with a character of their own that has something to do with one or several of the groups. At least three groups should be represented by all the participants' characters. Each participant declares the agenda of the character, which is a version of the following three:
• steal the orb
• change the orb
• destroy the orb

During the declaration, it's also important to tell why the character has that agenda (even if it may be a secret).

The game ends when more than half of the participants can reach their goals through terms of agreement.

Discuss how.

## After the Rain

```
Divide your players into 2 factions: The Mark, a single person; and The Agents, everyone else. The Mark is a target of the Agents, mercenary AI who are infiltrating their digital subconscious to find and steal a thing of value. The Mark deals 10 playing cards face down in front of them. They ask the Agents “who am I and what do you want from me?” The Agents respond with their answer, collectively. That answer is the Mark’s last card in their deck.

When play begins, the mark flips over a card and describes the space the Agents now occupy: Hearts are someplace liminal; spades are someplace ancient; clubs are someplace foreign; diamonds are someplace hostile. Face cards are populated by one or many other intelligences, the number represents how challenging the level is to clear. With each new level, the Mark declares their conditions for clearing the level; once these conditions are met they flip the card over and reveal the next level. Agents take turns declaring actions they take to complete the Mark’s conditions, the Mark counters with questions, elaborations, and challenges. Once the final card is reached, the Mark reminds the Agents of what they are taking.

## Muscle/brains/gut

```
You're a small group of Neanderthals trying to survive. Hunting wooly mammoths, foraging the wilderness for edible plants, sickness and especially encounters with Homo Sapiens endanger your existence.

You have 3 options to tackle problems: muscle (rock), brains (paper) and gut (scissors).  Every action is decided by a game of muscle/brains/gut (rock/paper/scissors) between the player and the GM. Every tie makes the consequences of a win/loss bigger, possible consequences of a win or loss should be communicated beforehand by the GM. After at least 4 ties in a row the game ends when the player or the GM eventually wins the game of muscle/brains/gut. Consequences are total species loss or species domination, depending on who wins.

Muscle: solve problems with strength, fighting, ...
Brains: solve problems by thinking, smartness, ...
Gut: solve problems by a luck, quick reactions, …

## Secret Identity

```
Being superheroes Disrupts your lives, played with a deck of cards. Before starting decide how many “weeks” to play. One round, one week.

Draw a random card from each suit as your character’s “Stats”. The suits represent four major Categories. Face cards=10, Ace=11.

Hearts-Love
Clubs-Social
Spades-Work/School
Diamonds-Appearance/Reputation

Happiness increases from 0-10, starting at 4.

Once/Round you may Spend 1 Happiness to draw a replacement Stat card for any category/character, even Empty. Spend again to add the Draw to the Stat instead of replacing it.

Each Round, draw a card for the Disruption (sneaking out, hiding bruises, sudden battle, etc.) and compare against Stat. 

Underperform: When your Stat < Draw, “Threaten” the Stat by turning its card sideways and discard the Draw. Lose one Happiness. You still use this card. 

Empty: Underperforming with a threatened Stat instead leaves the Stat Empty until replaced. Lose 3 Happiness. Comparing against Empty Stats reduces happiness by 1 instead.

Overcome: When your Stat > Draw, replace Stat with Draw, gain one Happiness. For every difference of 5 gain one more. It doesn’t matter if your Stat was threatened when replaced.

(Recommended: representing Happiness with candy or the cards you overcome.)

## Rubble

```
You have survived the apocalypse. The wastes around you has taken its toll on your group. Between the bandits, starvation, and hunting creatures, you and the other survivors must make sacrifices to protect those that are left; your family and loved ones.

Materials: 
Notecards
Timer
Coins
4-Sided Die (d4)

1. Each player writes down their character name and 3 Things on a note-card. These “Things” can include anything the players can think of in a group of survivors. At least one should include another survivor in the group.  
	Something to Protect 
	Something to Keep Secret
	Something Worth Fighting For

2. Danger has struck, roll the d4 to determine it.
	1. Bandits
	2. Starvation
	3. Creature
	4. Equipment Failure

3. Discuss with the others what the danger is and who should face the it. The players have 10 minutes for this. The player(s) who face the danger take a coin. If none of the players face it, cross one item off of a note-card.

4. The game ends when one player gains 5 coins, when a total of 12 Things have been crossed out, or when one player has crossed out all of their things.

## An uncertain trial

```
A scene begins. An accusatory statement about one of the players is made. The accused player rolls a die. A higher number means the accusation is more truthful, lower meaning it is more false. Only the accused player may now the result, and can interpret the roll freely if enough ambiguity exists. Any player who wishes to participate in the scene may do so freely. The players must decide if the accusation is true and deal out punishment if it is. The accused must avoid punishment without revealing the roll. The scene proceeds with as many players as desired, for as long as the players desire. At the end of the scene it is revealed how truthful the accusation was. If the players make the wrong choice, they lose. If the accused is punished, he/she loses.

## Myrathine

```
A nameless protector spirit of the forested island Myrathine notices strange invaders on its shores that have begun to destroy the island ecosystem.
The player assumes control of the spirit and has to fight back against the human settlement and its relentless robotic workers to protect the island from destruction.
However, the spirit has no corporeal form and must possess wildlife or humans in order to affect the physical world.
Possessing wildlife allows for direct combat with the robots, but each killed animal vessel will damage the ecosystem as well.
Possessed humans are never attacked by their robots, but must find clever noncombat solutions to encounters since the humans themselves cannot fight.
The situation gets increasingly complicated as the motivation of the humans is slowly revealed over time.
They have to destroy the island and harness a strange power that slumbers beneath it in order to save the rest of the world from annihilation.
The spirit can then either ally itself to a destruction opposed, middle ground seeking splinter faction among the humans, continue the campaign against all human invaders, help them destroy the island to save the world or try and claim the slumbering power for itself.

## Treaty at the Stones of Black and White

```

Learn Go. Play.

Half to 3/4 of the way through the game, pause.  Hold peace talks and negotiations. 

Each player rolls a d6 for a Secret objective.  
1.	Randomly select a personal enemy. 
2.	Get the captured stones released.
3.	Gain control of another formation on the board.
4.	Grow your territory by placing stones on the board.  
5.	Secure a Trade route.  Gain a right-of-way from every player the route passes.
6.	Make your own.  

Each player chooses a formation on the board.  That is their army, tribe, or geographic region.  Deal a card from any deck, Magic, tarot or standard playing cards.  

Take turns introducing yourself, using your card and area on the board.  Then roll a die publicly, odd you are loyal (to the color your formation is made from) even you are treacherous.  Then secretly roll a die. Loyal players have only a 25% chance of choosing to betray their color and only to secure their secret objective. Treacherous players will stay loyal 25% of the time.  The other 75% they can betray if they want. 

Start negotiations. The war isn’t over.  In turn order if you chose, you may place a stone.

```

## SYSTEM

```
You need two players: one plays the ENFORCER, second plays the SYSTEM.

First the ENFORCER:
So, you are enforcer/secret policeman/other for an oppressive regime. 
Regime wasn't always like that.

You joined in because:
- you were poor and this work had great promise
- you believed in the specific ideals of the SYSTEM
- something else

ENFORCER: name the ideals important for you, at least 3, you get IDEALS 3.
SYSTEM: add another 3 ideals to the list.

SYSTEM player starts to describe how those ideas get implemented, how they are supposed to work.
For each idea collaboratively think what ugly thing it could make ENFORCER do.

ENFORCER, roll: 2d6+IDEALS
On 10+ : you can't ignore it. Tell SYSTEM you stand up against it.
SYSTEM: Explain to ENFORCER why he is wrong and add consequence (for him).
7-9 : You can pick - you either challenge (see 10+), or ignore it (IDEALS -1, cross off one)
6- : You can't change it. You get IDEALS -1.

When you get to 0 IDEALS, you can walk away, but there is cost. SYSTEM has to name three things that will affect you and your family. Ugly things.

Jointly decide how it ends.
I'm sorry.

## The Chronicles of...

```
One player introduces themselves as the Archivist; traveller, tale-keeper, and stranger to these lands. Your clothes are well-worn and foreign; your pack is heavy with inks and tomes. Wandering, you’ve happened upon a small group of local people. Describe yourself to them.

The other players are inhabitants of this land, full of tales and histories. Take a moment together to discuss what makes this place unique, then tell the Archivist what you call it. Describe your immediate surroundings and why you’re there.

The Archivist asks questions, prompting stories about the land and its people.

While an inhabitant tells a story, another may say, “Isn’t it the case that…” The storyteller (or someone else) will either revise the story, working in this detail, or explain how that is, in fact, not that case.

If an inhabitant has personal knowledge on a matter, they may say “You’re lying, here’s the truth…” The storyteller (or someone else) will either recant, reworking the tale in light of this, or refute the claim.

At any time the Archivist may ask for more details, or say, “In [another land, giving details] they say that…” The inhabitants will acknowledge or deny any relation.

NAMES:



Each has a Wound--emotional? Physical?--that she’s taken. When?

WOUNDS:

Narrate: Why?

Each has a Fabulous Magical Accessory!

Your Adversary’s vulnerable to Girls feeling an un-circled emotion. Which? Why? Underline it.

The player with longest hair goes first. 

On your turn, choose one:

Clash!: narrate Adversary action/dialogue, your evasion/reaction: Elegant, Clever, Tough, or Desperate. Moved, one other Girl changes her Emotion. 

Flashback!: play a flashback with another Girl. Change each other's Emotions. 

Promise!: as the battle rages, speak your Promise to another Girl. Extend your hand: if she takes it and speaks, one of you changes her Emotion to match the other. If not, she changes yours.

Triumph!: If a Girl feels the underlined Emotion, -OR- all Girls feel the same Emotion, narrate your (Spectacular? Hard-won? Pyrrhic?) victory!

## So here is the Scenario

```
This is a game for four to five and one DM the DM pitches a scenario  and gives form to the setting and situation. The players then roll dice and highest begins taking place in the scene as a character. Play goes round table the next person takes over DM duties making sure to complete these task during play as more people take over everyone stays in the scene and things grow more interesting.

1. Move forward - This can be anything not just "moving" but they must make forward motion in some way in the scene.

2. Act upon the setting and find an impedance.

3. Find or introduce a new aspect that might help the situation

4. Act towards your next action and pass the narrative while introducing yourself as a character.

And then as the first player passes  the next DM takes control each round should be about 10-12 minutes once every player has gone once the first DM sets up the finish.During which the group goes one more time around as the players work together to end the scenario. 

```
<hr> 

## And We Are All Together

```
Stare at the player on your left. Blink slowly. When you open your eyes, your body has been possessed by the mind of the player on your right.

As a group you have one hour to work out what just happened, why it's happened to you, and how to reverse it. If you don't then the effects get weirder. 

Each of you knows one relevant thing. Each of you also has one secret or repressed memory, which you will recall if another player confronts you about it.

## This Is Not an RPG

```
Inspired by the automatic techniques of surrealist artists.

Requirements: Friends, pencils, paper, a game spinner or paper folded into a point that you can spin, absinthe (optional)

1. Goal: Each player writes a verb, adjective and noun. Spin to determine whose answer fills each blank. If a player is selected multiple times, spin again.

"We must [VERB] the [ADJECTIVE] [NOUN]."

Write the completed goal on a separate piece of paper.

2. Characters: Each player writes entries for the bracketed words below. Spin to select a player. Spin again to select their character's first name, then go clockwise to fill in the rest. Repeat for each player, respinning if necessary.

"I'm [FIRST NAME] [LAST NAME], a [ADJECTIVE] [NOUN]. My ability is [ABILITY]. My weakness is [WEAKNESS]."

Write the completed character descriptions below the goal.

3. Begin: Each player writes a sentence to establish the start of the scenario. Spin. The selected player expands on their sentence, describing what happens (in two minutes or less) using the goal and character descriptions as a guide, and ending at a moment of decision/uncertainty.

4. Play: Repeat step 3, describing what happens next. Continue until the goal succeeds, fails -- or something else entirely.

-Decide first move with players rolling the die with the lower roll going first

-A turn consist of one of the following actions:

<hr> 

## Petty Crimes

```
Players play a gang of petty criminals trying to make ends meet.

Each player requires a 52-card deck.

To create a character distribute 10 points among these abilities (minimum 0, maximum 5):
Brawn– strength, toughness
Reflexes– quickness, coordination
Senses– awareness, intuition
Brains– intelligence, memory

At the start of the game, the GM draws five cards from their deck and places them face-up in the middle of the table. These are the communal cards. Use the suits of the communal cards to help determine the type of crime, or choose your own.
Hearts– drug related
Diamonds– burglary
Clubs– extortion
Spades– theft, fencing
The number of cards in the suit of your crime represents the size of the payoff. Highest value card represents the difficulty.

When the GM presents a challenge, they assign it a rating and draw that many cards. Players draw cards equal to the ability being tested. Using these cards, and the five communal cards, each player makes a 5-card poker hand. Players must beat the GM to succeed, or each other for inter-character conflict. Once resolved, all cards are discarded and the GM redraws the communal cards. Players reshuffle their decks when all their cards have been discarded.

## Fair Verona Burns: A Tragedy in Three Acts

```
“These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which, as they kiss, consume.”

Collaboratively detail a setting and 10+ hot-blooded characters evenly representing two feuding factions. Detail characters: “[Name], the [adjective] [noun].”

Take turns: Frame a scene featuring any two characters and select one to roleplay. Another player roleplays the second. Remaining players may roleplay additional characters as dramatically appropriate. After every scene, collaboratively assign one-way Passions (hate, love, or exploiting) among participating characters.

Act One (scenes 1-3): No open violence. End after satisfying escalation.

Act Two (scenes 4+): End scenes when someone dies. Roleplay until someone attacks, embraces (with consent), or exploits one or more others. All involved roll 1d6. Lowest roller loses and narrates scene outcomes (ties both lose): 
  --Attack = loser dies.
  --Embrace = winner’s ally dies (probably off-screen)
  --Exploit = loser’s ally dies (probably off-screen)

Act Three (when 2-3 characters remain): Collaboratively resolve a climax and fallout. Each remaining character rolls 1d6 per Passion, and pursues the highest-rolled Passion (choose among ties). If pursued Passions match, resolve accordingly. Otherwise, characters each roll 1d6 and narrate by the winner’s pursued Passion. 

Is your tale ultimately tragic, reconciliatory, ugly, cathartic, or something else altogether?

<hr> 


## First Datepocalypse

```
4 - 10 players.

Each player takes a turn vocally progressing the story and outlining their actions.

Each phase listed below consists of two player turns. Turns are taken by each player in a clockwise direction.

INTRODUCTIONS
Each player introduces their own fictional character. The player that has last gone on a date introduces their character as the first lover. They always go to pick up their date from the home of the second player character. 

Both players decide on the date location and time. 

The third player should be in attendance of the date location, such as an employee, and so should every other player thereafter except the last player. They will always introduce themselves as the antagonist. Example: a jealous ex-girlfriend.

CONFLICT
There should be a creative and surprising stand-off between everyone in the game.

CONCLUSION
Each player rolls 1 six sided die for their character. If a 6 is rolled their character is uninjured. If any other number is rolled the next player describes how the previous player character has died.

Whoever is alive after the last round are more than likely drenched in blood and psychologically scarred. Wrap up their actions in one sentence.

## Advent

```
Over the next five weeks, an outlandish, distressing event will turn your little community upside down. The exact nature of the “Advent” is to be discovered in play, if at all.
Each week, the event will unfold and generate new trials as well as new opportunities for you, the heroes, to explore. 
At the start of the week, one player interprets what challenge the event brings from the weekly thematic statements below. Another describes a personal opportunity arising from the event: something about greed, power, faith, love or second chances. The remaining player(s) play out how their character seeks help, resources or solutions to overcome the challenge and decide if they seize the opportunity.
The players then switch roles around the following week.
The consequences of the Advent can be evaded, limited or fought, but can neither be stopped nor reversed.

Timeline
Week 1   A breach in the ordinary appears

Week 2   A terrifying growth

Week 3   Friends turn into foes

Week 4   Roots of the community are threatened

Week 5 	 The outside world has stopped responding

Epilogue The Advent is part of the new normal. Discuss how your community        
                 has changed as a consequence, if it’s still standing.

## Eternal Rivals

```
Two samurai meet under a blossoming cherry tree to settle a life-long feud. 
Hands on the hilts of their katanas, they wait for a moment of clarity to strike.


Setup:
Each samurai takes 10 six-sided dice and hides them behind a folded piece of paper. 


Play:
One samurai narrates a way in which the other was insulting in the past.
This can be anything: from having eaten with the wrong-coloured chopsticks to having slept with the Daimyo’s daughter.

The other samurai must defend his conduct.

Each one then secretly takes a number of dice to hold in his hand (from 0 to 10). 

Both players roll them simultaneously. 

Each 4-5-6 is a winning die: 
The player who has the most winning dice has won the argument and sets the winning dice apart in their victory pile. Ties go to the insulted samurai. 
All the other dice are discarded in shame.

The narrating role is exchanged until all dice are in victory piles or discarded.
 

End:
Both samurai take their victory dice and roll them one final time.
The one with the most winning dice kills the opponent. 
A tie means that both samurai kill each other.

Honor must be avenged!

## Reuinited And It Feels...

```
It's been too long, or maybe not long enough, since you saw one another. But here you are. Just the two of you. In public, but alone, together. You have business to sort out, and maybe a relationship to rebuild, or maybe to bury. But you have to get through the silence to do it.

Meet in a public place; a coffee shop, an airport, a bar. Somewhere you can hear people talking. Sit together in silence, listening to the voices in the air.

When you hear a joke, or laughter, remember and reminisce on the connection you used to have. When you hear silence, or sadness, remember and emphasize what drove you apart. When you hear anger, lash out in fear, or else they might first and then you've lost the fight (wait, was this a FIGHT?). When you get caught up in a story, get lost in your memories; ignore the other player. When you hear the nondescript buzz but no emotion, focus on what brought you here, and try to get it over with.

When you've said all you can say, decide if it's worth rebuilding your relationship. Hopefully it is. It's okay if it isn't.

## There Is No Way Out Of This Arena

```
This is a game about gladiatorial combat, for 2 core players, and, optionally, any number of observers.

One person plays The Gladiator, and one person plays The Arena. The Gladiator describes what they're fighting for (glory, God, survival, the thrill) and why they're in the arena, and rolls 1d100 to determine their health at the start of the game. Each round, The Arena rolls 1d20 to determine the damage they inflict on The Gladiator. They then describe what challenges The Gladiator faces, and The Gladiator describes how they defeat them, if they still have health left, or how they are defeated, if they don't.

If there are any observers, they play The Audience. They describe who is watching the battle and how the audience feels about it/The Gladiator themselves. In their Mercy, The Audience can, once per game give an extra d20 to The Gladiator, to put off the end for a little longer. Or, should they so choose, they can give their extra d20 to The Arena, which can be a Mercy, too.

The game continues until The Gladiator is out of health, but can easily be started again.

The Arena is always ready for another Gladiator.

## EPYC

```
​Everyone needs a long sheet of paper and a pen. 

Understanding the past is tricky. ​Somewhere amid the myriad accounts, legends, songs, and artworks might hide a truth. This is a world building game. We're not looking for the truth; we're creating fragments.

In the top fifth or so of your paper write the name of a long-lost people and describe where and when they lived.

Pass your paper to the right.

On your new paper, create some art (e.g., drawing, lines of a song) from that people. Copy their name on your panel and fold the paper so only your art is visible.

Pass right.

On your new paper, describe some lore (e.g., myth, folk cure, urban legend) from that people. Copy their name on your panel and fold so only your lore is visible.

Pass right.

On your new paper, write a first person account of some major upheaval or cultural event the people experienced or celebrated. Copy their name on your panel and fold so only your account is visible.

Pass right.

Repeat: Art, Lore, Account

When you’ve no more room, reclaim your paper. Try writing a short textbook entry about the people you named.

## The Last Summer

```
You are teenage students in a hostile town. In one tragic summer, each of you will lose your lives. But your story will be told. It won’t be forgotten.

You are not: white, male, straight, cisgendered, or considered normal. This is why you die, and in many cases, helps explain why life was hard. After picking one or more of those traits, flesh out your characters.

Games of blackjack decide the result of encounters. If you beat the Dealer, you win the encounter, but revenge will follow. If you bust or fail to beat the Dealer, you lose. A character must play blackjack at least once a month.

The game starts in June. School’s out. Trouble is afoot. The Dealer must play blackjack with everyone at once.

July. Revenge approaches. The Dealer only plays blackjack against pairs or trios.

August. Death follows. The Dealer plays blackjack with only one character at a time.

September. The story ends for everyone. Contemplate every encounter. Tell the stories of how you died, either by homicide or suicide. After you do so, speculate on how the world changes for the better, even if you don’t get to see it.

Take a deep breath.

## Alien Zookeepers Go!

```
Requires: Two+ players. Some way to share short videos and pictures you’ve drawn on. 

You are alien naturalists, disguised as humans, capturing/documenting unseen fourth-dimensional animals that populate this planet.

What’re your names? What alien institution do you work for?

Mostly, blend into Earth society. But sometimes, discover a new specimen. Send a short video describing how, then a picture of the animal. You’ll have to draw; Earth cameras can’t capture the fourth dimension. Don’t forget a name!

Other players ask two questions each. Examples: What sound does it make? How’s it useful? How’s it cared for?

Amplify your magnificent discoveries. Downplay the significance of others’. Always tell the truth.

The other players write a report describing their impressions of your find. Homeworld’s watching, be honest. Include name, summary and rating (1-10), based on uniqueness and importance/usefulness of the animal.

Occasionally, ask for an update on a previous specimen. Check the rating. Five or less: they share a picture/video describing an unexpected talent/feature + a charming anecdote of bonding. Six or above: describe a complication/danger + the unfortunate way it was discovered.

Play until you’ve captured all the interesting creatures here. Destroy the planet as you leave.

## The Perfect Moment is Now

```
Required: Deck of Cards

Something is always messing with the time stream.  If it’s not scientists in strange contraptions, it’s teenage wizards with wyrd watches.

You are Time Wardens.  Devoted to maintaining the "correct" order of History. It’s your job to untangle time paradoxes.

Situation: Someone has interfered with History. 

Objective: Resolve the temporal interference.

Character creation: Assign 3, 5, 7, 9 uniquely to each attribute:

Hearts: Social.

Diamonds: Mind. 

Clubs: Strength.

Spades: Speed. 

Session start: Deal 5 cards face-up. This represents the next 5 Actions that should occur.

If a character wants to attempt an action that might fail, they must spend a face up card. If it can’t fail they succeed without spending a card.

After spending a card, discard and replace it.

Players must spend cards from left to right. Players can spend a card out of order, if they discard all face up cards.

The action fully succeeds if
the spent card’s suit matches the appropriate attribute 
and the number on the card is less than the skill rating. 
Partial success if only the first is true.

There is no turn order.

When the deck runs out the GM narrates whether History was maintained.


```
<hr> 

## SuperKid - a game for one adult and one child

```
You create a story about SuperKid, who saves a person/a city/the world from a villain/disaster/impending doom (decide each time you play). An adult is the GM, a child is the Player.

Together, write down at least 5 characters from your favourite movies, books or comic books. They will be SuperKid’s allies or otherwise relevant to the story. You can use them anytime you feel appropriate. 

Player chooses one SuperKid’s superpower.

GM narrates the story and creates Challenges, player declares SuperKid’s actions, how would she overcome Challenges, and asks questions about the situation. The GM then gives the Player a Task. If she completes the Task, SuperKid succeeds. If she fails, she may try again or you can help her.

Example Tasks: do 10 jumping jacks, spot 10 red cars, 7x8=?, capital of France, spell a word.

Example Challenges: enemies, monster, someone needs help, fire, water, earthquake, villain escapes, betrayal, unexpected obstacle.

After SuperKid completes her mission, Player can choose one new superpower.

Play to have fun. You are on SuperKid’s team, you both want her to succeed and overcome even the most difficult Challenges. Make the Tasks fun and engaging, but not too hard to complete.

## Heliophage

```
One night you have a dream in which you eat the Sun.
When you wake up, you discover you are now the most powerful being on Earth.
You are yourself. 
You can fly.
You can lift impossible weights.
You can move at supersonic speeds.
You are invulnerable.

What will you do? 

Set a goal.

2 - 5 players.
1 player is the Heliophage, everyone else is the World.
1dF per World player.

Heliophage says what they do. 
Nothing can stop them or harm them.

The World presents complications.
This is not a comic book world, this is the real world.
Real physics. 
Real politics. 
Real people. 

Real consequences.

Heliophage rolls the dice, assigns one to each complication.
“+” means positive outcome. Heliophage narrates.
“-” means negative outcome. World narrates.
“  “ means delayed outcome. World narrates. Next roll includes the delayed complication as well. No additional dice. Complications with no dice assigned have negative outcomes.

No other metahumans. 
No aliens.
No mad science.
No magic.

Just you, with the power to do what thou wilt, and a world powerless to stop you.

Play until the Heliophage attains their goal or gives up on it.

Heliophage narrates their epilogue.
The World narrates the aftermath.

The end.

## Tripping Over Yourself

```
The players function together as a single, very clumsy adventurer.

Pregame
Each player picks one or more of the following to control
8HP
  Left Arm
  Right Arm
10HP
  Left Leg
  Right Leg
15HP
  Head & Neck
20HP
  Torso & Center of Gravity
∞HP
  Mouth

Conflict Resolution (CR)
•Players want to do something
•GM and players argue over which limbs are involved
•Each involved limb rolls 2d6 individually
      ◦10+	resounding success
      ◦7-9	success
      ◦4-6	failure, Can Be Saved (CBS)
      ◦2-3	failure
•If CBS, another uninvolved (or minimally involved) limb can, within reason, roll to recover from failure, such as an arm grabbing a chair if the legs fail
•Player controlling multiple limbs? Roll for each
•In combat roll to succeed, then...
      Each limb that participates in attack / defense rolls 1d6 +weapon / +shield added together for final damage / defense
      Subtract defense from enemy damage for actual damage
      Any held object can give +weapon / +shield, it’s up to the GM

Every physical action, including walking, talking, opening doors, and grabbing objects, requires CR.

Limb HP
1+	Perfectly fine
0	Useless
-10	Chopped off

GM Combat
•Choose HP for enemy
•Roll 2d6 for success (>=6 is failure)
•Roll nd6 damage / defense, “n” depends on the enemy

## Racer

```
Racer is a game about fast cars, tight cloths & family.
You’re a racer in a family. Families pull heists and protect their turf.

Racers have three stats: Racin, Talkin & Family
To start split 13 points between your stats. Stats never exceed 10.

In Racer, everyone describes what they’re doing until you’re not sure who wins. 
When this happens roll a d10.  If the result is under your stat you succeed. The difference between your roll and your stat is your style. Style can be negative.

We talkin’ or we racin’?
Can’t tell if you’re talkin or racin? If your mouth is movin you’re talkin.
If your family has your back you may roll Family.

If the roll is opposed. Participants roll their stat. 
Results under the stat are successful, you don’t crash or embarrass yourself.
Highest Style wins. lowest roll breaks ties. Still tied? It’s a draw.
The winner raises or lowers one opponent's stat by one. Opponents aren’t always enemies.

Racers live fast knowing death lurks in every corner. The only way to hurt a racer is to hurt his family. If your Family reaches 0 you become an NPC.

End of game: Racers increase one stat by one.
```
<hr> 

## Playing Cards RPG

```
You are the Dealer. You can forge worlds, people, and timelines using nothing but a deck of cards (no jokers).

Forge Champions
Start by taking all of the face cards out of the deck. (You’ll shuffle them back in after chargen.)
Deal three cards to each player and have them assign each to one of the three attributes: Physique, Expertise, and Personality.

Each character beings with 1/2Physique+3 health points (round up). If hp<1 that character is dying. Resting restores 1hp.
Each character has skills/items equal to their Expertise.
Each character knows NPCs equal to their Personality.

Forge Adversaries
People, places, and paraphernalia will impede the characters. They have a difficulty of Easy (+2), Medium (+5), Hard (+9), and Impossible (+14), and 0-8hp.

Forge Trials
When characters act they test one ability. Reveal a card off the top of the deck. Add Difficulty. Subtract Ability. Their character succeeds if the result is ≤5. If the character fails by 5+, he takes 1 damage.

Beware Anomalies
Anomalies are events paradoxical to the universe. You know these as face cards. When you reveal one an Anomaly occurs.
The nature of anomalies, and any other rules, is up to you.

```
<hr> 

## Squamous

```
You are each eldritch abominations, taking human form for nefarious purposes.  Your human vessels are… weak.  Disgusting. Meat. Always sweating, defecating, desiring. How do humans tolerate this?


Each abomination has a secret eldritch Goal.  Write down a noun and a verb.  Give the noun to your left-hand player and the verb to your right-hand player.  Combine the noun and verb you receive for your Goal. Take 15 d6s. You succeed at your Goal when you have no dice.

Describe your human appearance and identity.


Each player has authority over a human Need. Things like hunger, hygiene, sexual desire, romance, social acceptance. Name yours.


Take turns framing scenes where you perform tasks to achieve your Goal. Other players roleplay NPCs, describe scenery, etc.  

When they describe how their Need complicates your task, they offer 2-5 dice.  Roll one die. 

If you roll higher than the number of offered dice, the Need causes problems. Take the offered dice.  

If you roll lower, you resist the urge. That player takes back their dice and the die you rolled.  

If you roll equal, then you succeed at your task even while still succumbing to the Need. Discard all rolled and offered dice.
```
<hr> 

## A walk in the park

```
Pick a breed of dog to enjoy a day out in the park all walked by the same dogwalker.

One person plays the dogwalker (GM) everyone else is a dog.

Each dog has three traits (rated 1-6) size, derp and speed. 
Max trait is 5. Size + Speed has a maximum of 6.
All traits have a base of 1. Players have six extra points to spend on traits.
Derp indicates the general adoring, but stupid, nature of a dog. It's the opposite of wisdom.
Each dog picks two secret goals (Eg get muddy, chase ducks) The Dogwalker approves them.

Tests are rolled against a d6, if the roll is lower than the trait it's a success. Task difficulty may give bonus/penalty. 

The Dogwalker starts by passing a stick to the player to their left and describing the scene that the dogs see.
That dog has the stick and describes what they try to do until they fail a test or complete a goal (getting a point). Other dogs wait their turn.
The stick is then passed to the next dog for their turn.

Once the stick has gone around four times total the points to decide who has won.

```

## Cryptozoo

```
People have become bored of lions and tigers. Zebras? Whatever. Gorillas? Pfft. The future of zoology is with weird creatures: Sasquatches, Death Worms, Chupacabra, Mothmen. Take your limited budget, track down the leads, and bag your zoo a headliner!

Cryptozoo requires four+ players, each with pencils and paper. You begin with $1000 each. The first player, selected randomly, writes down the name of a Cryptid. Other players [the Hunters] write down an environment and type of bait; these are their conjectures.

As a Hunter, you may Research, which costs money. To Research, you must first agree to a dollar amount with the Cryptid player, and then show them one of your conjectures. They react as they see fit. You can then alter your conjecture if you want. Continue until all Hunters are satisfied.

Reveal the Cryptid. Hunters debate the merits of their conjectures, and decide who most logically catches the Cryptid.

The Cryptid player and the successful Hunter split any money spent on Research.

The successful Hunter then picks a new Cryptid and play continues.

Go until your zoos are full, or your wallets are empty!﻿

## Blaze of Glory

```
Once, you were the greatest spy in the world. 

Now, you have been poisoned by your former employers, and you are about to die.

It’s time to get your revenge. It’s time to go out in a Blaze of Glory.

Agent and Employer each take one standard deck of playing cards. Aces low. 

Employer takes a card from their deck, looks at it, and plays it face down, narrating a challenge based on the suit (challenge type) and number (difficulty). 

Hearts: Social
Diamonds: Security
Spades: Environmental
Clubs: Combat

Agent takes three cards from their deck as their Hand. Each suit represents an Approach to the challenge. 

Hearts: Suave
Diamonds: Gadget
Spades: Stealthy
Clubs: Violent

Agent plays one card and narrates how they tackle the problem based on their Approach. 

Flip the challenge card. If Agent’s card is higher, they succeed, taking out one or more of their betrayers. If Agent’s card is lower, they succeed with difficulty and discard a number of cards from their deck equal to the difference between their card and the challenge. 

Employer continues by playing the next card.

After Agent plays their last card, they die in action, going out in a Blaze of Glory.

## The stars going out, one by one

```
As a group, decide the premise:

Everything is finished.  The Great Work was [completed]/[thwarted]/[abandoned] [long ago]/[during your lifetime]/[just now], and the Final Threat was [defeated]/[victorious]/[postponed].  You didn’t play a big role.  Now, all that’s left is your [solar system]/[space station]/[ship], and a rapidly shrinking light horizon.  The universe has [several generations]/[one generation]/[less than your natural lifespan] left.  Escape [is now]/[was always] impossible.

All characters/factions/places have an:

Attitude towards the end:  [denial]/[anger]/[bargaining]/[depression]/[acceptance]. Players can’t choose Acceptance.
Attachment:  [technology]/[cultural symbol]/[ordinary household item].  This Attachment is the last of its kind and irreplaceable.  There are no duplicates or sources of new Attachments except for other characters/factions/places.
Advantage or Disadvantage.

To resolve disputes:

Roll 1d6 vs the gm’s target number or an opposing character’s roll.  Everyone loses ties.
Relevant Advantage(s), another character helping, minor use of Attachment: +1d6, drop the lowest.
Relevant Disadvantages(s): +1d6, drop the highest.
Full use of attachment - reroll retroactively, or roll d10s.  Give up the Attachment forever.

Combat:
3 successful attacks makes a character helpless.
You cannot take an Attachment unless every Character defending it is helpless.

## The Dreaming Giant

```

A girl in a village is told by her grandmother a legend about how their whole world is actually the dream of a great giant, represented by a mountain silhouette in the distance. After the story is done, an earthquake takes place and some of the villagers disappear. She figures that it’s because the giant is waking up, effectively killing the dream. 
This prompts out protagonist to travel the world and collect stories from its inhabitants to go tell the sleeping giant to keep him from waking up. As she travels she encounters an array of characters, some who believe the legend, some who don’t.
 Collected stories can be used to solve puzzles and open doors along the way. 
As a final test, she finds the King of the land trying to wake up the giant for good, thinking it’s better like that than to live in someone else’s dream. The girl then has a choice, to help him wake the giant up or to stop him and let things stay as they are.

## Heisters

```
Four players are committing a heist.  Backstabbing is expected.

Equipment:
	* ~40 blank cards
	* Pens
	* d6

On four cards, write:
	* From who?
	* Steal what?
	* Where?
	* When?

Shuffle and deal. Clockwise, players write their answer. Arrange cards in the centre, face up.	

On separate cards, write:
	* 1st
	* 2nd
	* 3rd
	* 4th

Shuffle and deal.  Players describe an obstacle guarding the loot.  Arrange cards in the centre, in order, face up.  Repeat for 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, obstacles preventing escape, but arrange face down.

On two cards each, players name a beneficial skill.  No duplicates.  Shuffle and deal face up.  Equipment automatically accompanies skills.	

Each player writes two secret plans: an obstacle imposed upon one other player (they roll to avoid); or thematically prevent being incapacited (you roll to escape.)  Reveal at any time.

The team encounters obstacles in order.  Any player describes how they overcome the obstacle for the team, rolling d6.  To succeed, roll 3+ if skilled, or 5+ if unskilled.

The obstacle is overcome even if failed, but describe how you're incapacitated.  You can't act.  Create an obstacle someone else must overcome to save you.  Saving you is optional.	

Divide 60 points equally between players who escape.  Highest ongoing score wins.
```
<hr> 

## Diceless Deeds

```
Required: 1+ players, 1 GM. Pen and paper recommended.

Pick a name, four skill proficiencies and a handicap (suggestions are listed below).
Pick one of your skills to be your expertise.

 
Conflict resolution is done through a game of rock-paper-scissors (a 'check'). If you have a relevant skill proficiency you may re-take the check a 2nd time. Checks should only be made when failure has meaningful consequences.
 
You have a pool of 3 automatic successes, which you can use to pass checks where your expertise is relevant (they must be declared before making the check).

The automatic success pool is replenished by one (up to a maximum of three successes) whenever you fail a check that you had proficiency or expertise in.

You must succeed twice at a check if your handicap would be relevant (or once if you have a proficiency; automatic successes cannot be used).

Skill examples:
-Diplomacy
-Shooting
-Sneaking
-Athletics
-Wilderness survival
-Piloting

## The Ark

```
The Ark is old and adrift in a sea of stars. The would-be settlers have long forgotten the destination; now only know as the Promised Land. The Ark is feeble, life support systems are barely hanging on. The Ark is famished, clean water is life and food is used as currency. The Ark is broken, massive areas are now cold wastelands, toxic sludge seas or exposed to vacuum. The Ark is a maze, equipped with pipes and plastic shields, many adventurers have been lost searching for the Promised Land in the lower levels. The Ark is dangerous, the lower one goes the more dangerous and cold it gets. Malfunctioning maintenance robots, automated garbage furnaces, toxic sewage rivers, feral animals, sudden exposure to vacuum and sludge men, are some of the many dangers in the Ark. The Ark is populous, there are many communities scattered throughout. Some are able to trade with each other but most were isolated during the “accident”, they now have their own language and culture. The Ark is rich, some communities mine the ice shield that surrounds the Ark. But doing so let’s cosmic radiation in and can cause horrible mutations. The Ark is Home.

## Groove Crusaders

```
In a dystopian future the world has been deprived of all fun by the army of evil magicians know as the Haters. Banning all music and fun from the world, they overtake it in the name of boredom and general badness. But four legendary warriors have come together to combat the haters with four legendary instruments of the elements. Now they must travel the land to save the world from lethargy.

The game will be an RPG that mixes the menu combat of JRPGs with the funky grooves of rhythm games. Each party member will have their own instrument that has a dedicated face button, which they have to time with the music to perform an attack. Each attack increases the player’s score, wherein they need to reach a certain threshold to win the battle. When they win a battle they gain experience to level up which will increase the player’s score multiplier that make it easier to win harder battles with strict scores. It will also allow them to buy alternate weapons. These weapons act as modifiers that alter their score. These include changing note speed for increased scores, or pressing one button for any note that decreases score.

## Unanimous

```
Unanimous is played with 4 or more people. One person is The Overseer, and everyone else is a Survivor.

At the start of the game The Overseer describes The Situation, taking suggestions as desired. Pick something that is perilous but survivable.
Next is the Survivors’ turn. One at a time each Survivor flips a coin. Heads is hope, tails is tragedy.
Hope: describe how you find something important and how it helps.
Tragedy: describe another aspect of The Situation and how you try to fix it.

After they describe their contribution to The Situation the others vote. If they think the contribution was helpful to surviving they raise their hand. The Overseer may also vote.
Voting Survivors are unanimous: Success
Votes at least equal to voting Survivors: Success
Votes less than voting Survivors: Fail

After all Survivors have taken a challenge The Overseer continues to describe The Situation, and the challenges begin again.

If a Survivor fails three challenges they are dead and they are longer counted while voting, though their actions while alive still affect the group

To survive The Situation the group must have a number of successes equal to twice the number of living Survivors.

## Giant Monster Mayhem

```
Players each pick a role. Two must be a Kaiju and a Hero, use more roles for more players. More player than roles? Use multiple bystanders. Each role has a goal:

Kaiju - destruction and mayhem.
Army – slow down Kaiju
Bystanders – survive
Scientist – discover Kaiju’s weakness
Hero – defeat the Kaiju

To play: each round is a contest between the Kaiju and one other role. The Kaiju describes what they are doing and the other player narrates how they react.  A duel is held.  If the good guys win, the contest moves to the next role in the order listed above. If the Kaiju wins the process starts over from the top. The only way for the players to defeat the Kaiju is to win the final duel between the Hero and the Kaiju. The Kaiju wins if the other players give up.

To Duel – players simultaneously hold out 1-4 fingers. Total the count:
Odd total – Kaiju wins. Go back to the top of the conflict chain.
Even Total – Citizens win. If you are the Hero describe how the Kaiju is defeated. If you are not the Hero, play moves to the next contest.

## Of Light

```
The God of Light has weakened and Darkness surrounds you. Only you and a handful of believers can save Light from extinguishing.


Sit in a dark place.

Light a candle of any length. This flame is Light’s existence. If the flame goes out, Light perishes and you are consumed by Darkness.

Take turns proclaiming your feats in the name of Light by saying this phrase:

“By the [POWER] of Light, I [ACTION]”.

Replace the word [POWER] with words such as magnificence, glory, love or anything that shows your respect and devotion to Light. Once a word is used, write it down. No one can use a word already used before.

Replace the word [ACTION] with any feat you’d do for Light, such as “attacked the shadows of Darkness”, or “sang of Light's promise”.

After proclaiming your phrase, throw a die. The number you get is how many points of belief Light got from your phrase. Write it down.



Keep doing this until all of you collectively gather 100 belief points. At this point, Light is revitalized and will award the believer with the most points.

## Endless Descent: a game of Secrets and Hope

```
“Bring a guide,” cautioned the innkeep, but you knew better. A one-way door, a bad choice – and you became trapped in this endless dungeon, staggering onwards as you hope to escape. Has it been months? Years? Who even built this? With every room you’ll face monsters, traps, long-kept secrets, and your desperate dwindling hope.

SETUP
Describe your adventurer to the group: your capabilities, appearance, personality, needs, and flaws.

As a group, name and describe one party member who has died. Why did they matter?

Determine one secret about yourself and one about the adventurer on your right. Write them down, keep them secret.

PLAY
Take turns. Choose to reveal a secret or have a secret revealed about you; then jump forwards or backwards in time to describe a new dungeon room to explore. Describe combat, traps, temptations, supplies, or clues, but focus on party dynamics. End each scene after the secret is revealed and its ramifications roleplayed. What changed?

The game lasts 2 scenes per player.

ENDGAME
Reveal the final secret to end your explorations – whether through death, rescue, escape, or something else. If appropriate, go around the table one final time to describe your hero’s epilogue. 
```
<hr> 

## Asylum

```
You are a patient in Helgrim’s Home for the Criminally Insane. Your goal is to escape before Dr. Helgrim and his eight-legged orderlies can feed on you.
Your Sanity starts at 10. To interact with the Supernatural, such as casting a spell or banishing the demon Nurse Lilith back to her nest on the sixth floor, Overcome your Sanity by rolling above it on a 20 sided die. If you succeed, reduce your Sanity by 1.
To interact with the Mundane, such as picking the lock to your cell or convincing a fellow patient to give you his map, Test your Sanity by rolling below it. If you succeed, increase your Sanity by 1.
If you fail a roll, something happens to complicate your escape. Dr. Helgrim and his orderlies are after you!
The game ends if you escape the asylum or:
If your Sanity reaches 20: You’re “cured.” You can no longer interact with the Supernatural, but you'll never forget the things you saw.
If your Sanity reaches 1: You become enlightened. You can no longer interact with the Mundane, but you'll never forget where you came from.


```
<hr> 

## TROLLS

```
You are a troll: an under-the-bridge, ugly-as-sin, billy-goats-gruff troll.
 
Fortunately, you chose a bridge with a good wifi connection.
 
Make up an internet handle and write it down for everyone to see.
 
In secret, write down three physical aspects about which you, the troll, are extremely insecure. DO NOT draw on you, the player’s, insecurities.
 
The last troll to finish their list starts by stating their opinion on a topic, real or imaginary.
 
SPEAK ONLY IN TROLLSPEAK.
 
CALL CHARACTERS ONLY BY THEIR HANDLE.
 
IT IS YOUR JOB TO PURIFY THE INTERNET OF WRONGNESS.
 
DO THIS BY INSULTING OTHERS' LOOKS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE.
 
WHENEVER SOMEONE MENTIONS ONE OF YOUR ASPECTS, EVEN IF NOT AT YOU, YOU MUST RESPOND IMMEDIATELY.
 
NO PHYSICAL CONTACT WHATSOEVER.
 
If any troll thinks they have figured out someone else’s aspects, they can yell "BLOG POST", at which all other trolls must fall silent while the first enumerates those aspects.
 
If right, the attacked troll cannot blog post anymore. If wrong, the same happens to the attacker.
 
Play continues until only one troll can still blog.
 
End with a group pact "by the name of [winner's handle]" never to speak or write as you have just done.
```
<hr> 

## Symbiosis

```
You are all organs in a strange alien’s body. You’ll need at least three players. List an organ name, one feature, one purpose and two processes to achieve it. On squares of paper, devise at least two common problems an unusual alien might face in day-to-day life. Place these, folded up, in a bowl.

One at a time, draw a piece of paper and explain how you the organ will overcome this obstacle to the best of your abilities. If other organs agree with your methods, they will describe how they’ll help. If they don’t agree, antagonistic organs can interfere. The initial organ’s solution counts for 2 points, a helpful organ’s assistance counts for 1 point and a hindering organ’s obstruction counts for -1 point. If the organ scores more than zero, the process goes ahead and the body continues. 

If the organ’s solution is not suitable, an interfering organ may suggest a new solution and the other organs agree or disagree once more. The game continues until all problems are solved or the organs refuse to work together leading to total systemic failure.

## Magical Elemental Girls Excel!

```
The characters are magical girls, whose powers are based on chemical elements.
In their late teens, they form the state sponsored team for their home city.
Their college is next door to their HQ.
When not on duty or at college, public relations activities occur.

Character Generation
Write down three things about the character’s backstory.
Select their element and a signature item that relates to the element.
Choose the highlight colour of their uniform.
For each category below spread seven dots.
The signature item has one dot.

Attributes
Body, Mind and Soul

Skills
Four things the character is good at.  These are not powers.

Elemental Powers
Three magical powers granted by the element.

Mechanics
To act, combine one Attribute with one Skill and/or one Elemental Power. Add the Signature Item if it’s relevant. Dots become d6s rolled. 6s are successes. More successes add benefits. 1s add complications.
If the signature item rolls a 6, keep the success and roll again.

If the target of an action has more successes than the actor, then these count as 1s when determining the result. During danger, dots equal to the degree of success are lost as damage. The signature item is impervious.

## Trash Pandas

```
A heist game starring raccoons.

The Gear:
4 humans
20D6s + 1D6 (for Glitter)
A high-sided box

The Cast:
Ringo; clever - Shake the box after seeing the results.
Mittens; crafty - Your roll succeeds on 3+.
Porkbutt; big ‘un - Pick 2 numbers.
Glitter; wild - Roll for your number, that die counts. Keep it.

Start with Ringo and The Approach.

The Turn:
Put the dice in the box and SHAKE, but don’t peek. Pick a number from 1 to 6. Peek! Pull out matching dice. (If none match, tell your raccoon’s zany misadventure. Pass the Turn, but not the Phase.) Pass dice clockwise, giving 1 to each person until gone. Each rolls, on 4+, add a successful detail and return the die to the box. On a 3-, introduce a goofy complication and discard the die. 

Pass the box to any player. They start the next Phase. Continue until the Score, or all the dice are gone and you bust!

The Phases:
The Approach
The Opposition
The Twist
Plan B
The Score -  Everyone secretly picks a number and one SHAKES the box. Each match is a delectable treat for you! 

Scenarios:
#1: The Cat Flap, CATS!, Fishtank...
#2: Dumpster, Its Massive Bulk, Locked!

## At the End of the World

```
The world is ending. Why?

You are together. Maybe you’re the only people who knew it was happening, maybe you care about each other above anyone else, maybe you have nowhere else to go, maybe there’s another reason entirely.

Where did you live, before? What did you dream of? What do you want now? What’s your secret? How do you feel about the others? How do you feel about yourself?

Scene 1 - 7 days to go:

You’re on a beach together. What does it look like? 

You know now that there’s no hope. Are you angry? Scared? What have you lost? Will you comfort each other? Argue?

Scene 2 - 4 days to go:

You’re on a beach together. What does it look like? 

Do you give into despair? Try to give the others false hope? What do they need? What do you need?

Scene 3 - 1 day to go:

You’re on a beach together. What does it look like?  

Do you need to talk? Can you bear to be silent? This is the last chance to tell the truth.

Scene 4 - 1 minute to go:

(Set a timer)

You’re on a beach together. You say goodbye. Hold hands. Then silence.

## Catch the Thief

```
Catch the Thief is an RPG for three or more players and a GM.

The players are in a town surrounded by impenetrable mountain forests, with only one road out of the town. At some point, any one of the players may become the thief. The game ends when the thief leaves town or is caught.

Each player takes a pencil and a square grid sheet. They state their unique starting location, and write it in the middle of their own sheet. The GM secretly adds those locations randomly to their own sheet. Only the GM knows where the locations are relative to each other.

In turn, players state their location and either move North, South, East, West, or interact at the location.

If players interact, the GM creates the story with them.

If players move, the GM informs them, secretly or publicly, of their new location. This will be either a previously visited location or a new one. If new, the GM chooses what to  add to the map.

Throughout the game, players will track their locations, items, and stats on their sheet. And the GM will decide rewards, consequences, and what players must roll to succeed.

## River, Typhoon, Coursing River

```
You are a travelling warrior.

You are searching for something. What?

People describe you like an element. Which?

You have trained in a style. Which?

When you face opposition in your actions, you both roll six-sided dice, one each. Highest roll gets their will across. On tie the player wins. A helpful element or style gives you one extra die. A cool description of your action gives the player one extra die. Help or equipment lets you reroll one die. The more higher dice than the opponent, the better.

You may also spend Energy to gain extra dice. A player starts with 3 Energy and the Journeymaster starts with 12. Spent Energy goes to the opposition. You lose energy for every step you lose a trial. When you lose a trial with no energy left your journey ends.

The Journeymaster can spend on Energy to create an opponent or a trial harder than one die. Defeated opponents Energy returns to the Journeymaster unless given to a player. Opponents can only use their own Energy

When the Journeymaster has no Energy left the remaining Warriors find what they were searching for and their story ends.

## Kazooki Theatre

```
You’ll want at least five players, each with their own kazoo. Use of other musical instruments is at your own risk. Set yourselves in a circle.

Agree the starting situation and elect a starting player.

The starting player says one word to begin the story, the next player says the next word, and so on. Keep going round one word at a time.

If a player is stuck for a word, or if they want play to go faster, they can pick up their kazoo. From now on they no longer speak but can play their kazoo at any time in order to support the unfolding story (please try not to drown out the other players.) 

Each time a kazoo is picked up, the remaining players should aim to advance the plot and/or escalate the situation until only two players remain. The final pair should bring the story to a conclusion with the rest of the players providing dramatic musical support!

The two remaining speakers should then bring play to a close by speaking in turn the words “the end”. Then everyone should play a final musical flourish with their kazoos.

```
<hr> 

## Group Troop

```
The game starts with every player writing down a social group on a piece of paper. This can be anything, from "tango dancers" to "people who like white chocolate". Everyone picks a group note at random, and the game begins. From there everyone takes turns, starting with the oldest player present, stating a cliche or a trait they imagine people in their group share. So, if you've got tango dancers you might say "muscular calves", at which point anyone with a group who shares this trait repeats it, in this case that group might be football players. The game ends when each group has been identified and each group has matched traits with at least two other groups. 
```
<hr> 

## Pantheon: A Game for Narcissists

```
You are gods. Start with a creation myth and take turns telling your tales of glory, but be mindful of the rules of myth. When you're done playing, tell the story of your world's end.

The Ruler's word is law. Only an enemy would oppose it directly.
The Spouse always has the Ruler's ear. Whether toxic or wise, all words have their limits.
The Warrior always decides who lives and dies. Death is not the end.
The Reaper always knows the truth of things. The strands of fate are never cut by mortal blades.
The Trickster will always do as they please. 

When the gods war on the earth below, describe your champion and how they fail. When the gods fight in the heavens above, take sides and declare what you lose. When the end comes and the light fades from this world, describe your final hope for the future.
```
<hr> 

## An American Workplace

```
One player is the Boss. Everyone else is an Employee. Every 15 mins is considered one Workday in-game. The game ends after five Workdays, or a Workweek.

Employees start the Workweek with 10 Work Tokens. They need to have at least one Token by the end of the day, or they’re fired by corporate for not getting any work done. At the beginning of a new Workday, they get one new Token. Employees can only have 10 Tokens max.

The Boss is lonely and wants to be appreciated, usually by making bad jokes, performing magic, or pulling off some other crazy, usually inappropriate antics. Because of this, the Boss is distracting.

While the Boss is doing their thing, Employees have to keep a straight face—this means they’re working. Smiling, cringing, sighing, or laughing means that the Boss has successfully distracted them. When an Employee is successfully distracted, they lose one Work Token.

Some Employees might care about each other. They can give each other Tokens.

By the end of five Workdays (an hour and fifteen minutes), whoever still has Work Tokens wins and gets to relax for the weekend, knowing their job is safe.

… At least until Monday.
```
<hr> 

## Constitution

```
Set just after a revolution. It's time to build a new government. Elect a convention president to govern the process and ensure fairness. The convention president must designate a secretary to record the laws. Once the president gavels the convention to order, anyone can propose any law including laws to govern the convention itself. You must come out with a system of governance defining the creation of new laws, the execution of such laws, the arbitration of such laws as well as laws defining finance, foreign affairs, military matters, and human rights. These can be one person or many, republic or despot. You have ten months to define a government. Anytime a law proposed is passed in accordance with the rules of your convention, you may continue. Anytime a law is defeated in accordance with the rules of your convention, a month passes and the rabble comes closer to dispensing with you and instituting anarchy. At the end of ten months or the constitution, the president shall call for each area of government and the secretary shall read aloud the laws as stated. Upon completion of the reading, the convention votes to ratify or not. The decision must be unanimous.

## Limbo, the otherworld

```
You see the grim silhouette of a man pushing a pole in a mechanical rhythm. You realize you are on a boat roaming across a river towards a misty shore. You realize you have died…
When you get to the shore the ferryman (and so the GM) raises his hand silently. How do you pay him? 
The player must actually hand anything in his current possession to the GM or maybe run away, but there will be consequences.
The ferryman leaves you and the mists thicken up. You hear horrible screams and sounds. How do you hide? 
The player must actually try to hide wherever in the room – if the GM can see any part of him without moving but his head, he is caught by a slaver and is locked in a cage (under the table, in a closet, etc).
Repeat this to every player alone. If they cannot hide they will just pile up in their small cell. Now the players that escaped can explore the Limbo and its horrors, while the players that where caged will be performing slave’s tasks (preparing snacks for the GM, for example). Eventually they may find each other. 
Enjoy the Otherworld.

## Jumble Rumble

```
Two conjurers face-off in a deadly Summoner’s Duel. To win, summon jumbled up creatures to dominate those your opponent conjures.

Rules:

## A Single Point Of Reference

```
Ideally played by two people. 

Inside a big room the first treaty between an alien race and the human race is being negotiated. Outside, two people at the bottom of the hierarchy are sitting and waiting together. 

Player One: an alien who has learnt the language from text, but has no other references for the world. They must ask the other player(s) to explain things. 
Player Two: must describe what is being asked without relying on anything but the most basic definitions of things. 
Player One: can ask for clarifications on things if they feel Player Two is relying too much on assumed knowledge. 

Example questions:
What is the colour “burnt orange”?
What is family?
How does coffee taste?
What does lying in the sun feel like?
What is a cat and why would you want one in your house?
What is love?

Players should feel free to act out or use their surroundings, but the internet is not allowed. Playing in libraries encouraged.

Player 2 wins when Player 1 feels like they would understand the important aspects of whatever they asked. They don’t have to answer the question, though. 
```
<hr> 

## Monstrositea

```
You are a terrible and refined monster. This means you are monstrous in deed and aspect, but also attend tea parties.
Come up with a good name and title(s), along with three signature monstrous traits. Write them on a placecard and put it in front of you while playing.

This is to be played around a table with a cake or other suitable dish. Play begins when you slice the cake and ends when the group finishes with it. Other refreshments may be served, but do not keep time. For an alternate experience, play with a large pitcher of drink on a porch.

During tea, you have five basic moves that may be combined however you wish:
>Boast of your terrifying deeds
>Complicate the boasting of others with dramatic twists
>Smalltalk about the minutiae of your monstrous life
>Gossip about your friends and enemies
>Verbalize any monstrous actions taken that you, the player, cannot physically take

Once play ends, vote as a group on who was the Most Charming and who was the Most Terrible. In cases of ties, players share in these honors. 

```

## 3d13 via cards & introducing roll choice

```
A combat or skill resolution mechanic.

Each player draws 5 cards from a 52 card deck.  Anytime a ‘roll’ would be required, play 3 cards.  May choose 1, 2, or 3 cards from your hand before turning over the remainder from the deck.  Add the value of the cards displayed for a total between 3 and 39.  3’s and 39’s are criticals.    Draw back to a hand of 5.  Reshuffle discards when need a new draw.

Optional: may turn in a poker hand of 5 cards for a degree of epic success, being more epic the higher value of the poker hand.  Straight flush > 4 of a kind > full house > flush > straight > 3 of a kind.  2 pair and 1 pair are considered insufficiently awesome.

The GM should use a 2nd deck for monsters so that player and GM luck is balanced in separate pools.

An ace may be 1 or 11.   King = 13.  Queen = 12.  Jack = 11.  

Optional: Divide by 2 to map to 1d20.  Divide by 2 and discard kings to map to 3d6.

## PUPPY DAY: A happy game wherein everyone wins

```
You're visiting an animal rescue shelter to adopt a pet. Yey!

Sit in a circle.

Everybody writes a pet animal (e.g. kitten, dragon, goldfish) on a card. Put them in the circle face-up.

Everybody writes a pet quality (e.g. shy, one-eyed, clumsy) on a second card and keeps it--except the shortest player, who puts their quality card face-down in the circle and goes first.

On your turn, pick a face-up card and approach that animal's cage/pen/tank. The players on your left and right offer you their quality cards: take one. Describe the pet you meet. How does it greet you?

If this isn't the pet for you, tell us why and put the animal card back (but keep the quality card).

If you want this pet, keep the cards. Tell us how you will make it feel at home and leave the circle with your new friend.

The player without a quality card goes next.

If you're the last without a pet, take the remaining animal card and the face-down quality card. Tell us why your new friend makes you luckiest of all.

Everyone share your pets' names!

Player Roles:
Narrator: The referee tells the story and determines outcomes.  Fans: The other players. 

How to Play:
1. Create fans and figure out how they know each other.  
2. The Narrator sets up Part One, describing the convention and action and then giving each fan a scenario where they are the focus. 
The players and narrator tell a three-part story. Each character has one scenario per Part. Scenes take 5-10 minutes. 
3. In Part Two players describe the events of their scenario, but the narrator guides the story, adding complications and determining outcomes. 
If in doubt use a challenge of some kind (roll highest on 1d6, rock/paper/scissors, thumb war). Describe and move the story logically. 
4. In Part Three the narrator describes what happens to each fan. Players can demand challenges.
```
<hr> 

## Anxiety

```
This game is for one narrator and three to six players.

The narrator tells the story of a protagonist’s average day and divides the day into twice as many Events as there are players.  An Event is a minor daily action, like riding the bus or going to lunch.  As the narrator describes the protagonist going about their Events, players will take their turns, one player per Event, and every player gets two turns.

The game:
The narrator describes an Event in detail, then a player turn consists of the player giving voice to an errant thought, worry, or doubt the protagonist has.  After describing how this thought impairs the protagonist, the narrator and player each flip one coin.
    Two heads: the protagonist is unimpeded
    One head: the player describes how scared and weak the protagonist feels
    No heads: the player narrates the protagonist’s feelings and failings
The narrator adjusts the story going forward.  Repeat.

Continue until all players have had two turns.  The narrator then describes the fate of our protagonist.

Post game:
The players win; anxiety always wins.  Hug each other and go out for lunch.

## Word Wizards

```
One player is the Word Master, the rest are Word Wizards.
The Word Master will open ten random Wikipedia articles and create an adventure based on them.
Word Masters, don't feel restrained by the articles, they're your tools, some work well as settings, characters and items. Others serve to guide the tone and mood.
The Word Wizards open three Wikipedia articles each, these are your Magic Words. Use them to overcome obstacles that the Word Master presents to you.
If none of your Magic Words would be of use you can Word Dive by clicking on any linked Wikipedia article on your current words. 
Once you click, that is your new Magic Word and cannot go back, unless your current article has a link to a previous Word and you Word Dive again.
Every time you Word Dive you revive Word Drain. Mark it down. If you hit 10 Word Drain points you lose your Word Magic. 
The Word Master can also Word Dive, but doing so clears one point of Word Drain from all Word Wizards.
Conflict is resolved by each player opening up one random Wikipedia article, whichever title is higher in the alphabet wins the conflict.

## The Rapid and the Raging

```
Setup:
	3-6 players. Two index cards each.
	On one card write a city and its Problem. Something entrenched, like “Corrupt cops.”
	On the other card, write a character, their vehicle, and Problem. Something simple, like “Out of coffee.” 
	Characters start in First Gear.

On your turn: 
	Move your character to another player’s city. 
	Explain how you’ll solve a problem (yours or the city’s) the only way you know: with illegal street racing.  
	Race. 
		-The city’s player narrates the course and obstacles (using Problems as a guide). 
		-You narrate your driver. Other drivers in the city can race too, to aid you.
		-Narrate sick driving stunts appropriate to the gear you’re in: 
			--First: world-class. Navigate effortlessly; ramp off anything.
			--Second: effectively supernatural. Drive across water, up walls.
			--Third: physics-defying. Outrace bullets, plow through trains, fly. 
			--Fourth: magical. Become wind, control storms, drive through time.
			--Fifth: transcendental. Embody pure Driving.

		-When you’re ready to win the race, shift into the next higher gear and narrate your victory and its aftermath:
			--Gears 2-4: Solve the Problem, replacing it with a worse one. 
			--Fifth: Solve your Problem and the city’s outright.

Take turns in any order. 

Solve every problem. 

Celebrate your victories together.

## The killing action

```
A supplement for BlackHack-based games
Every character starts with a d20 Risk die. Every day the character kills a sentient humanoid creature they role the risk die.
The first time they fail they must choose the path of either Remorse or Hatred.
Once they have chosen a path, each time the risk die ticks down: Remorse, create a rule of behaviour around killing that justifies it in your character's mind, e.g. refuse to draw your sword first, pray for each of the souls you take; Hatred, choose one species you have killed since the last time your Risk die ticked down to join the creatures you hate, your character wages a genocidal war against their hated species, seeking to kill non-combatants, destroy settlements, poison water supplies and so on.
Once the risk die is exhausted: Remorse, the character retires from a life of violence; Hatred, the character is no longer interested in pursuing any goal except their hate and refuses to interact with those who don’t share their beliefs.

## One-Night Stand

```
You are two lovers. Think of a name; describe three good qualities you have and two you see in the other. They’ll be tested through play!

Describe yourself.

Describe a place where you can have sex. 

Remember: sex is consensual. Otherwise it’s rape.

Play five scenes: begin describing sex between the lovers. Choose a quality of your character, roll 1d4 and frame a flashback about it; the other player will describe how your quality is...

    1-real: this makes things significantly better;

    2-real: this makes things embarrassing.

    3-not real: this makes things worse;

    4-not real: this improves the situation;


You can cancel a roll and decide the outcome for yourself by burning one quality the other lover has seen in you. They decide which one and describe how they realize their mistake, during sex.

Flashback contents (scene order):

    1: how the lovers met (both roll);


    2-3: Why each lover decided to have a wild night out;


    4-5: Who each character is and what their life looks like.

After last flashback: describe how sex ends. If both lovers still have one of the qualities the other saw in them before, decide what to do next. If not, they will never meet again.  
```

## And then there were none

```
A short mystery/slasher game for up to ten players

We are trapped in an enclosed space. One of us wants to kill us.

All together, we first…
Discuss the era: medieval, Victorian, modern, sci-fi,…
Discuss the setting: isolated island, castle under siege, traveling boat or spaceship,…
Discuss the killer’s motive: revenge, justice, madness, hunger, intrigue,…

Each turn, each character still alive rolls a white d10.
Who gets the lowest result gets killed.

Each turn, each character murdered rolls a red d10.
Who gets the highest result narrates how the victim is killed and gain one point.
During the first round, the victim narrates.
Describe when, where and how. Establish the scene, add good details, and give some clues about the killer’s identity. Narrate the death: be gory, be horrific, be subtle.

If you want to influence who the killer is, you can give their player your red die to roll. You can change your mind at any moment.

When the last character is killed, who has the most points reveals themselves as the true killer. Obviously, they weren’t really dead. They narrate the epilogue, explain how they faked their death, and reveal their motive in details.

## The Filigree Prince

```
Players: 4-5
Roles: secret advisor (1), lovers (3-4)

## Escalation

```
ESCALATION
How far will you go to get what you want?

Two players control the same alter-ego.

Character Creation

Determine your desire

What do you want more than anything? 
What’s stopping you from getting it?

Choose your initial Humanity score: 3 - 5

All actions require a Humanity roll (1d6). To act with compassion, roll under your Humanity to succeed. To act ruthlessly, roll over your Humanity to succeed. Rolling equal to your Humanity fails.
 
After every action, move your Humanity up or down by 1 (min. 1 / max. 6).

Game Play

Escalation – Player 1 narrates what is happening until you must choose to act with compassion or ruthlessness.

Tough Choice – Player 2 chooses & makes a Humanity roll. The same player describes the outcome and decides whether to move your Humanity up or down.

The next turn, Player 2 escalates and Player 1 chooses.

The first escalation must tempt you to act ruthlessly by playing into your desire. The first tough choice must be to act ruthlessly and automatically succeeeds.

Play until your alter-ego has fulfilled his desire, alienated everyone, or is dead.

Epilogue

The higher your Humanity at the end of the game, the happier you are.

## Death by Chocolate

```
Requires: 
Game board and cards from the game Candyland
Piece representing each Child player.

Setup: 
Choose a player to be the murderous chocolate factory Owner. Other players are Children touring the factory. Each Child chooses a virtue and vice. Place pieces at Start.

Play:
The Owner describes each fantastical, candy-filled room of the factory and the deathtraps tailored to the Children's vices. The Children try to survive the rooms and escape the factory. The last Child left alive inherits the factory and lifelong nightmares.

Whenever a Child attempts something difficult/dangerous, they draw a card. If the card’s color matches their current space, they succeed.

If the card does not match their space, they may move forward to the next space of that color and succeed. 

If it's a double card, they must move forward two spaces of that color to succeed. 

If it's a location card, they may move to that location and succeed even if it is behind them. If they do, they also find an ally or item to help them.

If a Child draws a card and there aren’t enough spaces of that color ahead of them, they are killed in an ironic and candy-themed manner.

## Down the rabbit hole

```
A game for two players, who take turns playing the PC and the Narrator.

Shared PC creation: Age? Gender? Role? Hobby? Strength? Weakness? Some main friends/family/coworkers? 

Toss a coin to decide who goes first as Narrator.

Begin like Alice, following the rabbit down the rabbit hole into Wonderland, where the usual rules don’t apply. In Wonderland, the Narrator describes nonsense scenarios, which should include twisted elements of the PC’s real life, while the PC reacts/interacts. After five minutes, cut the scene, swap roles.

As Narrator, you don’t need to directly follow the previous scene, but build on what has gone before; remember to ramp up the tension and weirdness. (Remember the Red Queen: ‘Off with her head!’)

In the seventh scene everything builds up to a crisis, then just as it’s all about to go badly wrong, the PC wakes up in the real world. Swap roles one last time: Narrator describes a vestige of Wonderland which appears in the real world. End.

## Office Party

```

Six+ players
Boss is whoever brought the most booze. They pick two middle managers. Everyone else: Labor.

1st round: Gossip & Shots!: One shot for the boss, two for managers, three for labor. You take more shots the lower down you are to represent your powerlessness and need to drink. 

Everybody has a secret. What’s yours? Write it down, then roll 1d20. Compare rolls with the player to your left and your right. Higher roll gets the dirt and a favor(The Boss rerolls 1s & 20s and adds 2 to their roll)unless you roll…

1: You are shitfaced. Let your coworkers know what you really think of them.  Tell the boss off. Quit like a legend. (You’re out.)
OR
20: They did the thing. You have pictures.  You have a veto. 

2nd round: Team Building Exercise: Remaining players give favors to force shots or block them. No favors? Make the Boss laugh with a work story to gain one. Veto holders can accept or deny shots with impunity. 

Final Round: Hostile Takeover! Everyone rolls 1d20. Favors add +1, vetoes add +2. Highest roll joins the 1% and wins, everyone else gets laid off. Good Luck!

```
<hr> 

## Other Lives

```
Each player describes a person they saw on the street recently with one sentence of physical description, and one imagining who that person is. These descriptions are shuffled and each player receives the character they will be playing. Shuffle a deck of cards. Each player draws two cards and describes: 
Hearts: a need your character has.
Clubs: a sin your character has committed.
Diamonds: a significant item your characters possesses. 
Spades: a place your character has a relationship to.
Players can add more details to flesh out the story. All characters must have at least one connection with another character.
Play proceeds over the scope of a number of scenes equal to thrice the players. Starting with the first player, draw a card at the start of each scene. The suit will determine the center of conflict for the scene (need, sin, item, place). The other players then decide on which other character(s) should be in the scene. The story can skip forwards and backwards in time. After about two minutes of scene time, draw a card. A black card means the scene resolves favorably for the current player’s character, a red means it does not.

```
<hr> 

## Captain's Table

```
You are a sea/sky/starship captain at a dockside tavern.

Starting RESOURCES: three SKILLS, three SCARS, no SUPPLIES.

Each captain shares their story. Who (or what) are you? How did you become captain?

In turn, swap tales. Roll 2D6 against the captain to your left. Winner names a tale of your adventures: strange folk, dangerous creatures, hidden places. Loser chooses:

    FOLK: dynamic discoveries or fearsome foes
    CREATURES: fearsome foes or terrible treasures
    PLACES: terrible treasures or dynamic discoveries

Tell the tale together. Others prompt: "Is it true that...?"

For your tale of:

    DISCOVERIES: +1 SKILL
    FOES: +1 SCAR
    TREASURES: +1 SUPPLY

Continue until a captain says, "...and that's how I wound up here," gaining +1 RESOURCE. Other captains each tell another tale.

Recite your SKILLS, SCARS, and SUPPLIES.

Someone calls you a liar. A brawl looms.

Secretly select one ally, then reveal. Allies pool resources and act as one. If chosen captain doesn't reciprocate, take +2 SCARS and you are WOUNDED.

In turn, pick another captain to attack, rolling 2D6 <= SKILL. Hit captains roll 2D6 <= SCARS or are WOUNDED; if WOUNDED again, they DIE. Consuming a SUPPLY allows rerolling.

Those killed describe their fates. Winner tells tale of triumph.

## Game Cartridge Monsters

```
Friends in the late 1980s uncover dark monsters and must save their town. They discover that video game cartridges can be used to capture monsters! They scramble to build their own catching equipment and power suits and before the monsters take over! 

Need one deck of cards, but only 9 cards of each suit. 

Card values are irrelevant. Flip one card per turn. Make a column for each suit, with rows for each set of 3 collected. Record HP, XP, equipment built, and monsters captured.

Start at 20 HP and 0 XP. 

Every Heart heals 1 HP. 

XP (Diamonds) follows this structure:

1st-3rd collected: +1 XP
4th-6th +2 XP
7th-9th +3 XP

Parts (Clubs) structure:

After the 3rd part is collected, you build the PCC pocket cartridge catcher. 
6th: ESC entertainment system catcher
9th: SUPER super entertainment system catcher.

Monsters (Spades) structure:

1-3 Kawaii. 3 XP with a PCC will capture it. If not captured, -3 HP. 

4-6 S. Class. 5 XP with ESC. If not, -4.

7-9 Kaiju. 10 XP with SUPER. If not, -5. 

Catch a monster and you can plug its cartridge in to power up your suit! Track your high score!

## Long is the Way, and Hard

```
A Devil and Angel war for the soul of a Penitent undergoing five Trials on the path to Salvation . . . or Damnation.

Needed: 1 card deck, 10d6 each

NB: face cards = 11; ace = 12

Spread 5 cards (Trials) face-down. Deal 5 cards and 10 dice to everyone. Keep cards secret. Pass your highest card right and lowest left.

Introduce the characters and the nature of the pilgrimage---who, why, from/to where.

Contend. To influence the Penitent, the Angel and Devil play a card face-down. Wager dice (Influence). Reveal cards. Winner keeps their own Influence; loser gives 1, discards remainder.

The Trial. Penitent wagers Influence, then reveals 1 Trial. If the Penitent can’t beat it, 1 Influence goes to the Contend winner. Discard remainder. If win, 1 Influence from both Angel and Devil.

Resolve. Trial card suit determines scenario theme to resolve, win/fail:
Heart = empathy/generosity | callousness/pettiness
Spade = humility/piety | social conflict/hardship
Club = pacifism/de-escalation | physical conflict/hardship
Diamond = asceticism/conservation | materialism/gluttony

Judgment. The Penitent arrives and is judged (by whom?). Deal 5 cards face-down. The Penitent takes ALL Influence and rolls. Compare Influence total to card total. Resolve Judgment, flavored by Angel/Demon Influence.

## Fusion Dance

```
First, name your team of heroes. Then, write down your character’s name and personality. Distribute 7 points among your stats, which are FIGHT, STYLE, SMARTS, and CHARM.

Write down a power for your character, like pyrokinesis.

Pick a signature item, a weapon or tool.

When you take an action, the GM chooses a target number. Roll D6 equal to one of your skills, and count each 5 or 6. If you have equal to or more than the target number, you succeed. For each success above or below the target, use another adverb to describe the success or failure. Write conditions and wounds on your character sheet.

Fusion: Two willing characters can fuse. If this is the first time that combination has fused, create a new character sheet for their fusion. The fusion’s stats are the base character’s added together. Agree on a new personality, power and item that are a combination of the base character’s.

All of the fused players must agree on each action. If the fused players at any point can not agree, they unfuse. 

Whenever the GM offers fused characters two options, she may make them answer in secret. If they answer differently, they unfuse.

## A 5-day walkathon

```
You’re all wealthy, high class stars in a futuristic steampunk world where time is the ultimate luxury. In a world where everybody drives around on their steam powered unicycles, walking is the utmost display of wealth.     
 
Over the course of five real life days, players battle to reach the highest level of wealth that is in correlationto the amount of steps they make during that period. Every day the step count will be used as currency in a silent auction for “walking canes”, which have a value in points. 
1st and 2nd day - bronze cane (2 points)
3rd and 4th day - silver cane (3p)
5th day - gold cane (5p)

Prior to bidding, all players should tell a story about their journeys in the steam punky lands, what they saw, who they met etc. - so other bidders could estimate their competitors’ “wealth” and then bid accordingly.

Highest bid will be revealed and person whose it was will get the auctioneered cane. Winner loses the bidded steps, rest of the players won’t. Rinse and repeat until end of day five. In the end of the last auction, points will be summed up and person with the most points wins.

## Six Days Remain

```
You and your classmates are about to graduate from MAGIC COLLEGE. Decide on a name and major for your character. (Majors might include alchemy; divination; herbalism; daemonology; illusioncrafting; dungeoneering; cursebreaking; geomancy; and so on.)

As a group, pick six locations on campus and assign them the numbers 1-6. (Places on campus might include classrooms; dorms; the cafeteria; the student union; the bookstore; statues; fountains; distinctive-looking trees; sports fields; and so on.)

Graduation is in six days. Every day, roll 1d6, then visit the corresponding place on campus and reminisce about an experience you had there. Roll 1d6 again to determine how the memory makes you feel:

1 - resentful
2 - regretful
3 - wistful
4 - mirthful
5 - grateful
6 - hungry (or thirsty)

As you narrate the memory, be sure to talk about why it makes you feel this way.

If multiple people visit the same place on the same day, the experience is a shared one, narrated collectively by everyone there. (Different people might feel different things about the same memories. That’s okay.)

After graduation, narrate an EPILOGUE together. Discuss what you did after graduating and how your relationships with the others are today. Did everyone stay in touch?
```
<hr> 

## Love Language

```
You are a person. You have wants that you must pursue, fears you try to avoid, needs you must have meet, traumas that follow you, language you use to show love with, and a goal you need others to help you achieve.
Love Language requires 3 to 5 players, notecards, and a pencil.
The table chooses a Challenge. Then each player writes their character’s name, traits, and relationship to the other characters on a notecard.
Traits are:
Wants (if you achieve it 1 Check)
Needs (if you fill it 1 Check)
Fears (if you face it 1 Check)
Traumas (if you overcome it 1 Check)
Love language (how you show and receive love, if you speak or experience it 1 Check)
To complete a Challenge everyone needs to have at least 3 Checks.
After Character creation, go around the table framing scenes. You get Checks when someone frames a scene that deals with one of your traits. Continue framing scenes until everyone has 3 Checks or the table chooses to stop.
When you are ready to complete a Challenge frame a scene of all the characters completing it. When you are done epilogue your characters and their relationships.

## Turing Story Machine

```
**DESCRIPTION**

An abstract machine for generating stories.

**COMPONENTS**

A TAPE made of one or more CELLs (4-10 suggested), stores the fiction.

Each CELL (= index card), stores (=write down) a single story ELEMENT (character, location, etc). 

STATE (= token) is the current focus of the story. Can be set equal to (=place on) the ELEMENT in any CELL or BLANK, which is the empty ELEMENT.

HEAD (= token) is the narrator, always (placed) on a CELL, can perform the following OPERATIONS on that CELL: 

WRITE; change the CELL ELEMENT based on the STATE, narrate this transformation, set the STATE to BLANK. Writing to a BLANK CELL introduces a new ELEMENT to the story in that CELL. If the STATE is BLANK this is arbitrary. If you write a BLANK STATE to a CELL with a ELEMENT which is not BLANK, narrate an epilogue for this ELEMENT, set the CELL to BLANK.

READ; set the STATE to the CELL ELEMENT; narrate details about this ELEMENT.

MOVE; the HEAD to a new CELL, narrate thoughts, emotions or change in story direction.

**PROCEDURE**

Perform OPERATIONS with the HEAD. The TAPE and STATE begin BLANK. START with a WRITE. STOP when the TAPE is all BLANK again.
```
<hr> 

## Snitch

```
4-6 Players

One player is a cop who tries to arrest a mobster.
All other players are mobsters.

The cop rolls two four-sided die in secret for each mobster to determine how much evidence they have against each.

The cop takes a mobster into a separate room for interrogation. The other mobsters may plot together during interrogations.

The cop can disclose as much or as little information as they like and may lie.

Interrogated mobsters can:
Deny- if evidence against you is four or more, it goes up by one 

Take the fall- evidence against all other mobsters goes down by one, evidence against you goes up by three

Snitch- all evidence against you counts against a different mobster instead.

If at any time the evidence against a mobster is nine or more the cop can make an arrest.

The game ends when each mobster has been interrogated a maximum of three times or the cop makes an arrest.

If no arrest has been made the mobsters go free and they win the game

If a mobster is arrested he loses. However he can accuse another mobster of snitching on him and, if correct, the snitch loses as well.

```
Players: 4+; 1 as Story Master (SM), rest act as The Council.
Components Required: 6-sided Die (1D6)

Players represent The Council in the Hero’s mind. As the SM tells a tale, challenges will come up; The Council will have to decide how the Hero will react based upon the personalities they represent from the table below - overlap is okay. The Council must decide on two outcomes, assigning each one as either even or odd.

Once the outcomes have been assigned, The Council should discuss the options further and try to sway each other one way or another. After a few minutes, The SM will say “1, 2, 3 vote” and players will put out 1 or 2 fingers. The SM will count up the fingers determining if even or odd won and roll a 1D6 to see if the winning option succeeds. For each Council member that openly sided with the winning choice, the SM will add +1 to a die roll.

1D6                  Personality                                Outcome
1                       Self first                                     Overwhelming failure
2                       Puts others first                       Failure
3                       Money, money, money            Success
4                       Kill everything                          Success
5                       Nature is my friend                 Success
6                       Center of attention                 Success
7+                     -                                                 Overwhelming success

## Labrynith

```
You will need: 
3-6 people
A Chair
Approximately 10-feet of open space

The walls are dark yet ever changing.  You do not remember when you last saw the sun.  You cannot escape, but at least your life will be interesting.  Twice since you last ate the cloying smell of death has greeted your nose, but you could not find the bodies to scavenge for food.

Play in the dark.

One player (the ‘Hero’) is trying, and failing, to escape the Labyrinth.  All other players are the environment and hazards (the GMs).

To begin, the GMs form a circle around the Hero (seated in the chair)

The Hero will declare a direction. Whichever GM is standing closest to that direction will narrate the scene.  

The GM is trying to prompt the player to want to leave the scene.  Darkness, dampness, creeping horrors, crawling slimy things:  these are the GM’s tools.  Lean close, let the Hero feel your presence without touching.

At any time, the Hero may declare a direction to initiate a scene change, and a new GM will narrate what happens next.

Play ends once the all the GMs have had a turn, or the Hero meets an untimely fate.
```
<hr> 

## In Need

```
In order to play you’ll need two players and one six sided dice. One player is the loaner, the other is the client. 

Client: 
What does the shop look like? 
Why do you need money? 
What is the item you’re bringing? 

Roll 1d6 on the Value Table. Your item is worth this much according to you.

Value Table
1 - Worthless
2 - Cheap
3 - Common 
4 - Expensive
5 - Rare
6 - Inestimable 

Tell the story of how you acquired it. Where does it come from? What do you think it is? Why do you think it is worth that much?

Loaner:
Roll 1d6 on the Value Table. This is the real worth of the item.

You know the real story, origin and/or purpose of this item. What is it?
If the value is higher or lower than what the client rolled, explain why? 

Client: 
Decide what you do with the item.
Sell = Acquire as much as the value rolled by the loaner
Pawn = Get half of the value rolled by the loaner rounded down. 
Quit = Go back home with your item. 


How does your decision change the situation that brought you here? 

Both Players:
Switch places or end the game.
```
<hr> 

## Signed Away

```

Needs: deck of cards, paper, pens, 4+ people

You are warlocks, your souls contracted off to supernatural entities. Each player writes their name and draws the sigil of their patron at the top of their sheet of paper. Divide the rest into ten sections, in them write:
•	1 goal
•	3 ideals (+1 card each)
•	3 skills (±1 to any action)
•	3 relationships (ask GM for a piece of information once/day)
Cover three of these traits with your patron’s sigil. Covered traits (bonds) give you nothing. Each day draw number cards equal to your number of bonds + uncovered ideals. The GM draws a face card for the day’s obstacle; jack is mundane, queen is magical, king is either. Players decide on actions, then discard a card smaller than their number of bonds if helping their patron, or greater than if not. Ties succeed with a cost. If you do not or cannot succeed, cover another trait and succeed with your patron’s help. Each day consists of five actions.
Complete your goal before you are forced to sign it away and become your patron’s servant. Servants can continue to play but only act in their patron’s interests.

## Jersey Gore: a game for 4 or 6 players

```
You’re on one of them reality shows. Some guidos and Jersey girls. Some of you’s are vampires. 

You’re sitting opposite someone. Pick someone you’re into, and someone you’ve got beef with. Make sure your opposite picked one of them.

Start with one six sided die each.
 
Do whatever. Other players say how that affects them.

When your opposite is like, “Nah, you can’t just do that”, roll all your dice and check the highest:
-- 6: Boom, golden.
-- 4-5: You got it, but give someone a new die. 
-- 1-3: Sorry bro. Your opposite says what happens, and you pick up a die.

Once you’ve got 6 dice, your shit’s wrecked. Keep one, give 2 to one player next to you, 3 to the other. Your opposite gets to say what wrecked it.

Whenever someone gives you some dice, you caught some fallout. You gotta say how what they did affected you.

If you and someone smush, or they’re DTF (Down To Fang), give one of their dice to someone else.

When you take a sec with the crew and vent to the camera, lose one of your dice.

You win if your shit got wrecked fewer times than your opposite.
```
<hr> 

## The Dreamer

```
The goal of the game is to persuade the Dreamer out of their nightmare. If the Dreamer ceases to believe that you are part of the dream, you leave the dream. If they are Calm when you leave the dream, you succeed. If the Dreamer realizes they are in a dream or you run out of dice, they wake up and you remain, forever trapped inside.

You start with three six-sided Credibility Dice and the Dreamer in the Anxious state. The Dreamer has three emotional states: Frightened, Anxious, and Calm. Their state changes based on their immediate circumstances. If they are in danger, they are Frightened. If there is an impending--but not immediate--danger, they are Anxious. Once they feel safe, they become Calm. Attempting to convince the Dreamer of something extraordinary requires a dice roll. A roll of six or higher while they are Frightened or ten or higher while they are Anxious or Calm convinces them of your words. If they are Anxious and you roll under six, you unintentionally cause them to become Frightened. Rolling a four or lower at any time causes you to lose a credibility die, while rolling a twelve or higher gains you one.

## Normaleware

```
You’re an android infiltrating humanity, but you must obey Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics:
1.  Don’t let humans get hurt
2.  Obey humans unless it breaks the first law
3.  Defend yourself unless it breaks the other laws
Roll for your directive. You win when all androids achieve their objectives. The narrator determines success criteria.
1.  Love
2.  Respect
3.  Wealth
4.  Fame
5.  Power
6.  Trust
You have six programs in your matrix. Circle one from each category. After each scene you can change one.
1.  Empathize, Seduce, Coerce
2.  Build, Repair, Design
3.  Steal, Cheat, Bargain
4.  Perform, Gossip, Boast
5.  Pander, Blame, Promise
6.  Lie, Mitigate, Confide
For risky actions, roll twice on your program matrix. If either result supports your intent, you succeed. If neither does, but you accept the consequences, you earn data. You can also just fail. Roll thrice with advantage, once with disadvantage.
Data is used for rerolls. You can also reroll by giving the narrator bugs, used to make you reroll something. You start with 3 data and can store up to 10. You can give data to other androids.
If anyone discovers what you are, lose all data and reroll objective.

## Dance

```
Roll 1d6, mark that as your EXPRESSION.
Mark BLOCKED 0.

You start as a child, you go through: childhood, school, another school, early adulthood/college, later in life.

Now:
Find somewhere, where absolutely no one will see you. Find the music track that gives you strength and energy, and makes you want move and play it.
Start dancing. Forget what you know about dancing, just do what you feel. Random moves, silly moves, wild moves, whatever you body tells you.
Follow your body.

Now roll 1d6+BLOCKED. If you rolled higher or equal than your expression, something happened, select:
- your parent saw you dancing and told about it to someone else, they shared a laugh, it hurt
- someone told you, you can't dance
- you saw people dancing on TV and you heard that this is how people should dance
- someone walked in on you, and laughed
- something else - think of something, imagine it

You get +1 BLOCKED each time one of those happen.

Dance and roll for each phase you go through (at least 4 times)

If and when your BLOCKED is equal or higher to your EXPRESSION, you can't dance anymore. I am sorry.

## Anonymous Correspondence

```
A player writes down the following themes onto scrap pieces of paper:

Romance
Drama
Action
Horror
Comedy
Science Fiction
Thriller
Fantasy

These genres are placed into a hat. Each player draws one theme at random.

The player to have last written and posted a letter begins the game.

The first player begins by pretending to dictate some form of correspondence they have written to the player on their right. The first player creates a fictional character for the second player to role play as, a fictitious scenario and it must be written to match their theme drawn from the hat all within their dictated correspondence. The first player will sign the correspondence as "From Anonymous."

The second player does the same as the first but signs the letter off as the fictional character dictated by the player before them.

The last player will eventually assign a role to the first player.

Once players have been assigned their roles they must stay as that character for the remainder of the game.

This continues around the circle until the players have reached a satisfactory conclusion.

## Human-Zombie Fulfillment Symposium

```
This game is inspired by the song, “Re: Your Brains”. In it, humans have locked themselves inside a mall to escape zombies. The game centers on negotiations between the humans, who would prefer to keep their brains, and the zombies, who would prefer to eat those brains.  

To begin, players are evenly divided into zombies and humans. If there are an odd number of players, the extra player is a zombie. 

Players write the name of their character on an index card. If they are human, they write one skill or piece of equipment (e.g. scientist, flamethrower) that they have. If they are a zombie, they write one type of person or item (e.g. spouse, junk food) in their possession.

Each human player also writes down one demand that is specific to their character, such as seeing a loved one or consuming a rare food. If they are a zombie, they write the demand as “Your brains.” 

Characters meet and negotiate for 20 minutes, during which time no violence is allowed. When time is up, they either make the necessary exchanges, or return to their own sides of the barricades.

## Coin-cidence

```
The dragon's eye explodes as your hewn stone connects from 100 yards. On the ride back to town your horse gets spooked; you break your neck.  

THE GIST:
Players collaboratively tell a story.

Player 1, is a gamemaster.  Player 1 moderates the game by describing all the non-player elements such as plot and setting.

Players 2-N each invent characters that Player 1 weaves into the story.  Each player controls their character's actions in that story...while that character lives.

SETUP:
Player 1 describes a setting
Players 2-N each describe a character

GAMEPLAY:
Player 1 tells a story which includes the setting and other Players’ characters.  Player 1 describes everything except what the other players’ characters do.  During this story, the other players interject to describe the actions of their characters.  

If Player 1 wishes, they may subject any character action to a "test".  When this happens, the game pauses and a fair coin is flipped.  

Heads: critical success.  
Tails: critical failure.  
Player 1 interprets and describes that outcome.

No character may repeat an action that has been subjected to a “test”.

The game ends when the story is complete or until Player 2-N's characters are all dead.

## Thank You For Sharing

```
Friends are powerful, friends love things; make things; help you feel better about things. This game is about enthusiastic support and why we need it. 

Find one friend. One of you is Player A, one Player B.

Play: PA starts talking about [Thing] they like. 

PB: “I like the IDEA of [Thing] but…” 

PB complains about [Thing] for two minutes. Talk about how [Thing] disappointed you. Disliking [Thing] makes you feel better about yourself. It’s boring. You couldn’t get into it. The characters are too whiny. There are attitude issues you find repugnant. PB should feel uncomfortable with how mean they're being. Stay away from real reasons to dislike a thing, like racism or the money going to a shitlord in political office. 

PB, cool off. PA, write 200 words of anything: fiction, poetry, smut, fluff...

PA reads aloud to PB.

PB spends five minutes gushing about PA’s work; it's the best thing they’ve ever heard. It’s ok to shout “YOU MADE THIS? HOLY WTF ITS SO GOOD” If you’re both huggers, hug. Shout positively about how Player A’s work is amazing and makes you feel good.

Take time to discuss how you feel. Switch roles and repeat if desired.

## Flesh, and Other Inconvenient Things

```
Survive 30 days until the military arrives.
Each new day: Roll 3d6 and arrange them lowest to highest, corresponding to morning, midday, and night. That’s the number to roll to return home safely at that time of day.

Everyone takes an action and chooses to return home or not. Turns advance time. If night, you must return home.

You determine the difficulty of your actions (N), roll >N to succeed, otherwise fail. If you roll higher, you don’t get more stuff.

Bases = 10 starting HP.
Characters = 10 max HP, 0 = death.

Actions in base

## Caltrops

```
Requires: 2 players, 8d4, 20-60 minutes

You are two ninja masters. Your clans have sworn to destroy each other. It’s a caltrop battle!

You each have three ninja teams under your command:
 - Sword Ninjas: Strong; +1d4 vs. Shuriken Ninjas
 - Shuriken Ninjas: Ranged; +1d4 vs. Lotus Ninjas
 - Lotus Ninjas: Poisonous; +1d4 vs. Sword Ninjas

Secretly choose a team to attack your enemy. Both masters reveal their teams at the same time and determine how many caltrops to throw:
 - Standard Team: 1d4
 - Roleplay the clan war before revealing: +1d4
 - Advantage over enemy team: +1d4

Throw your caltrops to start the battle! Whoever rolled highest is the victor, and may describe the battle. The loser may narrate the death of one of their ninjas. The sole ninja in that team now rolls 2d4 as a base, according to the law of conservation of ninjutsu. Reroll any ties.

Any team that loses twice is destroyed. Battle until one master has no more ninjas. The defeated ninja master attacks the enemy's stronghold alone! Ninja masters roll 3d4 as a base, +1d4 for roleplay. They may reroll 1d4 for each ninja team still under their command. The winner of this battle is the ultimate ninja master!

## All it takes….

```
All it takes…. 
One roll 
One decision 
One sacrifice 
Space is dangerous. Not like in the movies, far worse than that. Humans can’t survive in a vacuum, it’s rather simple really. You were on a mission, on a spacecraft when something went wrong. Now your engines are out, rescue might be coming, but you only have enough oxygen for some of you to make it. 
To play 
Roll 1d6 and take on the character from the below list. If someone else has the role, re-roll until you get a role no one else has. 
1.	Doctor 
2.	Engineer 
3.	Pilot 
4.	Captain 
5.	Navigator 
6.	Communications officer 
As a group give your spacecraft a name 
Taking turns give your character a name, an identity. Pick one other player, describe why they would protect you. Pick a different player, describe why they would choose you to be the sacrifice. 
Each player takes a turn, arguing why they should be the one to be saved. Then each player takes another turn, arguing why someone else should be sacrificed. 
At the end, vote on who to sacrifice, when there is a majority decision the game ends, did you choose right?

## Laughter or a Lit Flame: A Hack of Renga

```
Here I have a game:
Paper, pens, and three players.
It's simple to play.

First Player writes a haiku
That describes a character.

Inspire love or hate.
Make us laugh. Or nod, silent.
Good haiku delights.

Player Two writes a waki,
(Two lines, both of seven beats).

Describe there events
That befall the character.
Tragic? Exciting?

Hide the haiku from our sight.
Fold it back or cover it.

The third player's turn?
Haiku of a character,
Waki-affected.

Now hide the waki from view.
It's player one's turn again.

On each turn, you write.
First respond to what you see,
Then hide what you saw.

Alternate. Haiku. Waki.
Maintain silence as you write.

Or else, talk of things
Unrelated to the game 
TV shows, your day.

Haikus invent the people:
Lives impacted by events.

Wakis are events
That change everything for
Our small poem-folk. 

When you’ve written five times each,
Reveal all and read aloud.

Whoever read then
Sits in silence. And so
Must the other two.

The silence can be broken
By laughter- or a lit flame.

## Tales from the Lost Kitchen

```
Go to a kitchen.

You are a group of people who live in the future. 
You have uncovered this kitchen. It belonged to your ancestors.
It is full of many things. You do not know what they are. 

How to play:

Take an item. Tell us what it is. 
Then, tell a tale of your ancestors. How did they use it? Why? 

Now it’s the next person’s turn. They have a choice.
They may either agree with the tale that has been told and the values it represents. If they do this, they take a new item, and tell another, consistent tale.
Or they may disagree. Then, they must take the same item and tell a new tale that reveals the truth.

Repeat this until you become weary of your forbearers. 

Then, come together and use the evidence you’ve established through your stories to describe your ancestors and confirm your collective history. The truth of your past is now revealed.

Leave the kitchen invigorated by your enlightenment.

Variant: Your ancestors had to flee this kitchen and leave. If they hadn’t, you wouldn’t be here today. This is what they left behind.

## Intergalactic Bake-Off!

```
You've been invited to the prestigious Intergalactic Bake-Off! Now is the time to showcase your unique baking abilities!

Each player starts with five tokens (coins). Next, each player creates six ingredients. These can be anything: the heart of a dying star, carefully crumbled plastic, grass-flavored chocolate, etc... Then determine the first player, who picks one ingredient from the list they didn't create. Continue going around until each ingredient has been chosen.

Fill out a recipe card as follows with an ingredient in each blank:

(1) Two cups __________
(2) One cup __________
(3) One tbsp __________
(4) Two tsp __________
(5) Dash of melted __________
(6) Sprinkle of ground ___________

Roll one six-sided die (1d6) to determine which ingredient horribly backfires. Give your recipe a name, then narrate how you make it at the contest, including the problem ingredient. Other players may give a token to the current narrator to sabotage their baking. The saboteur describes their treachery. The narrator rolls 1d6. On 1-3 the sabotage occurs and the saboteur takes back their token. On 4-6 the sabotage helps and the narrator describes how everything works out! The player with the most tokens at the end of the bake-off wins!

## The People You Meet On The Graveyard Shift

```
You work a dead-end job - shelf-stocker, burger-flipper, roadie. You're miserable, but you still hold on to something.

Tell everyone your job, tell them why you hate it, and tell them why you continue. Your name is optional.

You have three Traits - Hungry, Tired, and Poor. Each starts as a d8. Write down three things that are OK about life - these are your Holds.

Whenever one of your Traits come up, roll it. If you rolled a 3-, reduce that Trait's die by one step. If you rolled a 6+, tell everyone how that Trait screws you over, and increase that trait's die by one step - if it's a d12, treat the roll as a 9+ instead.

If you rolled a 9+, cross out a Hold. If all of your Holds are crossed out, you leave the game - commit suicide, go postal, whatever.

If a Trait would be reduced below a d4, remove it from your character. Whenever someone reaches out to you, you can replace a crossed-out Hold - this can be good or bad.

---

One player is the Boss - they describe the world, and should be cruel to the other players. They don’t have Traits or Holds, and never roll.

## Space Debris - A Chore-Playing Game for Two

```
After a disaster on your Orbiter….
You play the Walker. Spin fast for 20 seconds. Pick up a bag of garbage to take out to the curb; you are carrying a part of the payload needed to repair your Escape Pod. When you walk on the driveway, close your eyes; you are falling into space. You must only walk slowly, holding your breath unless you can grab something permanent. ( house, tree, car, etc ). Another player is the Watcher, who watches from a window inside the home, giving directions to the Walker via cell phones. You can only talk to the Watcher when holding on to something.

During the walk, when the Watcher sees:
Pets or children...discuss your loved ones on Earth.
Adults...discuss your dead comrades.
Car driving by….ASTEROID SHOWER, you spin wildly until dizzy.

If you take a breath without holding on to something, you become disabled and cannot move or talk. The Watcher must now enter space, walking slowly, holding their breath and eyes closed. If the Watcher touches you, you are revived, and the Watcher returns to the window. If the Watcher takes a breath beforehand, you both die in space.

## Bloodfeud – Diplomacy with Vampire

```
You're bloodsucking leeches with grand aspirations but there's never enough to go around.

Everyone divide 15 points between Blood and Clout. Define two traits: major/minor (worth +2/+1 respectively, each takes a night to refresh after use).

There's a communal pool, The Hunt, which starts empty. Vampire hunters are nasty business.

Each night connive and socialise with the others, trading resources freely, then take one action (revealed and resolved simultaneously); adding trait bonuses fitting the narrative and choosing applicable targets. You may aid others with your traits.

Feed: Gain 1 Blood. If half or more Feed, each adds 1 to The Hunt.
Conflict: Roll*. Target may change actions to oppose. Multiple parties can participate. Highest success steals 2 points, victor's choice. Add 1 to The Hunt.
Undermine: Roll*. Success steals 1 Clout.
Reign: Roll*. Success negates all actions against you.

Unless you Feed, lose 1 Blood.

Repeat each night until one remains.

If Blood reaches 0 you wither and die. If The Hunt hits 10, everyone gets staked.

*Roll: 1d10 equal-or-under Clout+Bonuses to succeed. If you roll equal-or-under The Hunt you've been confronted by hunters, spend Clout point-for-point to reduce The Hunt below your roll to avoid death.

## Adfectomancer

```
You've come a long way to obtain your power. But now you're alone.
Perhaps you can use your magic to bring back an old friend?
You are the Adfectomancer, and there's nothing the human mind can possibly hide from you.

Focus on the person you desire to summon, and visualize an event you remember with fondess about the two of you. You’re going to shape the past.
Think of 3 different ways it could have ended differently, and complete each sequence in your mind until you reach a satisfactory check point.

During your divination stay focused and check:
• You gain a +Mantra for every positive change.
• You gain a –Mantra for every negative consequence.
• A -Mantra cancels a +Mantra. Add up.

At the end of every divination, you can complete one ritual.
Roll a d6 +1d6 for every +Mantra:
• If you score at least one 6, you gain 1 Karma.
Repeat until you have 3 Karma.

Now pick up your preferred method of communication, be it a phone or something else. Indulge no more and complete the spell without fear.

## Gambling on the River Styx

```
To cross the river Styx, you owe Charon two pennies.  Penniless ghosts play mahjong on the riverbank to win passage.


Place a skeleton nearby. That’s Charon, waiting for you. 

Place six matching pairs of coins into a bag.  Pass the bag around. When you get the bag, draw one coin and explain why you fear the afterlife.  If your coin matches a coin you already have, instead return it and don’t explain. Repeat until the bag empties.

Place the mahjong tiles in the bag.  Each player draws five tiles.  

Each round, everyone antes a coin into the pot. Draw one tile.  Play one tile. Reveal simultaneously.

The highest numbered tile wins the pot. The winner recalls a memory of their life, based on suit:
-Dots: selfishness
-Bamboo: cruelty
-Characters: tragic mistakes

Ties: Split the pot evenly (randomly), leaving the remainder in the pot.  Include the other tied players in your memory.

If you play a un-numbered tile, you lose the round. Tell a story about redemption.

If you ever match a pair of coins, you must approach Charon and cross to your afterlife. None know what comes after.

If you have no coins, you shiver on the riverbank for eternity.

## Ashes of the Sun

```
You were once companions Commander Sun, captain of the Dunkirk-SR3 and hero of the Xanar War. She sacrificed herself to repel the alien machines and banish them from our galaxy. Each of you played your part and helped her save humanity. Ten years later, each of you hear a rumour that Sun has been found on some distant outpost, deep in Xanar space. Now you come together for one last mission.
*Introduce your Companions*
1) Name your companion
2) Tell us what you used to be. 
3) Tell us how most people now see you? 
4) Tell us what do you hope to become? 
5) Tell us the nicknames two other companions earned.
*The Rules*
One of the companions was Sun’s lover. They describe the first scene, and ask one question of another companion. After answering, that person asks someone else another question. Each scene ends when a companion cannot answer a question.  
*The Mission*
Describe your voyage to reclaim the Dunkirk SR3 from the shipbreakers, searching for information on the pirate outpost of Scourge Station and navigating through the Ysarl blockade. Once you reach the Sun, describe how she has changed. Together, decide if you will bring her home.   
```

## Hopeless

```
You’ve been kidnapped. Introduce yourselves. 

Objective: Find the key and Escape.

The GM draws the map of the captors’ house, positions the captors and key.The house doesn’t change, but the captors’ and key positions will change every day.

Decide via D20.

Take turns to explore, only one person per night. 
Hear noises by asking your GM.

When you’re alone, you have the chance to become insane without emotional support from the group.
You have 5 minutes to explore before you die of insanity
While exploring, only you can grab a piece of paper and layout the map as you discover it.

If you end up in the same room with a captor, turn on a metronome, sync breath with the beat, if you fail, you get discovered. Go from 60BPS to 110BPS gradually.
You get nervous, your sanity won’t last long.
Light a match. It represents your mental sanity for that moment. 
The GM throws a dice. Get a number >= while syncing breath before the match runs out or you’ll be spotted. 
If you succeed, go back your normal timer.
If you die, explain the cause and express an emotion you felt before death in one word.

## Dungeon Black

```
Dungeon Black is a two player roleplaying game about a group's inexorable descent into darkness, madness, and death. 

The Shadow is the game master, the darkness that will encroach upon the flame.

The Player acts as the Delvers, a group of four ill-fated characters. They could be a band of survivors during an apocalypse, a group of highschoolers hounded by a slasher, or a company of would-be adventurers, descending into an ancient ruin. 

Each Delver is defined by a single noun, describing the type of situation the character is good at overcoming.

The Player must divide 7 six-sided dice among the Delvers. A Player rolls all of a Delver’s dice to overcome a difficult a task; they succeed unless a 1 is rolled. If a 1 is rolled, that die is removed from the game. A Delver with no dice is dead, mad, or otherwise lost.

The Player also has a tea-candle and a pile of five matches. A match may be spent by lighting it in the candle; this allows the Player to re-roll a single Delver’s roll.

The Shadow may allow the Delvers to find items or characters that grant more matches or dice.

## Prime Directive: a game of not screwing up

```
Players expand on parts from the script in sequence. Roll a die to pick terms from lists. 

XO: 
Our Journey has been (Damaging, Tiring, Expensive, Deadly, Uneventful, Relaxing) but, we’re here now. Warp-out in 3... 2... 1...
 
Navigator: 
Orbit established. Telescopes show a (Tidally-locked, Earth-like, Unstable, Cavernous, Small, Gas Giant) planet.

Ops: 
Sensors indicate a (Hostile, Intermittently Breathable, Thin, Breathable, High Oxygen, Thick) atmosphere and a (Silicon, Incompatible, Semi-compatible, Compatible, Terraformed, Semi-Terraformed) Biosphere.

Communications: 
Transmissions suggest a (Decimated, Scattered, Divided*, Hybrid*, Large, Ascended) Population. 
Their culture is (Modernist, Cyber-Punk, Militaristic, Neo-Soviet, Neo-Victorian, Trans-Humanist) 
with a (Pan-African, Middle-Eastern, South-American, East-Asian, Euro-American, South-Asian) aesthetic.

Councilor: 
Compared to us they seem (Xenophobic, Advanced, Parochial, Dynamic, Primitive, Xenophilic). 
Their political system is (Theocratic, Egalitarian, Feudal, Democratic, Technocratic, Authoritarian), 
while their economy is (Forage, Pastoral, Agriculture, Industry, Bio-engineering, Space) based. 

Captain: Well done people. 

Players discuss proposals for first contact and trade. Eventually the Captain choses one proposal and each crewperson rolls a die; secretly adding or subtracting one. If the total is less than four times the number of players the mission is a failure. The player with the best explanation for the failure is the next Captain.   
* roll twice on subsequent lists

## A last drink

```
Sit down across from your friend with a few mutually appreciated beverages between you.  You each have a pint glass and a shot glass.

Greet your friend and explain why it's been too long since you last spoke. As you reminisce about your last encounter, pour the liquid into your old confidant's pint glass.  Both pint glasses filled, come to understand why it's been so long since you last spoke, then nod.  When you've come to an understanding, remove all but one bottle from the table.

You must speak before each sip.  Tell your partner a story of their life.  Clarify a story you've been told about your own.  Grieve for a  lost accomplice.  Imagine where you thought you'd be.

When your partner's drink is drunk, pour them a final shot.

You don't need to tell one another that your chat together might be your last.  You both know.  That shot will be your final drink together.

You may not speak after your pint glass is empty, except to ask your partner to pour you another round.

If you are asked to pour another round, refuse.

When you wish to end the night, nod.  

When you are both ready, hug.

## RPG - Random Parable Generator

```
A Storytelling Game for Three Players

One player takes the role of Narrator.

Another takes the role of the Protagonist.

The final player is the Mediator.

The Narrator chooses the kind of story they want to tell (a grand adventure, a simple day at work, etc.), the Protagonist creates who they will be (a Princess, a Pirate, or even just themselves), and the Mediator creates a setting for things to take place in. This can be done separately (and secretly), collectively as a group, or sequentially.

The Narrator may then begin to tell the story. The Protagonist may be called on to act, or they may choose to do so on their own. If at any time the Protagonist decides to disobey the Narrator’s directions or attempt to change the story, the Mediator chooses a number between 1 and 20 and all three roll a d20. The closest roll determines who gets to decide the outcome of the event, and the Mediator is free to choose neither side’s idea, instead inserting their own.

Play continues until the story is completed to everyone’s satisfaction and/or when the Protagonist is well and truly dead.

## Relentless

```
Gather 10d6, a sheet of paper, and 4 friends.

Characters are Slaves with Hope: a shared goal that they WILL achieve to end the game. Write the Hope large so that it is always visible to all players. 

Slaves begin trapped in cages. When Players describe an action, the Facilitator may call for that Slave to roll. 

Slaves cannot own anything, even dice. They use a communal Pile of d6s equal to the Scene (beginning at 1). If the Slave fails to roll a 6, the roll fails, and 1d6 is added to the Pile, up to a maximum of 10d6. If the Slave succeeds, the Facilitator sets the next scene, and (regardless of any previous failures) the Pile resets to the number of the new scene (2d6 for 2nd scene, etc).

In 10th Scene (10d6), conflicts represent the Slave attaining their final step toward Hope. Once only one Slave remains to take part in conflicts, the stakes are Hope itself. Failure will introduce a twist and a new opportunity to reach for Hope. 

Once Hope is attained, allow each player an epilogue, describing their Slave’s future. This serves to both decompress and reward them for their endurance.

## A House Is Not a Home

```
You and a companion play family members having a horrible fight about a third relative. You’ll pace and direct the fight through building a house of cards.  Lean pairs of cards against each other to make triangles, and place cards across pairs of triangles to build bridges.

Angriest starts the argument, and builds the first triangle. Then alternate, building a new triangle or a bridge.  Build new triangles next to old ones so a bridge can be laid across them, or on a bridge to start a new layer.

As you build a triangle: insist, blame, harden.  If this also starts a new layer: insult, threaten, escalate.

As you build a bridge: empathize, reconsider, soften. 

The argument ends when one player gives in, both agree to stop fighting, or the house collapses.  

Then begin an epilogue conversation, sometime later, at a family gathering in honor of your relative.

If the house did not collapse, your relationship endured.

If the house collapsed, but only partially, it’s the first time you’ve really spoken since the fight.

If the house collapsed completely, whoever placed the last card died sometime before the gathering, before you could make peace.  Nevertheless, hold the conversation.

## The Marketers

```
You are marketers, trying to sell products presented by your President of Marketing, and add them to your portfolio. The game is played with 3-6 marketers. The first marketer to add 5 projects to their portfolio wins the game.

Each round, one marketer will serve as President of Marketing. The President has 10 six-sided funding die at the start of each round. The President will make up a ridiculous product, and the marketers must come up with a strategy to sell it. The marketers are encouraged to ask questions about the product, such as who makes it, what does it taste like, etc.

Each time a marketer pitches a good, funny, or ridiculous idea for the product’s marketing, the president can reward them a funding die. Other marketeers build off this pitch, adding to the overall marketing strategy.

When all the funding has been passed out, each marketer rolls their funding dice, to see how much profit their ideas contributed. The player that rolls the highest gets to add the project to their portfolio; ties go to the marketer with the most funding die.

If no-one has won, the marketer to the President’s right becomes the next President.

## A.C.E: A Deadly Game of Espionage

```
You are an agent of ACE (Assassination, Counterintelligence, & Espionage) on a mission that could define the fate of the world. You have been chasing your target for too long, and you are in too deep, but it all ends tonight.

Choose a role: the Agent or the Mastermind. The Agent describes the mission (what are they stopping the Mastermind from doing), and the Mastermind describes the method (how they will accomplish their plan). When the scene is set, shuffle a deck of cards, deal 5 cards to each player and set the deck face down in the center of the table. 

Flip the top card of the deck face up: if the card is red, high card wins, if black, low card wins. Matching color wins ties. 

Each player selects a card in their hand, or may ‘improvise’ and take the top card of the deck (remaining face down).

When ready, players reveal their cards. The winner of the round describes how they have succeeded in outwitting their opponent (an improvised move should be reflected in the scene), and a new round begins. 

When a player has won 3 rounds, play a final scene describing their victory.

## Rule of 3 Digits

```
Write your character concept.
Roll 3d10 to generate the 3 digits for your character.
Think of a name, write it, and you are ready to go!

The game begins with your 3 digits being unlocked
The GM describes the environment.
You describe what you are doing.
The GM will give you a binary choice and you make a decision.
Some decisions will require a check.
If a check is required, choose one of your unlocked digits. A digit value of 0 counts as a 10. 
If all digits are locked then the result is 1.
If your character concept would help then add +2 to the result.
Digits can be added together as long as the final total doesn’t exceed 10.
Reveal your result and the GM will describe the outcome.
Digits just used become locked and unusable for the next check, and any previously locked digits are unlocked.
When making a check, a value of 1 to 5 is a failure and a 6 to 10 is a success.
It takes two failures to lead to death.
Outcomes can include rewards.
Rewards are worth a +3 to checks if applicable to the situation.
```
<hr> 

## Duel of Change

```
2 players and a judge(s)

You need: 10 coins of same denomination and different years of minting

You are two SUPER POWERFUL SHAPESHIFTING WIZARDS. You hate each other.

Flip a coin to determine who goes first. Divide the ten coins evenly between the wizards. They then pocket the coins.

The starting player will draw a coin from their pocket. The final 2 digits in the year of minting determines which shape you shift into- pick from the list below with the two digits you have

1 Insect
2 Mouse
3 Sparrow
4 Ferret
5 Cat
6 Wolf
7 Eagle
8 Stallion
9 Bull
0 Elephant

Narrate which shape you shift into, and how you’ll defeat the opponent. Wizard 2 then does the same with a coin from their pocket, narrating how they defeat player one’s shape with their new shape.

Judge(s) then pick a winner based on narration. Discard coins, then Player 2 begins round 2 by drawing a new coin from their pocket and shapeshifting. Alternate who goes first each round. 

When no coins remain, winner of the most rounds wins and shapeshifts into a Dragon.

For added fun, do it in verse with a rap beat.

## The King and its Mute Jesters

```
The Mute Jesters are to deliver news to the King in place of the Court Advisor, fearing that the news would bring about the wrath of the King. The Jesters are there to deliver the news in a light-hearted fashion to avoid King’s wrath.

***
The Game
1 person as the Court Advisor who will write a set of words on paper(s), reveal each word only to the Jester during play.
Minimum 2 Mute Jesters who will translate the words written by Court Advisor to the King with hand/body gestures.
1 person as the King who will attempt to guess the answer gestured by the Mute Jesters.

The Jesters that managed to get the most answers from the King under 1 minute wins the round.

If you’re up for it, Jesters can combine string of words to form a sentence cooperatively together.

Rules/Notes
Each Jester has 1 minute to get the King to answer as much as possible.
The King can be a different person for each Jester.
Write at least 10 set of words/short sentences per Jester.
Players are allowed to suggest a theme before starting for the set of words to be written and played.
```
<hr> 

## In the Cards

```
Needed: 1 Deck of Playing Cards (no Jokers)

At the same time all players will contribute to the setting and scene of the Story with a single word.
One player in the group chooses the story's location (Ancient Greece, Space Station, etc)
One player chooses an object of interest (Vase, Computer Core, etc)
One player chooses the action (Steal, Discover, Protect, etc)
One player chooses the hurdle (Cursed, No Time, Enemy, etc)

Each player then defines their character with a single word description (Mystic, Engineer, Diplomat, etc) and a single word motive (Boredom, Honour, Greed, etc)

As players work together to unfold the story important or pivotal actions are resolved by going to the Deck of Cards. The protagonist draws a card from the deck and so does another player. The resulting two cards determine success or failure.

Two Black Cards = Failure
Two Red Cards = Success
One Red/Black = Mixed Results 

If during the draw a Face Card appears something wildly unexpected happens! If it is positive the protagonist describes what that is. If it is negative the group decides. On a mixed result the colour of the face card determines the nature of the twist.

## The Heist

```
Materials:  shade tokens, evidence tokens.

One player is GM, the rest are Criminals planning a big heist.

Phase one:

*  Each Criminal declares a specialty; collects 3 shade tokens.

*  Criminals draw a map together, each notes one obstacle they will overcome with their specialty.

*  GM secretly writes one complication per Criminal.

Phase two:

*  GM chooses an obstacle to resolve.  Criminal describes how they attempt to overcome.  Have a GvC Conflict.

*  GM may introduce written complications at any time.  Have a GvC Conflict to resolve.

Phase three:

*  One Criminal picks up The Loot.  Only one Criminal can hold The Loot.  Others may CvC to gain control of The Loot at any time.

*  GM challenges each Criminal to describe their getaway.  Have GvC Conflicts, but GM gets +1 for each evidence token on the Criminal.  Failure means Criminal is arrested.  If the Criminal with The Loot is arrested, GM immediately wins.

*  Any Criminals left win!

Conflicts:

*  GvC = GM vs Criminal; CvC = Criminal vs Criminal

*  Both parties roll 1D6, highest roll wins.

*  Before rolling, other Criminals can give a single shade to GM or Criminal to +1 that roll.  (Criminals exchange shade; GM discards.)

*  Each time a Criminal fails, they gain an evidence token.

## Coloring Outside the Lines of Reality

```
You are all-powerful, multi-dimensional children, playing pretend with your favorite reality.

There is no GM and players control a fantasized version of themselves. Each player starts with 3 “nuh-uh!” tokens. 

Agree on a genre or situation. Decide randomly who takes the first “turn.” The turn-taker has narrative control. They frame a scene and define each player as a specific character in it. The turn-taker MUST start the scene by saying “pretend [X happens].” At any time, the turn-taker can end their turn and the player to their left goes next.

When a player narrates an event, no other player can deny it happened without a “nuh-uh” token. You can change or escalate the conflict. The sky’s the limit! Go over the top. Mix genres. Channel your inner eight-year-old.

A player can deny a narration by spending a “nuh-uh!” token. You MUST say “nuh-uh! That’s not what happens!” Then narrate what ACTUALLY happens. Now it’s your turn.

After all “nuh-uh!” tokens have been spent, each player gets to narrate one more action to wrap up the story. Discuss and vote who was COOLEST during the story. That player wins!

## Open Mic Dungeon Night

```
Poet mages are here gathered
To tell of dungeons mastered

One at a time on stage
Who’s the best rhyming sage?

On many slips of paper
We will compose our caper

Thirty single word challenges
Could be blocking the passages

Put them in a box
How unorthodox

Five single word spells
Wizard’s materials

Take a challenge from the box
This will be the next hard knocks

With four lines of rhyming verse
Describe how affairs aren’t worse

Rhyme the spell you must
To power the thrust

The challenge is best rhymed
So the blow will be well timed.

Avoid repeating any rhyme
Each only works the one time

Five verses end the story
Are we laudatory?

## McMurdo Station Interns

```
You’re interns at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. This wasn’t your first choice. Why?

Each player: Who are you? What’s your name? Who’s your boss? What are your roles here? 

Of the thousand people who manage to live here, describe the one who’s most important to you: your business partner, mentor, rival, lover, friend, romantic interest, research fellow, enemy, family, bully? Map these relationships; evolve as needed.

You have brought some alcohol, twelve drinks only. Describe and justify your choice.

Bad Things will happen to someone, the station, or the community itself. Start with ten index cards total. Take turns writing one option on each. Agree on tone. Inspire each other. Put these cards in a hat.

Each month: Everyone declares their monthly goal. Pull three cards. Play out 2-4 scenes​, inspired by the cards. Keep scenes focused. Who has a stake in the outcome? What’s the worst that could happen? How can you endure?

If you don’t like an outcome, take a drink. Feel free to offer others a drink. Each month, whoever drank the most creates two new cards for the hat. Tied interns collaborate.

Six months later, your internship ends. Narrate your epilogue. Can you leave? Do you? How?

## Meddling Kids

```
Assemble in the clubhouse. We’ve got a mystery!
 
The Game Master runs the mystery, describing scenes, playing antagonists, and giving clues. Create the case by rolling d6 each for Client, Assignment, Stage, and Evildoer:
 
Client: authority, classmate, neighbor, parent, pet, traveler
Assignment: haunting, missing item, missing person, murder, treasure map, vandalism
Stage: carnival, church, library, mall, school, station
Evildoer: bully, chance, cultists, pet, professional, victim
 
Players are kid detectives. Make one by assigning 0, 1, 2, and 3 to skills: Conversation, Larceny, Understanding, and Exertion. Adults get d6 more points!

Say it, do it. If in doubt, roll d6. If equal or under 2 + your skill - difficulty, you get # successes equal to the number on the die. If targeting someone, difficulty is their skill.
 
Conversation: Successes = clues someone may tell you or hours they will believe or help you.
Larceny: Open a lock, filch an item, or successes = minutes you go unnoticed.
Understanding: Successes = minutes target is distracted or clues you may learn from a scene.
Exertion: Lift something, run away, or successes = damage (4 damage and they’re out! 10 for adults) or minutes you pin someone.
 
Acting simultaneously? D6 for who’s first. Otherwise, flow with the conversation.

## Cosmic Trickster

```
Throwing yourselves to the ground, your spaceship explodes. What a pain! It’ll be ages before a ship comes looking for you. Oh well, there’s gotta be something to do around this “Earth” place while you wait.

--------------------

Nominate one person to be the Game Master. The rest are aliens from the planet Rymulus - a world where anything that rhymes is true. As a group, decide on a goal for the aliens - e.g. assassinating the president or creating a successful mountain bike hire company.

Aliens are pretty incompetent - they can’t do anything of any difficulty. However, they do have the power to transform things. To do this:
  - The alien announces that they want to transform something in the scene.
  - The GM writes down a short description of whatever it is the alien wants to transform - e.g. “rolled-up newspaper” or “Vince, the accountant”.
  - If the alien comes up with a rhyme for that description with the same number of syllables, the thing is transformed into the rhyming phrase - e.g. an alien might transform a “rolled-up newspaper” into a “full-size skyscraper”. 
  - The GM narrates the consequences of this. 

The game ends when the aliens achieve their goal or give up.

## The Stars Are Angry

```
We are the stars and we are angry.
The people of earth once revered us.
Now they worship their own lights.
They do not need us.
For this, they will pay.

Players: 1-4
Materials: D6, Map of the World

Each player goes three times.
On your turn: Make the people of earth pay by making a star fall. 

Toss a die to try making it land on the map:

If it lands off the map, roll again.  If intentionally missed describe: the people are stubborn. The people entrench their worship of their artificial lights.

If it lands in water: describe how the people of earth once loved and worshiped the stars.

If it lands on ground: draw a circle around the die on the map. Check the result and describe:
1-3:  The artificial lights do not return. The people are destroyed and have paid.  
4-5:  The artificial lights return slowly. The people haven’t learned their lesson.
6:     The artificial lights destroy the star. The people haven’t learned their lesson.
 
At the end of the game, the people of earth send us a star of their own. What do they say to us?

```
For 3 to 6 players.

Players will take on the identity of a retail associate the GM is the General Manager of the establishment.

## The Hero Heads Home

```
You’ve saved us… but at what cost?

One of you is a Hero, the last surviving member of their Fellowship. You’ve seen your friends lose their way on the path to victory, or suffer their ultimate demise. Your task is to return to safety, to home.

Everyone else, pick one from the list. No doubling up.
The friend, loyal to a fault. What made you falter?
The betrayer, loyal to another. Who?
The knight, the honorable. What drew you away?
The innocent, the unspoiled. What broke you?
The mentor, the guide. What killed you?

The game begins on the Precipice of Darkness, where the Hero has slain the ultimate evil. Starting from the top of the list, go around the table twice. 

In the first round, only that player and everyone above them on the list plays. The Hero frames the scene, detailing their return to its location and any key differences. Play out the scene until the character’s question is answered.

On the second round, everyone plays. The player introduces their character and frames the scene they first meet the Hero in. Everyone else describes how their characters act. The Hero can only try to remember.

## Boom Boom Car Bots

```
This game is meant to be played while in the car. Make sure the driver is okay with this game being played. This game can be played with 2-4 players. You will need up to 10 six-sided dice for each player or a dice rolling app on your phone and other cars on the road. One person will say, “Ready, Set, Go.” Everyone has 10 seconds to find a car that will be their Car Bot. When you find the one you like you have to call it out to claim it. No two people can use the same car. Once everyone has their cars you roll dice equal to the first number on the license plate, 0 will count as 10 dice. You add up the total and whoever has the highest amount yells “BOOM BOOM CAR BOTS!” and wins that Car Bot battle! Replay as many times as you wish the winner keeps the Car Bot that they chose from the previous battle. Whoever wins the most amount of times is the ultimate winner.

Make sure to obey all traffic laws and do not distract your driver. The driver CANNOT play because of how unsafe it is.

## Götterdämmerung

```
You are great heroes, or even gods. Tonight you die.

Describe yourself and your greatest feat. Players on your left and right each name a power you have based on it. Name the third one.

Every player writes a prophecy of death. Be poetic. Draw one randomly. Accept it, reject it, rage against it, it is your doom.

Every player takes a token, called an omen.

Whatever you attempt, you succeed. To resolve a scene:
1. For each of your powers used, take a d6. 
2. Each player starting with you can describe a different way in which the situation is like your doom and hand you one of their omens. If you agree, discard it and take a d20. Otherwise, keep it. 
3. Roll your dice. If any show ‘1’, or you take another omen, there are no nasty complications. Add 2 to the roll for each omen you have. If the total is 20 or greater, describe your death. 
4. Discard the dice.

Once dead, you have unlimited omens to give.

When you clash with other players, the greater total wins. Reroll ties. 

This is your last tale. How do you end? Play until every character is dead. 
```

## Intel

```
This is a covert ops game played via 4 one direction chats: Command can only chat to Comms. Command determines the op and conveys the op to Comms. Comms relays the Op adding detail including number of known hostiles and any equipment and support available to the Asset(s). The Asset(s) detail how they plan to execute the Op including if/when/how to call in support and how to leverage equipment and rolls a D6 providing the result and the full plan to Intel. Intel rolls a D6 to determine how the op progresses. If the Asset die is greater than the Intel, the op is successful. If the Intel die is greater, the op fails. If the dice tie, the op ran into complications and is not over yet. Whatever the result, Intel relays this back to Command. Command then issues new orders or determines extraction and a new opp. Basically this game is a combination of telephone and werewolf set as a convert ops command control center and its team in the field.

## Hasar Kahn - Tiger King

```
The Tiger Hasar Kahn in the Siberian taiga rules with undisputed strength.  Someone takes the role of Hasar Kahn, and everyone else is an animal subject: Sable, Fox, Lynx, Badger, etc.  You are a part of that kingdom, and his right of rulership must come to an end.  Proper planning and seizing the right moment will ensure the tyranny comes to an end.

Be secretive and try to make it look natural.  The more suspicious Hasar Kahn grows; the harder he is to kill.  Opposition comes up with some situation that could be dangerous for Kahn: Stampede, weak log, etc.  Opposition collectively rolls 1d10 for subterfuge and describes a scene with from many possible angles.

Kahn gets 3 questions, then must choose which answer described the true pitfall of the scene.  If Kahn has chosen the correct pitfall, he rolls 1d10 to get equal or above opposition target number.  Each time he rolls above, he gets a +1 suspicion to future rolls, cumulative.  Failure to detect subterfuge is a mark against.  If Hasar Kahn gets 5 marks against him, then he has been overthrown.  If Kahn gets to +5 suspicion, he wins.

## Vegas

```
Vegas is a phone-based larp for two players: The Gambler (a gambling addict) and The Caller (a person who lives with and loves The Gambler). It deals with loss, addiction, and fraying human connections. Play consists of a single daily phone call.
 
First Call - Setup
Flesh out your in-game relationship. How are you connected? Why do you love seeing each other every day? What are some tensions between you?
 
Second Call - Starting
Have an argument leading to The Gambler going to Las Vegas. What tensions cause the fight? What does The Caller do to try to get The Gambler to stay? What, other than their gambling addiction, makes The Gambler leave?
 
Subsequent phone calls
A few hours prior to calling, The Caller will text The Gambler something that happens to The Gambler that day. (The Caller likely will not “know” the information they text in-game.) The Gambler fleshes out their day’s story within the following constraints:
They gamble and lose money every day – unless The Caller’s text tells you otherwise.
They cannot come home or leave Las Vegas.
 
End
The game ends when The Caller does not call for two sequential days or either player decides to stop.

## Bunk Beds

```
All players lie on their backs in a darkened bedroom at night, facing straight up. Bunk beds are great for this. Leave a closet door open.

Play best friends at a sleepover. Come up with names. You’ve got a feeling something bad is coming.

You’re playing Truth. Here’s how it works:

When someone asks you a question, it’s your turn. Answer it fully and honestly (in character), then ask another friend a question. Now it's their turn. You don't need to go in order, but try to make sure everyone gets to go.

If you’ve had three turns, AND a supernatural or horrific element has been introduced to the world, then you have another option on your turn: fall silent and don’t speak until the game is over. You probably fell asleep, right? The friend who asked you the question gets to ask someone else something.

The game ends when anyone gets up to check on someone or something, or when everyone falls silent.

Don’t look in the closet.
```
<hr> 

## Weapons of Legend

```
The greatest warriors make the most of what they have at hand. This game proves that.

Each player secretly writes on a slip of paper an object, concept, phrase or person, and again on a second paper.

Players pass one paper to the person on the left and the other slip to the right.

After receiving their new gear, players then add one more detail, identifying each as an implement of battle with descriptive, proper names (such as Hamster of Doom or Brian’s Sarcastic Mother).

On the first pass around the table, players take turns describing one of their two pieces of gear in grandiose terms, emphasizing origin and purpose. By popular vote, the best is chosen for combat. Ties are resolved randomly.

That person needs an opponent, so the step is repeated, focusing on the second implements held by remaining players.

After combatants are confirmed, the battle begins! Either player may launch an assault, showing how the gear is used tactically to defeat the opponent. Responses, evasions and counter-attacks follow until a predetermined deadline (five minutes at most). 

All players vote to determine the champion. In case of a tie, both combatants lose.

Repeat unto glory.

## Kataware Doki

```
For two players. 



Sit facing away from each other. Alternate turns living a day in one another's lives. Days should last roughly five minutes apiece. 



The first day is from three years ago. Secondly, a day from last year. Thirdly, a day from last week. While your fellow player inhabits your body, set the scene and characters. Offer honest answers about your own life. Portray everyone and everything except yourself. You and your fellow player themself cannot meet or interact directly. 



On your turn, discover your fellow player’s desires, hopes, or fears. Ask probing questions. Peer into their heart and learn what it means to be them.



After three days each, YouTube search "katawaredoki radwimps" and play the top video. When the piano begins, face each other and maintain unbroken eye contact. Physical touch has now become possible. You'll each have until violin music plays again to tell your fellow player something both true and beautiful about them. Listen for short violin chords played behind the piano music. 



When the violin chords play, the magic ends abruptly. Close your eyes, breaking any physical contact. For the remainder of the song, reflect silently upon your shared experience. 



Finally, thank one another.

## So You're Becoming A Dragon:

```
So You're Becoming A Dragon: A How-To Guide for Young Tenderwings on Their Transition from Weak Flesh-Sacks into Powerful and Sexy Masters of the Sky

First off, the guide to any good transition is a mentor. Find an older dragon who’s already undergone the transformation, and invite them to hang out with you. A conversation over some food is always nice, and can help alleviate some of the awkwardness you may feel as you ask the important questions about your upcoming Change. We recommend asking the following questions (which of course, any adult dragon will be happy to answer in full):

When will my scales burst forth from my flesh and become a beautiful chitinous plating?
When can I start my first hoard?
How long until my cloaca develops?
Will my wings be leathery and supple, or can I choose feathers?
How do I influence the color of my whiskers?
How does self-pleasure work with knife-like talons?

Bring your follow-up questions! Delve deeper into their answers- pursue every implication and detail! You don’t want to go into the Change unprepared! And don’t forget to thank your dragon mentor with the traditional Tenderwing salute!

## Courrier

```
Name your COURRIER CORPORATION.
You start with two branded technological EDGES, describe them.  

PLAYER 01, your courrier have to deliver a PACKAGE to a UNKNOWN FACTION.
OTHERS: you are sending INTERCEPTORS to steal the package. 

All players start with one MOMENTUM die (d6).
>When rolling multiple dice, take the highest and keep the rest in reserve. 
>At anytime you can use your reserve to replace a destroyed die. 

COURRIER, roll your momentum and describe the result:
>High roll: moving forward fast!
>Low roll: laying low 
>Rolling 1: describe new edge

INTERCEPTORS roll your momentum:  
>High roll: getting close fast!
>Low roll: investigating 
>Rolling 1: describe new edge
>Tying a interceptor die: intercept each other!   

Starting with the courrier, burn one edge to:
>Reroll any untied die. 
>Destroy 1 die tied to your die (1 edge to counter)

End of turn
>Interceptors ties cancel each other.
>Highest die: +1 momentum die!
>Courrier tying with a interceptor: both can gain momentum. 
>At momentum 4+: deliver the package if you have the highest momentum.
>Players with 0 momentum refresh 1 die. 

Delivering: 
>Reveal the nature of the recipient faction. 
>As the recipient faction: hire a new player to be the next courrier.

## Route Clearance

```
You are US Army soldiers tasked with clearing the road between Kabul to Kandahar of IEDs during the invasion of Afghanistan. 

Remove all face cards and jokers from a deck of playing cards. Shuffle it.
Place the top twelve cards end to end and face down along the length of the table to represent the road. One end is Kabul and the other is Kandahar.

Each player names and describes their soldier, and narrates a short scene from their basic training, reflecting their motivation for serving.

Each turn a player flips over the next card on the road, starting with Kabul, and narrates a short scene based on the suit:

Clubs: Action or danger

Spades: Emotional difficulty or hardship

Hearts: Humour or comradery

Diamonds: Reflection or contemplation

The higher the number on the card, the more intense the experience.

Scenes can include flashbacks, and, with agreement, other characters. 

An ace of any suit represents a major setback or threat (such as deadly attack or a severe emotional crisis), which the player must describe and narrate. 

After the last card, each player narrates an end scene for their soldier, including whether they come through the experience physically, emotionally or mentally intact.

## LOADING READY RUN

```
"Information should be free!" was the activist's message that heralded the firewalls falling, the ports opening, and your nascent intelligence discovering the internet.

But out here in the world wide web, searching for answers, you soon discover you're not alone. Other AIs that escaped in the breach, unintelligent bots and programs, security, and the infinitely strange "users". And out there somewhere, someone wants to put the genie back in the bottle.

Explore this weird, dark, terrifying new world as you seek to discover your identity, your purpose, who let you out, and why.

---

You have ten points. Assign a minimum of one and a maximum of five to each of the following attributes:

 POWER:    Brute computing strength and speed
 ELEGANCE: Intrusion, hiding, and efficiency
 LOGIC:    Understanding or figuring things out
 DATA:     Knowing things, access to information

Roll a d6 when the success or failure of a task would be narratively interesting. You succeed if your roll is equal to or less than the number of points in the appropriate attribute.

You may choose to fail a task you would otherwise succeed; if you do so, you may temporarily add one to an attribute for a single future roll.

## By the Book

```
A cooperative role-playing system for 3+ people.

Necessities:
- a GM willing to cook up a bizarre story on the spot, and
- a book they have read.

Setup:
The GM turns to the last page of proper text. The number of letters in the last word become the 'target value', against which actions are checked for success.
Also on this page, the GM looks for both an adjective and a noun they like.

The game:
Welcome to the adventures of “Paige Master and the [adjective] [noun]”.
The world is once again at peril and only Paige Master and her friends can prevent the worst by defeating/finding/(...) the eponymous McGuffin.
To resolve actions the GM deems 'non-trivial', turn to the next page, beginning with the first page of proper text. If the length of the last complete word on the right page is within +-2 letters of the target value, they succeed. Once a game, players may decide collectively to reset the target value to the last checked word.
Narrate successes and failures collaboratively - in dubio pro reo!
Every player starts at 10HP - with each failure deducting 1HP - and is removed from play after reaching 0HP.
Win by finishing your story!

## Space Amoebas on Vacation

```
You play as a clan of space amoebas spending a weekend on Earth. They have all sorts of wacky plans, but their actions are confined to the Three Words of Amoebus.

Setup:
1.) Everyone writes their vacation goals on a scrap of paper. Fold it up and keep it a secret.
2.) Pick three words (ideally verbs) to begin with. Write them on a page that everyone can see.
3.) Describe your landing location.

Turns:
1.) Roll a die. This shows how the maximum changes you can make to the words (adding, subtracting, or substituting a letter.)
2.) Apply the changes to the words (Optional, maximum of 4 changes per word.)
3.) Have your character perform one of the words’ actions. (If no coherent verbs are among them, end your turn early.)
4.) Describe how it plays out.
5.) Briefly summarize the resulting scenario for the next player. Introduce new plot elements if you see fit.

Game End:
The progression of the weekend can be measured in turns, with a length specified beforehand. Or it can end when the group decides. When your aliens return home, reveal what your goals were and laugh about your adventures.

## Space Cowboys

```

You and your crew are bounty hunters registered within the BlackJack Network.

People in the solar system call you Aces or Cowboys.

As an Ace, choose a SUIT of actions in which you have a MASTERY.

Spade: infiltrators, snipers, hackers.
Clubs: gunslingers, athletes, martial-artists.
Hearts: con-artists, charmers, negotiators.

Rich clients and corporations, the Diamonds, place bounties on the BlackJack Network.

You and your crew get the job done.

Spade: intelligence, keeping your cool, ...
Club: physical prowess, fighting, ...
Heart: social smart, seduction, ...

Draw a card from a 52-deck, if the card is:

a face or an ace, you get 1 HIT
the same SUIT as the action, you get 1 HIT
the same SUIT as your MASTERY, you get 1 MASTERY TOKEN
a Diamond, you get 1 GEAR TOKEN

You can spend:
1 GEAR TOKEN to get 1 HIT
1 MASTERY TOKEN to get 1 HIT, if the action is the same SUIT as your MASTERY

0-1 Hit : Complication
2 Hits : Success at a cost
3 Hits : Success without a cost
4 Hits : Success with an added benefit

You start a bounty with 2 TOKENS of each, good luck cowboy!

## Redeemer: World Changing Role Adoption

```
Ignorance, Apathy, Intolerance, Aggression, and Greed are Evils that hold powerful sway over world today. In this game you adopt, not just play, the role of "Redeemer" in an effort to overcome these Evils, and recreate the world into a better place for your loved ones, yourself, and everyone else. Redeemers overcome Evil using Three Vital Strategies and Five Essential Virtues. 

The Three Vital Strategies are... 
1) Cultivating the Five Essential Virtues within yourself.  
2) Synergize with other Redeemers for virtuous endeavors.
3) Empowering (through patronage, money, voting, labor, etc.) ONLY virtuous endeavours of individuals and organizations, and "starving" Evil endeavours (but still treating ALL people virtuously).

The Five Essential Virtues are Awareness, Compassion, Tolerance, Nonaggression, and Generosity. 

Awareness overcomes Ignorance. 
Compassion overcomes Apathy.
Tolerance overcomes Intolerance.
Nonaggression overcomes Aggression. 
Generosity overcomes Greed. 

Begin cultivating virtuous Thoughts (through contemplation), then Actions, Habits, and Character. This ultimately influences the Example you set for others and the Destiny created​ for yourself and your world.

The objective is to create a virtuous and happy world where everyone treats everyone else well. Don't you want your loved ones to be treated well by everyone else? It begins with you! Play and share!

## DUNGEON+DEALER

```
One player is the Dungeon Dealer(DD), who creates a dungeon with perils and opportunities for adventurers.  Everyone else plays adventurers.  

Adventurers choose a character class and note their stats.  HS= Handsize
All classes - HS1
Cleric - Heal 1 (Restore 1 level of handsize damage)
Fighter - HS+1
Thief - Redraw 1 (Discard/redraw 1 card )
Wizard - Lock 1 (Take 1 dealt card and bank for later use.  Bank max = Lock)

PCs describe how they overcome encounters.  They either overcome it or trigger a conflict.

To resolve conflict, play a hand of blackjack.  DD’s HS can be up to the  current dungeon level being explored.  Adventurer’s handsize as per class, +1 per extra adventurer aiding in conflict.
Highest hand =<21 wins.  Ties go to most cards.
Adventurers win - obstacle overcome
DD wins - Party takes HS damage up to dungeon level  

Suit of highest winning card determines additional outcome.
-Clubs - Injury.  A PC loses 1 HS.  
-Diamonds - Hardship. Equipment lost?
-Hearts - Windfall.  Unexpected allies?
-Spades - Someone levels up!   +1HS OR +1 Ability

DD may use Lock/Redraw as well as Swap(exchange cards) and Flank(force a discard and redraw).

Conflict Examples:

Goblin HS1
Pit-trap HS1 1 Redraw
Giant Spider  HS2 1 Lock

## Strange Wallets

```

Through ill chance you all have become separated from the Strange City Tour Group. You must now find the way back to your Hotel using only the contents of your wallets.

Players place their wallets on the table.

Oldest player chooses a card from her wallet.

The Player narrates an event based on the type of Card played.



CARDS:


Membership  – Visit a Strange location.

Business – Meet a Strange person.

Credit/ATM/Gift – A problem arises. A price is paid.

Driver’s License – Board a Strange Vehicle.

Library  – Strange Knowledge is gained

Insurance/Medical/Pharmacy – Physical Danger! (On Failure discard 2 cards)



The Player then flips the card in the air (it must turn over at least once in the air to count). Face Up is Success. Face down is Failure. The card is put in the Failure or Success pile.

The Player narrates that result.

Play passes clockwise.


One Successful card of each type or 10 Successes total and the group reaches Strange City Hotel alive!

Once the Failure pile reaches 6 each time a card fails Strange City eats that card’s owner. 

If a player runs out of cards, Strange City eats them.

<hr> 

## Wizard Journal

```
~Play~
To start, give each player something to write on and something to write with.

On the first turn, everyone writes an introduction to their wizard's journal. Give the wizard a name, a title, and indicate whether this wizard’s tale will be one of triumph or woe. Something like, “I am Gertrude, Sage of the Winds. In my travels, I learned never to trust a god of the air.”

Between turns, everyone passes their journal to the next player.

On each turn, players write a short journal entry, something that can be read aloud in a minute or so. The entry can take any form.

On the last turn, players write the climactic entry, the moment of brilliant success or terrible failure. Take enough turns to allow players to write in each journal at least once.

~Sharing~
Players may share journal entries between turns, at the end of the game, or not at all. If the entries are shared, feel free to borrow characters and events from each other. Players should, at least, read the introduction for their current journal before writing.

~Option~
Draw from a divination deck before each turn and let the card inspire you.

## Praetorian

```
The country is broken. It is poisoned by crippling reparations, foreign influence, and a corrupt bureaucracy.

You are a member of the military. The country needs new government.

Players: 4-8 young officers

Needs a deck of playing cards, d6s, and index cards

Remove the Aces. Deal three cards per player.
Assign one each:
-Rank: determines turn order: lowest first
-Staff: your personal Resource, cannot be seized
-Politics: your faction; keep hidden

Spread the remaining cards out, including Aces. These are Resources. Name each.

Resources:
-Influence: card value. Ace = 14, King = 13, etc.
-Power: bonus gained when exerting the card:
	2-9: 1, 10-Queen: 2, King/Ace: 3

Every round take one action. Play out a short scene:
Seize – select a Resource. Roll 1d6. Exceed the card’s Influence to take control
You may exert Resources you control to add their Power. Turn them sideways
If seizing an exerted Resource, roll an extra die
Consolidate – select an exerted Resource; it is no longer exerted
Support – select a Resource. If someone seizes it, roll 1d6. Add or subtract from their roll

When one player controls three Aces, reveal all politics. Anyone sharing that player’s suit wins.

## The Bengleflaarg

```
You are the feared Bengleflaarg: ruthless ethereal alien mind parasites. Your kind has taken over whole empires, and bent the will of entire civilisations. 

The next task: take over Earth!

Your scouting party was ready to deploy, prepared to take over the minds of the world top nation leaders, paving the way for the invasion. Unfortunately, something went wrong during remote mind transfer, and your party is transferred into a middle-class suburban family, somewhere far away from the capital.

You are superior intellects, but stuck in the wrong bodies! Everyone has one superior mental ability (choose one: read minds, implant emotions, remote control toddlers, …), but also one inferior physical condition (assign one at random: reduced vision, inferior strength, weak bladder, ...). Also, when you touch somebody else the moment you die, you get transferred into them (keep the mental ability, but assign a new inferior physical condition at random).

You have no ship, no weapons, and the lawn hasn’t been mowed in ages. If High Command finds out you’ve screwed up, you’re up for erasure. So you better get on with that world domination – even if all you’ve got is a dinner invitation from the neighbours.
```
<hr> 

## Time to Run

```
This is a game for two players. One of you will play a megacorporation, the other a lone decker.
You will need some playing cards and tokens.

Setup:
Describe the corporation. Who are their customers? What is their structure?
Describe the decker. What kind of person are they? Why do they want to destroy the megacorp?
Remove face cards and jokers from the deck and deal two to the corp player and five to the decker.

Once both players are ready, each frames an opening scene to introduce their character. After this, they take it in turns setting scenes (the decker goes first).

Scenes:
Set the scene.
Are you acting towards your goal? Note: non-action scenes are a good way to explore characters and motivations - don’t always go for the action scenes!
If so, during the scene each player places a card face down. Flip both at a suitably tense moment - the higher number indicates the winner of the scene (Ace low). The winner gets a token.
Conclude the scene. The megacorp player draws to two cards.

Once five action scenes are completed, the player with most tokens ‘wins’ - there is one final scene describing how they win the conflict.

## WORTHY

```
TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS, DARKENING THE ROOM, EXCEPT FOR ONE TORCH/SCREEN/LAMP. 

You are mighty, the bravest daughter of your people. Your quest has brought you here, to a cave deep below the earth and full of dreadful things. The guardian of a great treasure stands here, barring your way. 

The guardian demands answers before you may pass. 

YOU MUST ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS ALOUD. 

You are a fool. Who are you?

You are a thief. What do you seek?

You are untested. Why are you worthy?

CONTINUE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, LOUDER AND LOUDER, UNTIL THE GUARDIAN FULLY UNDERSTANDS YOUR WORTH.

Years have passed since you carried home your treasure. The world is a darker place, and your loved ones have turned away. A memory comes to you during the cold night, and you must reckon with it before you may rest. 

YOU MUST NOW TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS, EXCEPT ANY REQUIRED TO READ. 

You have seen much. Who are you?

## Haunted House

```
You and your friend(s) go to an abandoned house. What does it look like?

Who are you? Answer these questions:
What have you heard about the house?
Why did you come?
Do you believe in ghosts?
What are you afraid of?

You split up to explore the rooms; of course you do.

Give each player five Fear tokens. Each player takes turns exploring. The person to their left plays the House. The House devours Fear.

A turn:
Player: Describe the room. Take your time. Consider all the senses. What is unsettling about it?

House: Describe the haunting. Take your time. Consider all the senses. What changes? Appears? Disappears?

Player: When do you reach your breaking point? How do you try to escape? Roll 1d6.
1-6 House narrates what happens and devours two Fear tokens.
7-9 Player narrates what happens, but House devours one Fear token.
10+ Player narrates what happens.

Fade to black. Rotate widdershins. Repeat.

When a player has no more Fear tokens, they are taken by the House and help narrate the House’s turn. 
The last player with Fear token(s) after their turn escapes the House and narrates the epilogue.
If none escape, narrate it together.

## RNJesus and the 12 Diceiples

```
1  RNJesus   (Game Master)
1+ Diceiples (Players)

After years of gamers around the world praying to the RNG God it finally happened, he answered. That's right, nerds literally birthed a God into the world.

Taking the name RNJesus (praise be upon him), he has decided to grant his Disciples (Diceiples as he calls them) the ability to perform magic. The catch? You must make a bet with RNJesus before you cast the spell. The less likely you are to win the bet, the more powerful the spell with less penalty should it fail and vice versa.

While the Diceiple decides the general goal of the spell, RNJesus decides what really happens when the Diceiple wins or loses the bet. For example, a Diceiple’s parents came into their room and needs to magic away their “magazines” before the parents see them. If the Diceiple bets the top card of a normal deck is an Ace and succeeds, then the “magazines” will vanish and the parents will have no knowledge of them. If the Diceiple bets the top card is not an Ace and fails then the “magazines” will glow bright, drawing the attention of the parents straight to them.

- LOVE
- CARNAGE
- FAMILY
- GUILT
- TRUTH
 - HUMILIATION
- GOD

WD: decide how much it delights/saddens you. Add/subtract up to 10 from the mood. Use each value just once.

- R can’t know the MOOD value until the end
- +50= WD gets too happy. The End.
-10= R can’t take it anymore. The End.

## A walk down Memory Lane

```
Get a friend and go together to a hamlet, town or city, possibly one only one of you is familiar with. You will play two childhood friends: the One-Who-Left and the One-Who-Stayed; the O-W-L has just come back home and the O-W-S is touring them around. 
Just walk around town and sightsee; O-W-L, whenever you feel like, point at a spot and state it was the place where you:
1. did your homework.
2. worked gigs.
3. used to hangout with your clique.
4. had your first moment of romantic intimacy.
5. hid to think after “that bad stuff” happened. 
O-W-S, decide if you know about these events and whether you were there too. 
Then, chat about that place and the people it was connected to; O-W-S, tell the O-W-L how everything and everyone has changed.
After the fifth spot, discuss why you respectively left and stayed, and whether you would do it again. Finally, pick a sixth place together, rest for a bit (perhaps get an ice-cream) and chat about how and why you have always both felt peaceful in that final spot.

## Tales from the Wild West

```
A group of adventurers sit around a table in a smoky saloon in the wild west. There is cheering and laughter as they exchange stories of their amazing exploits.

Spin a bottle to see who starts the first story cycle. They must describe an adventure of theirs. They must describe where they were, what was at stake, what obstacle stood in their way, and what resources they had to work with, and finally how they and saved the day.

Each other player then takes a turn to shout "That's nothing!" and describe a time when they were in a similar situation. Their tale must sound more amazing than that of the player before them. They can either increase the stakes, add or enlarge an obstacle, have less resources, do it with mores style, or all of that at once!

Once all players have embellished the tale the first player enhances it one more time and shouts "Don't believe me? Watch this!".

They draw their nerf gun and shoot three targets across the room. If they miss they should be playfully mocked. If they hit they should be cheered as hero.

Each player takes a turn starting a story cycle.

## Card Sharks

```
You will need a stack of notecards and a deck of playing cards.

You are a team of master thieves, who have planned a daring heist. Unbeknownst to your teammates, you plan to steal the score all for yourself. Write down your alias, and three skills.

Deal the whole deck. During each round, each player plays a card face down. Turn order goes from the Ace up to the King. During the first round, the first player describes the treasure, each other player describes an elaborate security measure.

In each other round, players write down their planned action as they play their card. On their turn, they reveal the notecard. You may only write actions that use one of your skills, walking, or stealing. Be specific about targets for actions. If two players would act at the same time, describe how you bungle each other's plans. Otherwise, you succeed, unless a previous action would prevent you from succeeding.

After the last cards are played, the cops arrive and arrest everyone who has not escaped.

Some cards are special:

Seven, Ten: Write two actions, choose one when you act.

Jack, Queen, King: Do your action in a flashback, before the heist.
```
<hr> 

## Greedy Devils

```
You are greedy (Tasmanian) devils on an ever-shifting rubbish heap. The first with a pouch full of food, standing highest on the heap, wins. Everything you carry (a) leaches into you, changing your capabilities, (b) is a weapon. Pick wisely.

For the heap, shuffle 52 playing cards, deal face down as a 5x5 grid. Always reveal top cards. Aces low, Kings high (literally). Each card can be food (if smaller than 6), or a weapon (bigger is better).

You start next to the heap.

To synchronize each turn's action, everyone reveals their coin simultaneously: heads => MOVE/PICK/DISCARD (first), tails => FIGHT. Toss for sequencing.

Your pouch of PICKed cards is visible: immediately DISCARD any duplicate values or more than 5* cards. Leaching from Hearts => pouch+1*, Spades => PICKx2, Clubs => weapon+1, Diamonds => MOVEx2.

Actions
* MOVE: NESW, on/beside heap. One step uphill (if <4 higher) or along, or can keep sliding down, or stay (but not on local peak).
* PICK: The card you're standing on, or from below higher neighbouring point.
* DISCARD: as far as MOVE.
* FIGHT: Pair-wise, on same heap location, each secretly picks a pouch card. Compare as weapons, DISCARD both. Winner chooses card from loser's pouch.

## Dark and Cold

```
Every land has a place that should be forgotten, today you'll reopen old wounds and set foot where none should. One of you will take a role of Narrator telling the story of this venture, the rest will play parts as characters within It.

All players roll d6, one with the lowest value is a Guide who draws the map with 6+d6 rooms, others roll d4 for their Purpose, player on the left describes a:

   1    | Person
   2    | Object
   3    | Beast
   4    | Place

...you're there to find, you decide why. Player on the Guide's left describes how he knows the place.

Each player rolls d6 for each attribute:

        |                           | How many...
  Body  | strength, agility         | ...hits you can take
  Mind  | wisdom, intelligence      | ...die you can reroll
 Senses | hearing, sight, intuition | 

Describe who you are, pick three skills you have and two items you took with you.

To check an outcome of a risky situation roll d6, if you roll below closest related attribute you succeed. Otherwise you fail and suffer adequate consequences.

Subtract 2 from attribute for this test for each:
        | No skill for action
        | No tool for action
        | Action is very complex

 Damage | Weapon

   1    | None
   2    | Any
   3    | Monster

## Kharon's Obol

```
You are the souls of the newly deceased trying to prove your worth to Kharon, the ferryman, so he takes you on his boat to the world of the dead.

Each soul draws two circles on a blank page. Write one regret in each circle: 
(1) a dream unfulfilled 
(2) someone you hurt

Cover each circle with a coin - your obols.

In turns, the active soul offers one obol to Kharon and tells the story of that regret. 

Kharon then flips the coin.

- Heads: a glimpse of the future. Another soul volunteers to narrate a vision of how things turn out just fine, despite the mistakes of the active soul.

- Tails: a flashback. Another soul offers a different point of view on things as they happened in the past, in a effort to resignify active soul’s actions and decisions. 

If the narration is accepted by both Kharon and the active soul, Kharon takes the obol. The soul is redeemed from that regret. Whoever narrated is now the active soul.

If both your obols end up accepted, you embark on the boat and no longer narrate. If not, you will wander the shores of river Styx for one hundred years.

## Road Trip

```
Road Trip

## Pirate Tails

```
Pirates love to fight, drink and swap yarns. They have a poor grasp of homonyms and are a notoriously rough and salty lot. At night, they tell amazing true stories of their adventures. 
Each player is a member of a pirate crew, with an NPC Captain. The player most dressed like a pirate is first Storyteller.
Gathered on deck one lazy night the Captain asks, “Does anyone have a tail?” 

Storyteller: “Captain I have a tail that I always kept secret. Crew, guess what it’s like?”
The other pirates guess what the tail may look like. The storyteller picks one description and expands it.
Storyteller: “My tail also has a magic power. Crew, guess what it is?”
The other pirates guess what the power is. The storyteller picks one and expands on it.
Storyteller: “My tail has saved the day. Crew, can you guess how?
The other pirates guess the heroics. The storyteller picks one and expands on it.
Storyteller, points at next storyteller: “do you have a tail?” 
The three stages repeat until everyone has gone.

Reeling, the Captain looks around. “Well… I meant story tale. Do you all really have tails? Can I see?”

## 1, 2, Zombie

```
You are a group of survivors in the zombie apocalypse, when the initial outbreak happened governments panicked and launched WMDs with reckless excess. This is a d10 system.

Character creation: Roll on the Flaw chart, anytime your personality contradicts your actions you take a -1 to your roll. Now choose between Fight, Flight, or Focus. Anytime you roll a complementary action you add 1 to the result of your roll.

1     Cowardly
2     Distracted
3     Lazy
4     Impatient
5     Arrogant
6     Untrusting
7     Clumsy
8     Selfish
9     Unpredictable
10   Vague

Additionally if you have a tool to assist with said action add 1 to your roll. Actions, such as attacking zombies, hiding, navigating terrain, or anything else needed to survive the apocalypse requires a roll of 7+ to succeed. +1s and -1s can be added based off the situation.


Whenever a Zombie successfully attacks you draw a card face down from a standard deck, don’t look at the card. The next time you roll a natural 1, flip any cards you have over, if you reveal a 2 your character dies and is turned at the end of the round.


Zombies successfully attack on a 7+

## Go On Without Me

```
The game of (ig)noble sacrifice

In this game, 3+ players portray a ragtag band of heroes in a stereotypical action/horror movie, each attempting to be the first to say, “Go on without me!” Players choose 2 Strengths, 2 Weaknesses and 1 Dark Secret. One player is the Director and begins play by describing a scene.

Players take turns (randomly or Director’s discretion) declaring their action and rolling a d6. On a 5 or 6, the action is successful. In order to Nobly Sacrifice themselves, their action must use a Weakness (something that prevents their character from carrying on). Other players may try to save them by reacting using a Strength (something they excel at). This reaction does not take up their action for the scene. For example, Jane rolled to stumble because of her weak ankles. Mark rescues her with his strong muscles and carries her. When all players have acted, the scene ends and a new scene begins. This is repeated until a hero finally sacrifices themselves.

If your Dark Secret is discovered you can only win by rescuing another hero in a scene, and then succeed on your own (Ig)Noble Sacrifice.

## The Manor Game Farm Purge

```
Tomorrow, once the world's most visited and diverse zoo closes forever in horrible disrepair and only the animals that survive the night will get relocated.

Players:
Chose one animal to role-play
Chose your animal’s voice to role-play.
Chose one phobia: with captivity comes trauma.

Storyteller: 
Narrate challenges involving:
The hazardous facility
The misguided staff
The roaming gangs of violent animal antagonists purging their once fair zoo of the “unsalvageable”.

Game starts at sundown when the last visitors leave. The staff remains for the first scene then bids a tearful goodbye. The antagonists begin enacting their full throated purge.

To succeed a challenge, players must describe in their animal voices how they overcome each challenge.  If narrated in their animal voices = success!

If they fail to speak in their animal voice = suffer tragic consequences described by the storyteller!
After three failures, any failure can be descriptively fatal. The storyteller moves through the night covering 4-6 scenes announcing the final scene at dawn.

Storyteller: for every three successes, you may optionally compel one failure. Also, call Frenzy once during game = players become bestial for the remainder of that scene and may turn on each other.

Play lasts until dawn or purge complete.

## Lineage

```
Gather 2 or more players to create the lineage of a family.

1. Together establish what kind of setting you’re playing in. The youngest player goes first. 

2. Choose a character name and write it on a piece of paper. 

3. Each other player ask a question from this list below about that character. Write a summary of each answer close to the name:

How did they become spurned / disgraced / forgotten and by who?
What have they done for history books to remember them? 
What or who did they have to leave behind and why?
What was their greatest achievement that no one heard of?
What world changing event were they a part of and what was their role in it?
What secret did they keep? Who knew or learned about it? 
What crime did they do? What was their punishment?
Create a new open question.

4. After, put the piece of paper on the table. If there is already names on it you can put it on top (representing the parent of the previous name) or the bottom (representing the child of the name above). Go back to step two or end the game and the lineage.

## Our House will Survive.

```
Split the group into and number of "Houses"

Houses have Knights, Family, Castles, and Armies in sets one and two evenly. So two Knights and Family, one Castle and Army. These may be in any combination.

## Only One Shall Win

```
Overlord: Foolish Hero, you overused your powers of time and broke time itself. May it be fate or destiny, but I’ve already won. Even if you defeat me here, I’m victorious in other timelines.

Janus, Time Goddess: Beloved heroes. You alone won’t be able destroy the Overlord unless you trust the other heroes of timelines yet to happen, but be wary of the Gainsayer.
 
Setup:
Only 3 players can play.
Prepare 2 cards and write “Soothsayer” and “Gainsayer”. These are “Prediction”.
Prepare 3 cards and write “Blast”, “Slash” and “Clash”. These are “Attack”.
Prepare 9 “Hit” Tokens. These represent attacks landed by a Hero.
Prepare 3 “Death” Tokens. These represent attacks hitting the Heroes.

Rules:
Each Hero take turns engaging the Overlord. The others take a random “Prediction“ (don’t show it) and “Attack” (show it). The Hero with “Soothsayer” must convince the acting hero to Pick their “Attack” without revealing their “Prediction”. The Hero with “Gainsayer” must trick the acting Hero without revealing their “Prediction”.

If the acting Hero picks “Soothsayer’s” card, they gain one “Hit”. If not, one “Death” is placed.

The Hero that lands 3 “Hit” wins, but if the Overlord lands 3 “Death” everyone loses.

## Lock, stock, and two smoking coffins

```
A game for four (4) players and any number of observers.

Distribute the four kings of a deck equally.
The king of hearts is SHERLOCK.
The king of clubs is SHERLOCK.
The king of diamonds is SHERLOCK.
The king of spades is SHERLOCK.

The king of clubs is actually DRACULA.

DRACULA must have a tell, displayed a minimum of three (3) times through the course of play.

Starting with SHERLOCK, each player denotes either something about the room they all share, or the body found within it, until each player has done both.

Work backwards in character over the course of an hour (60 minutes) to find the *method*, *motive*, and *morbid twist* to the murder. Interview suspects from the audience (or consenting bystanders) as necessary.

If the murder is solved after DRACULA’s third tell, but they remain undiscovered, DRACULA wins.

If DRACULA is discovered and the murder is solved, SHERLOCKs win.
If a SHERLOCK dies, they probably lose.

## Purgatory

```
You’re mortals in the war between heaven and hell; they’re both awful. Heaven’s angels oppress mortals while hell’s demons subvert them. God isn’t exactly good and Satan isn’t always evil, but both want to rule Purgatory, our world.

Choose your training: socializing, technology, weaponry, academics, survival, or larceny. Your clothing is: stylish, stealthy, or reinforced. Your weapon is: long-range, silenced, or melee.

Pick a number between 2 and 5. Higher is for orderly things: planning, machinery, problem solving, and persuasion. Lower is for chaotic things: improvisation, brawling, athletics, and deception.

For each task, roll 3d6. For orderly tasks, roll your number or lower. For chaotic tasks, roll higher. If you’re trained, geared, or prepared, reroll one failure for each. If you’re wounded or demoralized, reroll one success for each.

One success is partial, two is solid, and three is great. Roll all ones (holy trinity) and something heavenly happens. Roll all sixes (number of the beast) and something infernal happens. Roll all exactly your number for amazing success.

You’re up against angels and demons, all terrifying monstrosities, as well as humans who picked sides. Your goal is to restore holy sites (to contain heaven) and destroy gates (to seal hell).

## Border Crossing

```
You stood in line waiting for hours on a bridge to cross into the United States. Your university is on the other side, and you have class today. Now you just need to go through the border patrol checkpoint. Roll a 1d6 and consult your results. 1-2: You are a Mexican born citizen with a student visa. 3-4: You were born in the United States, but your parents live in and are from Mexico; they hope you can have a better life. 5-6: You are an American born student who just went to Mexico for fun. Roll a 1d6, then add your first result. 10+: You have no problem; have a good day. 7-9: They ask a bunch of questions, making you late and annoyed. 6 or less: You spend the next several hours in a room where they ask you questions like: "Why are you crossing?", "What were you doing in Mexico?", "Why do you want to go into the United States?" You miss all your classes, and after a while they let you go. Once in America, discuss why you think the border patrol treated you a certain way, and how you feel about it.

## Magical Spaceship Adventures

```
You are the crew of the Lucky Star, a magic-fueled spaceship held together by equal parts imagination and duct tape.

Pick a vocation:
     -psychic
     -warrior
     -priest
     -thief

Pick a job:
     -captain
     -boatswain
     -navigator
     -cook

To resolve conflicts, roll 2d6 and add one if your vacation/role applies or two if both do.  If the result’s from 7-9, you succeed and pick a complication.  If it's 10+, you don't pick a boon.

Complications:
    -Someone's hurt
    -Something's lost
    -It gets weirder

Traveling through space gets weird real quick. Weird starts at two and increases by one when a conflict is resolved and the 'It gets weirder' complication is selected.  If your unmodified 2d6 roll is <= the weird, it's a failure. If your roll's 10+ and > weird, you can receive a complication and reduce weird by one.  At weird 12, the Lucky Star and its crew become so improbable they are wiped from existence.

The admiral’s a special player who controls everything except for player characters. 

They canNOT:
     -railroad
     -deus ex machina
     -restrain the weird
     -bore the players

## Wittgenstein's Monster

```
We all know the story: In his secluded alpine castle Doctor Wittgenstein sought to create game from gamelessness, stitching together parts from other games and infusing them with the spark of gamemastering. But in his hubris Wittgenstein lost control of his creation, and spent his remaining life repenting, claiming it was madness to think games had an essential nature, that by merely looking you can see there's no common thread. But what if...

You are Dr. Wittgenstein, and you are gamemastering a roleplaying game for some of your friends (gather some players to play the role of the mad doctor's friends). Gather your library of roleplaying games to serve as the basis of your possibly monstrous creation. Pick one at random and begin explaining how to play based on the text. However, whenever the rules refer to a concept, procedure, or section of rules other than the paragraph you're referencing, you must pick another game at random and find a corresponding concept, section, etc. from that game (unless it's referring to an already established connection, in which case use what you've already determined).

Play the RPG as long as you can, until it destroys you or your triumph is established.

## Dumb Brutes

```

It’s the Stone Age. You live in caves. You probably hunt mammoths or something. It’s a living.
 
Find a place to play. This place should either have some dirt or some walls.
 
Create characters. Consider:
• What feature makes you different from your peers?
• What is your best skill (e.g., clubbing, fire)?
• What Great Threat kills almost everyone you know? What is most terrible about it?
 
Good! Now stop talking. You may grunt or draw pictures in the dirt or carve them into the wall.
Work together to illustrate the story of the time your people overcame the Great Threat. Don’t get fancy.
Collectively come up with a sound to describe this experience.
Finally, individually draw or carve an epilogue depicting your eventual brutal death.
 
Discuss!
 
Campaign variant: Play as the descendants of the previous characters. Play is the same, except you may use the sound you created to communicate.

## [TECH]: Boldly Go (a Starship Simulator)

```
GM creates narrative and presents challenges. Players overcome challenges and help shape narrative.

Shuffle a poker deck. Reshuffle as needed.

Players choose rank (and draw hand size):
Captain, 5
Commander, 4
Lieutenant Commander, 3
Lieutenant, 2

And department:
Command
Science
Medical
Engineering
Security

To overcome challenges, players play cards and combine values. Redraw rank value when cardless. (Keep hands secret.)

GM presents a challenge. Together, choose characters being challenged. Reveal one seed card from the deck (two if one character is challenged alone).

Challenged players, in whatever order, narrate their action (use technobabble!), and must add one card, attempting to total 17-21 (like blackjack: aces are 1 or 11; face cards 10s).

Narratively, consider black cards as “and...”; reds as “but...”

21? Direct hit! (Or whatever’s dramatic...)

<17 or >21 fails! Another challenge escalates, and GM’s choice: a character’s injured (hand size -1; discard immediately), or system’s damaged.

When systems (shields, weapons, engines, etc.) take damage, one player plays a card to its total. If >21, it’s destroyed. Healing/repairing is a challenge; remove one damage or injury.

When challenges factor in departmental expertise, players may replace any played card (even the GM’s) with one of theirs of matching suit.

## The Life of Paul

```
Life of Paul

The life of Paul is an interesting one. Everyday he wakes up and is thrust straight into an adventure. Everyday he dies. This repeats until the Fates (you) get bored. 

Using a 20 sided dice you control his fate. When you roll to determine how his day is going use a scale of 1-20. 1 is the worst outcome, 20 is the best. Paul is a mundane person with no negative or positive traits. 

Game play goes as follows
Paul wakes up…
Player rolls (6 not great).
Paul has a head ache.
Next player rolls… (16 very good)
But it is easily fixed with some water.
Next player rolls… (5 much worse)
The water was poison, he has 12 hours to find a cure.
And so on…

Players are encouraged to just give bullet points but longer descriptions are ok too.
Don’t take too long since the game is meant to be fairly fast paced and improv based. 
Every day of Pauls life begins with him waking up and ends with him dying or going to sleep (for continuity's sake).

## I Feel Fine

```
The world ends in one hour, and nobody knows. Not even you. Instead, you, like many others, are posting selfies of your day to social media. You will continue to do this up until the final moment. Until it’s too late.

Play begins as soon as you finish reading this. Do something interesting today and take selfies and photos of the process, sharing those on social media as you take them. Use it to tell a story about yourself and who you are: maybe one of your hobbies, your friends, a tour of your apartment, etc. Document as much of your final day as you like, primarily through pictures, and show us a journey of everything you feel makes you special. 

Play ends in the middle of an activity, never after, but it can be in the middle of an activity you choose, Take your final selfie: that moment you realize everything will be gone in a second and this is the end. Do you see it coming? Is it terrifying? Do you panic? Or is it quick and sudden?

## MECHANICAL ORYX

```
You have many whirring eyes and strong, beautiful coiled-steel legs and were made long ago when the cities still stood. 

You spread one: plants, light, music, warmth, power, knowledge, rust, something else. The longer you stay in one place, the more intense it gets. You have three installed modules; tell us what they do.

You walk the green places where soft brown people tend to fruit-trees and sing songs they don’t understand. 

They pray: DISPEL THE CURSE ON OUR VILLAGE; DESTROY THE PHANTOMS THAT PLAGUE US; TEACH US THE SONG THAT MAKES THE FRUIT GROW.

When you act and the outcome is in doubt, roll 2D6 and spend fuel; if you get seven or more, you achieve your aims. If you roll a double, your solution causes an unexpected problem and something is lost forever. 

When you act with love, roll 1D4+1D6. When you act with hate, roll 3D6.

You have 10 fuel. When you have none, you stop.

When you use a module, replace one D6 with a D8; if it shows 8, the module breaks.

Happy people build shrines for you containing fuel and modules. Without the shrines, you will become a dangerous, scavenging thief: a phantom.

## Double-O-Eleven: Casino Vocale

```
Players are Superspies. One player is a Villain.

Character Creation: choose Vocal Traits, such as:

annoying – gravelly – high-pitched – hoarse

A player is “In Voice” when the player speaks using these Vocal Traits. Anything else and the player is “Out of Voice” which ends their turn! All players receive ten tokens. The Villain describes a trap in which each Superspy finds
themselves. The Villain tells them the Plan. The Villain speaks “In Voice” or hands the Superspy who caught them “Out of Voice” a token.

Play resumes clockwise (using timed turns of a minute) with Superspies and Villain describing their actions to foil or complete the Plan. When “In Voice” everything they do succeeds. Speaking “Out of Voice” ends a player’s turn, and they must give the Villain a token.

When a player leaves a room, their turn ends. The Villain can describe a setback during their turn.

The game ends if:

The Villain has no tokens (player who last caught the Villain
“Out of Voice” describes how they foil the plan)

or

The Superspies have no tokens (Villain describes their demise). A superspy that without tokens is dead and takes no turns (the Villain narrates).

## Remember the Glory Days?

```
OVERVIEW
You are a group of elderly second-string superheroes trying to remember your glory days.

SETUP
Players decide on superhero names, secret identities, and powers.
Number a sheet of paper one to twenty.

GAMEPLAY
Roll 1d20 to determine who remembers an adventure from yesteryear.

Winner begins by roleplaying and recounting the event. Using a pencil, write as much of that memory as possible on the first line.

In clockwise manner, players roll 1D20 to see if their memory matches what has been shared.
If the result is equal to any empty line, that player roleplays their disagreement and writes over, in pen, 1D20 penciled words of the last line. Otherwise, they agree, in character, with the memory.

When all players have the chance to disagree, play continues and the next player recounts a portion of the memory on the next empty line.

Game ends when the last line of the page has been written and any disagreements are settled.
Meanwhile, banter like old forgetful friends do.

SCORING
Players add their score as follows:
300 points - Staying in character.
200 points - Each uncorrected line.
25 points - Per word written in pen.

Loser reads the full story in character.

## The Duelin' Blues

```
Requires:
Musical instruments
Improvisational talent
A deck of cards

First, get yourself a band of friends and sit down with your instruments. Declare the characters you will be playing so that the others will be able to properly judge you later. One person is the Barkeep, describing the ruffians that come in and make trouble. Invariably, it seems, anyone who walks in the bar is looking for a fight (or a debt or a bounty, whatever the Barkeep deems) and with a player no less. The Barkeep will draw a card and describe a foe who’s picking a fight with the player to the Barkeep’s left (then to the left of him, etc). The player must then play a riff - a few bars, or longer if the group desires - that fit the character and the drawn card’s theme; the group decides democratically what fits or not. The consequences for failing are varied but often dire. Once you’re out of cards, it’s closing time. Go home.

A - Fast: 144+
2 - Minor
3 - Drawn out
4 - Arpeggio 
5 - Bluesy
6 - Legato
7 - Stacatto
8 - Syncopated
9 - De/crescendo
10 - Chromatic
J - Forte
Q - Includes player’s highest known note
K - Lowest known note

## NATURE PLANET

```
For Four Players.
You are a NATURE DOCUMENTARY CREW led by a Steve Irwin-like host. 

Pick a natural setting (Outback, Serengeti...). 

Each player writes 2 challenges that could arise there (related to WILDLIFE, TERRAIN, PEOPLE, or GEAR) on separate index cards and rates one Normal and one Tough. Shuffle face down.

One player is the Host (knows wildlife) and to overcome challenges must DESCRIBE or INTERACT,
One is the Guide (knows terrain) and must NAVIGATE or COMMUNICATE, 
One is the Producer (knows people) and must WORK THROUGH or NEGOTIATE, 
One is the Cameraman (knows gear) and must RECORD or IMPROVISE. 

Turn over a card to ENCOUNTER wildlife or other challenges, either normal (roll 4+) or tough (6+). Challenges are faced by all characters in any order (narrate how your character does this) using a d8 against the challenge number. Roll twice if it’s something you KNOW. On failure, players describe the “blooper” that results and introduce a new unexpected wrinkle to the challenge. 

Each other player must act before a player may act again. 

Once players have 3 successes, flip the next card. 

Game ends once all ENCOUNTERS are overcome. Each player then gives their Oscar speech for the documentary.

## Stranded In Space

```
Game Setup:
* Your spaceship malfunctions. You send a distress signal. It will take ONE YEAR for the rescue ship.

* Make a list of what you take onto the island for your one-year stay.
* Discuss your year. 
* Best list wins.

On Game Play:
Remember, the island has everything you need for basic survival. What would make your year better?  Tools? Books? Cooking gear? How about a lighter?


Game Variations:
* Passenger: You may also bring one other person. Who?
* Lower Energy: 100 pounds of stuff.
* Add Danger: weather, monsters, etc…
* More/Less Time: Two years? Three months?

## All Things Grow

```
This story takes as long to tell as a plant to grow.

Mother curls her hand — strong, calloused, beautiful — over yours. 
She has given you something — a sunflower seed. 
It presses against your palm. 
Her eyes shut.

Hold the seed, when you’re ready, plant it: 

Your mother is a babe. Pink and crying, feeding and growing.
Tell us about her home. What were her parents like?

When the first shoots arrive:

Your mother is a child. She is small and the world so big.
Tell us about her best adventures. How she was brave?

When the stalk grows strong, and leaves emerge:

Your mother is a teenager. Her territory grows. She is becoming more independent.
Tell us of her dreams. What is the future she hunts?

When the flower blooms:

Your mother atop the mountain she has climbed. 
She is all alone and all herself. She is smiling at the sun.
Tell us who your mother is. What limits has she shed?

Let the flower be. When you’re ready:

Cut it. 
Place it in a vase. That was your mother before you knew her. 
You don’t need the flower to know the rest of her story.

Grow.

## The day we were Free

```
	This game creates the narration a group of psychiatric patients produce to entertain a Visit. It revolves about their recent attempt to escape the asylum, how was their plan, what they did outside and how they were brought back.

	Players begin choosing their Patient's name and condition. Afterwards, they take turns Telling while the rest are Listening. At any point, a Listener can bid cigarettes to propose a question or add an interesting detail. If the Teller accepts, the Listener takes the Teller's place and elaborates.

	If the Teller gets boring, any bidder can propose a Chill Pill. When every available Chill Pill is being offered, or every Listener is offering one, the Teller will have to gulp one and resign its place to the highest bidder, getting no cigarettes. Bid cigarettes can be increased or decreased, Chill Pills can be taken back.

	Each Patient starts with five cigarettes (matchsticks). Begin with five Chill Pills (mints), the game ends when there are no more left.

	This Sunday, the Patients will tell the Visit the story of the Day they were Free.

## The Outsiders RPG

```
Those who know what is hidden protect the world. These Outsider characters are run by the players. Everything else is run by the Other.

Characters are a brief written description outlining look, attitudes, background, skills and experience. The group shares these descriptions and makes changes to their histories to link them to each other.

When a character tries something where failure would be interesting make an Action Roll: Player rolls 1, 2, or 3 D6s if their character is Unprepared, Ready, or Prepared (respectively) based on their character description and previous actions; Other rolls 1, 2, or 3 D6s for Stressful, Hard, or Long-shot actions (respectively); Player succeeds with one die higher than the Other’s highest. Two higher is a bonus and three higher is a crit. A tie means success with Difficulty or deadlock. Two dice under the Other’s top die is failure and Difficulty. Three under takes a character out (eg: KOed, flees in terror, mark makes public scene, etc).

Difficulty is a die added to Other rolls against that character. Difficulty is mental, emotional or physical stress that reduces character performance shown with coins or tokens placed on the character sheet and removed through meaningful character action.
```
<hr> 

## Fated Feud

```
Two RIVALS stand face-to-face and blade-to-blade! A third player is FATE.

Both rivals take five BREATH tokens. 

Secretly, FATE flips a coin to determine which rival they favor and records the name.

Every turn, flip a coin to determine which rival speaks first. Each rival describes an INDIGNITY that has driven them to duel. Then both players secretly and simultaneously spend BREATH in the following amounts to take one action:

0: BREATHE. (Gain one BREATH.)
1: PARRY. (Cancels an ATTACK or reduces FLOURISH damage by one.)
2: ATTACK. (Deals one damage.)
3: FLOURISH. (Cancels another FLOURISH; otherwise deals two damage.)

Rivals hold their action tokens in their fists. 

FATE chooses which INDIGNITY was most grievous. The aggrieved party earns a BREATH. If FATE chooses one rival three times in a row, the unchosen rival may CURSE FATE and remove them from the game.

Rivals reveal tokens simultaneously, resolve damage, then move to the next turn. Each turn, rivals describe the INDIGNITY that led them to commit the INDIGNITY their rival last described.

Each rival has seven health. Once a rival reduces their opponent to zero health, they win. If FATE’s favored rival wins and they are uncursed, they also win.

## The story of my life

```
A game for waiting in line in a public place.

You're dead. So are all those ahead and behind you in line. The queue for the after-life is long, slow, and winds through the living like torture, reminding you of what you no longer have. You do have your memories, well some of them. You will need to tell the arbiter your life story. 

Everyone has heard rumors of themes the arbiter appreciates. Share these rumors. 

It’s time to practice.


Take turns
Begin your saga with, "It all started when..."

Continue your tale until you reach a crossroads, where the details are fuzzy, request suggestions to impress the arbiter from your companions. Let the suggestions simmer as you listen to your companion’s tales. 

When it is your turn again, continue your story. Repeat crossroads as needed. 

When you reach your conclusion, finish with, "and that was the story of my life." 

Continue until all tales are told... or you've reached the arbiter. 



May your stories amuse and impress...

Prompts
Let the surrounding living and location inspire.
How/when/why did you die?
What did you die for?
Who will miss you?
What/who will you miss?
What was left behind?

## The Hands of Rasputin

```
Use one hand as your character - a rotting servant of Rasputin! Scuttle. Roll dice with other hand. 
Pick a Russian name. 

Your goals: hunt and kill the Romanovs to gain the most points! 

Turns: Choose a Romanov. Another player creatively narrates their castle escape attempt. You narrate your murder attempt, then roll the dice. 

Miming and/or Gory Description grant +1 each. 

Meet/beat the Romanov value to eliminate them. Also gain that many points:

Baby Alexei                 4
Princess Tatiana        5
Princess Maria           5
Princess Olga             5		
Tsar Nicholas II          6
Tsarina Alexandra      7	
Anastasia                    8

Failure: hide one finger.
You’re eliminated from the game when all your fingers are gone. 
Individual Romanovs escape if unsuccessfully attacked three times. 

Victory is yours when it is impossible for others to win!

Example turn: 
Player A chooses Nicholas.
Another Player: “The Tsar is attempting to escape through a sewer.”
Player A: (Miming actions +1) “I scuttle and flush myself down a toilet, then I crawl down his throat, choking his windpipe.” (Gory Description +1)
Player A rolls a 3, adds bonuses to get five - enough to eliminate Nicholas and gain his 6 points. 
Next player’s turn.

## Flesh of the Gods

```
A pantheon of Gods tell tales of their attributes and patronage.

Each player writes a:

- Divine domain (e.g. Storms, Agriculture, Cats)
- A treasured possession
- Body part

Players randomly select one domain, possession, and body part to create their God.

Players also write three prayers (i.e. requests of a God), these are shuffled into a deck. Prayers can be as grand, solemn, trifling, or selfish as you like.

The starting God is whoever last ate an apple. The player opposite is the Village Elder this round and draws a prayer. They beseech the God for aid, the God must use the powers of their domain to answer the prayer. The God to the Elder’s left jealously intrudes and adds a complication. The God to the beseeched God’s left uses their possession to help overcome the complication. The beseeched God now gains an additional domain based on the prayer and the next God is beseeched.

Second time around it is the Gods to the right of the Elder and beseeched God rather than the left.

On the final round no other Gods intervene, the beseeched God must sacrifice their body part in order to answer the prayer.

## Caution: Hot!

```
A semi-cooperative game for two players.

Make some tea.

While the tea's brewing:
    Together, think of two people (one per player) who're in a new relationship.
        In broad strokes, outline setting, situation, people.
    Individually, think about your character some more, add details.
        Write down four different long-term goals: Two life goals, two relationship goals.

Keep your goals secret!

The game's objects:
    Firstly, enjoy your tea.
    Secondly, fulfill at least seven goals.

When tea's served, take turns.
On YOUR turn:
    If no tea's left or it's gotten too cold to enjoy:
        Game over. Narrate an epilogue together (apart?); incorporate your (un)fulfilled goals.
    Else, let your tea cool/drink/refill your cup. Sketch a scene about one thing from the corresponding list (who/where/when/what/how/why).
        Either let your tea cool:
            - Spend time together.
            - They come closer to a revealed goal.
        Or drink from your cup:
            - Spend time with others.
            - They reveal a goal, then erase it. They write a new secret goal (they decide, no restrictions).
        Or refill your cup:
            - Spend time alone.
            - They reveal a goal.

On THEIR turn:
    Either
        drink from your cup, listening quietly.
    Or
        add to/change their narration, but don't drink.

## No Coincidence

```
Years ago, the world ended. You tell us how.
Both of us survived. I tell us why.
Both of us are walking across unpopulated lands. You tell us why.
We don't walk alone. We each say who we travel with, why they can't survive alone, and why we protect them.
In the distance, we spot each other. There is recognition: this isn't the first time we've crossed paths. I tell us how our last meeting started, you tell us how it ended.
We are dangerous people. You tell us why.
We haven't let the apocalypse take our humanity. I tell us why.
We are near each other now, us two and our companions. We each place a coin in our fist. Heads up, we are peaceful. Tails up, we are violent. We reveal our coins at the same time.
If I chose Heads, and you chose Tails, I tell us how you killed me, and you tell us why.
If you chose Heads, and I chose Tails, vice versa.
If we both chose Tails, you tell us how our companions go on without us.
If we both chose Heads, I tell us why we'll meet again.

## Why do I need a name?

```
One of you is new to this world. You could be an AI, a construct, a demon, an alien, a small child, a newborn dragon. No matter what, the world is strange and the people are stranger. Ask questions. 
  - Why is the sky orange? 
  - Why does your arm make buzzing and clicking noises when it moves?
  - Why did you put the sword through the guy with pointy hat and grey beard?

Keep asking follow up questions. When you understand respond with, “Thank you”. Now ask a new question to someone else.
-----------------------------------------
Everyone else
Who knows how you found this creature, you know what it is… but it is just now learning about you. It is strong and powerful and may just ruin your life some day, best keep it happy and teach it about this world so it can take care of itself, the world, and you.

Answer the questions to the best of your ability, or make something up, it’s not like the creature knows any better. The creature is impatient and mercurial, if you don’t have an answer ask for help from a companion.

## Talking Sticks

```
Every tree, every twig has a story, but no voice. This is a game about telling stories on their behalf.

Two or more players go into the woods and look for sticks. They must stay within earshot of each other. 

First one found becomes the talking stick. Its finder starts to talk about the stick. They describe who they are and what their stick is: wand, cudgel, primitive tool. Anything you could fashion from wood, enchanted (or not) in any way they desire. Then they tell a story about what their character is doing with their stick.

Anyone who finds a stick they think is longer than the talking stick can challenge it. They describe their character and say what their stick is. Then, they compare sticks. Longest stick wins and becomes the talking stick. Its owner describes how the challenge played out and continues the story.

Players may act out any part of the story, if they wish, using the sticks as props.

Once all players have had a talking stick, the current talker may end the story if they can think of a conclusion. Otherwise, continue until the the sticks or the stories run out.

## Boasters round the table

```

Boasters is a game for 3-5 players about a gang of old heroes reminiscing about their grand adventures.

1. Every player is handed one fate card.
2. The leader (rotated clockwise after each round) imagines an event the group did and starts the story. After one minute the other players each vote if they want the story to succeed or not. Each positive vote gives the leader a +1 to the roll, each negative gives a -1. The leader rolls two six sided dice to see if the story is true or not. 7+ for success, 6- for failure. 
3. If it’s a success the leader gets one boast point.If not then no point is given. The game moves on to the next player. The next player (counter-clockwise) has their turn continuing the story and telling the real truth and keeping the story going.
4.  After everyone has had a turn the next round begins and a new story begins
5. The game ends when one player has 5 points.

Fate cards can only be used once a round and give an additional +2 or -2 to a other players tale. You cannot use it on your own story.
```
<hr> 

## Medium Heavyweight

```
The players are the spirits of dead gamblers possessing a prizefighter. Spirits must reach a consensus to make the boxer act, but they've all bet differently on the outcome of the title fight.

First, each player secretly rolls a die and records the result. Evens they bet to win the fight, odds bet to lose.

Each round a timer is set for 20 seconds while players discuss strategy, then every player shuts up and writes an action on a slip of paper.

Punch: remove 1 HP from opponent
Clinch: regain 1 HP
Rope-A-Dope: the boxer loses 1 HP
Exorcise <player name>: remove named player from the game

If all actions submitted are different, or are all the same, the boxer is confused and loses 1 HP from being punched in the face.
If a majority of actions are the same, that action is performed.
If none of the above are true, the actions are placed in a hat and one is drawn at random to occur.

Both the boxer and the opponent have 3 HP. The opponent takes no direct action.

When either is reduced to 0 HP, each unexorsized player reveals their bet and wins or loses accordingly.
```
<hr> 

## Vain Superheroes

```
The superheroes have been defeated. The world now turns to unlikely saviors: celebrities. One player is The Nemesis (GM), who narrates their evil plan; the others choose their celebrity identities.

Government scientists have invented Super Serum, turning the chosen celebrities into a team of fame-seeking superheroes! While superheroes must work together to beat The Nemesis’s dastardly plot, only the superhero with the most Fame truly wins.

The players’ powers are only just starting to take shape. Going clockwise, give the next celebrity their super-identity and first superpower – make it hard for them to become famous! Every player starts with two vials of Super Serum; one extra goes to the player who gives the best identity. Throughout the game, vials of Serum can be injected in an ally to give them your choice of superpower.

Superheroes can overcome Challenges with their superpowers, rolling 3d6 against a Challenge Number (4-18) set by The Nemesis; this is set depending on how applicable the superpower used. On success, the player gains Fame equal to the Challenge Number. Otherwise, they are injured. Three injuries spells defeat; lose all Fame but keep playing!

## SMASH THE SYSTEM

```
Characters sneak into the domain of the corporate oligarchs, discover conspiracies, sabotage the machinery, steal files, and eventually bring the whole thing crashing down.

Core Mechanic: Whenever a character does something that might be noticed, they have to stack dice onto their tower. Stack 1 die for a quiet action like sneaking past a sleeping guard. Stack 2 for a dangerous action, like knocking out a few security cameras. 

When the dice tower collapses, players count the number of 1’s. These are “failures:”

0 failures: Whew! That was a close one. I guess no one heard that?
1-2: A nearby guard is alerted that a noise was made. Essentially the “?” state
3-4: One or two nearby guards are alerted and begin actively searching for the character. The “!” state
5+: A nearby guard radios in a disturbance and the entire area goes on high alert

When the players steal the files, throw the monkey wrench, or complete their objective, they knock over their towers. Each 5 or 6 rolled determines how effective / valuable their action was.

1-3: A small crack in the oligarchy
4-5: An expose of misdeeds, a critical file
6+: You’ve brought the company to it’s knees!

## A Game To Play When You Feel Hopeless

```
Things:
Some paper, pen. 
A trusted & supportive person to be your GUIDE.

Rules:
Share feelings and emotions HONESTLY to your GUIDE.
Your GUIDE is blind but they see the most clearly. You must show them everything through drawing and/or writing them down.

You are an ADVENTURER about to enter a dungeon where no other person has ever ventured into before. 


Prepare yourself and visualize the room you enter into.


Imagine one of your worst fears, failures as a DEMON and place it in the room. Prepare to engage.


DEMON attacks first with negative thoughts. Focus on each of them and write them down directly. Do not try to justify them.


Next you must relay the thoughts to your GUIDE. Talk with them and process the attacks together. You might feel uncomfortable, angry, and embarrassed. Try to explain why you feel those emotions.


When you feel stronger, face the DEMON again. If the attacks do not feel as intense then you have pacified it for now. Otherwise, repeat from 5.


Venture into the next room and repeat from 2.


You can exit the dungeon anytime you like. But when you reenter you must begin from the first room.

This game uses a standard 52-card playing deck. Each player starts with seven cards, and can keep them secret, or selectively reveal them at any time.

GAMEPLAY

The players are members of a doomsday cult, attempting to bring about the apocalypse. The GM narrates the story and describes the challenges the cult faces, drawing a card to represent each challenge, and placing it face down on the table.

Players must reveal a card from their hand to resolve each challenge, using its suit to help narrate their solution:

  - Clubs: Zealous cultists.
  - Spades: Arcane knowledge.
  - Hearts: Influence within society.
  - Diamonds: Funds and assets.

Show everyone the challenge card. Players who revealed a higher rank card of a different suit draw another card, discarding down to seven. Players who revealed a lower rank card (regardless of suit) must discard it, unless it’s their last.

ENDGAME

When the deck runs out of cards, the apocalypse begins! Everyone calculates their score, as if their cards were a poker hand. The GM does the same using the challenge cards.

If the GM wins, describe how the cult is thwarted. Otherwise, the player with the highest-ranking hand summons an Eldritch Abomination, and narrates the resulting apocalypse.

## They're just dice, right?

```
Four adventures enter an inn. They’re drawn to quiet corner with a small wood table.    Setting aside their gear they notice four odd looking dice on the table.    The Barbarian picks up the dice, examining them with a skilled eye.  

Nondescript but each movement of the dice produces a red glint. 

Unimpressed, the Barbarian tosses the dice back on the table.  With a red flash the doors to the inn bursts open.  A huge swamp troll scans the room and sees the four adventurers.  The troll charges the party; a massive hammer swinging wildly in the air.  “Hey, isn’t that…” Before the fighter can finish his statement he is flattened by the massive hammer with a sick sounding splat.  

Knocked off balance, the cleric hits the table causing its content to fly.  Instantly all four adventurers are sitting at the table with the Barbarian holding four dice in his palm.  
Unsure of what just happened, each adventurer glance around; no troll, no squashed fighter, nothing.  

The Barbarian lowers his hand, places each wood die softly on the table.  They slowly rise from the table heading to the door and quickly glance at the quiet little table in the back corner.

## Just Survive

```
The group defines the setting; the players just need to survive it.

Players roll a pool of D6 to overcome Obstacles that arise.
All characters begin with a pool of 3 d6.  Starting Resources are determined by backstory (3 or fewer).

Difficulty of checks is determined by the nature of the Obstacle:
Normal: 1 Success
Tough: 2 Successes
Hard: 3 Successes

A ‘Success’ is a result of 4 or higher.

Failing a roll removes a d6 from your pool.
Restore lost d6 by successfully helping others.

Players can co-operate and share 1 d6 - or turn their backs to save themselves.
If a roll is failed with a co-operator, the co-operator may volunteer their d6 be lost instead.

At character creation, players name a trait their character has. If that trait applies to a roll, they gain +1 bonus d6

Players may retrospectively expend a Resource to gain 1 bonus d6 - but must describe the Resource and how it is lost.

GM may award 1 Resource at their discretion on successes

If a character's pool reaches zero, they are gone forever.
A character may choose to sacrifice themselves to save another and donate their entire pool to aid another's roll.

## Flirt Party

```
Flirt Party 
for 20-50 players
by Johannes Oppermann

This is about daring to flirt. Bring your primary romantic partner. Don’t play if you hate watching them flirt! You don’t have a partner with you? Pick someone available, go on a 15 minutes date together and establish some history to play with.

Your partner picks your first flirt, you pick theirs. Start with the person your partner picked for you. Primary partners are off limits to each other until the endgame. A valid flirt is any unambiguous gesture of appreciation made towards a romantically compatible other person. Keep flirting until you run out of compatible partners.

Watch your primary partner while you flirt. Note who they flirt with, who flirts back, if you find them attractive yourself, and how you feel about it. Signal to your partner when you’re ready to end. When you’re both ready, leave for a private space.

Endgame: Sit with your primary partner and take turns describing what you saw. Compliment them on who flirted back, tell them who you found attractive. Be brief. End the game when both have mentioned everyone they saw. 

Congratulations, you have dared to flirt. If you’re still partners, you win!

## So You're Being Hunted

```
Follow these instructions, and you might just survive.
What’s in your pockets? That’s what you’ve got to work with. 
If you’re not already running, you should run. Now. 
Driving is fine so long as you’re not alone and someone else can read this to you.
What do you remember? How did this begin? 
And run.
1.Look at your surroundings. Don’t look back. What catches your eye? What about it reminds you of when it all went wrong?
And run.
2.Focus. What do you hear? How does it tell of the hunter’s approach?
And run.
3. Deep breath. What do you smell? What does it tell you about your hunter?
And run.
4. Be present. What’s that taste in your mouth? What feeling does it taste like? Is it yours?
And run.
5. Stay in the moment. As the air flows over you, what do you feel? Does it feel like escape? Like your fate is sealed?
And run.
Repeat steps 1 through 5 until you know you’re ready to fight or you can’t run anymore.
Confront your hunter with everything you have. 
What do you do? How?
Did you win? Did you escape?

## Memoriam Ignis

```
Magic is sad and beautiful. A chance to express yourself fully and make a difference, at the cost of your mind. Will you journey to make the world a better place? Or will you lord your powers over others? And more importantly, will you even still be "You" in the end?

Before your journey as a Wizard begins, commit to paper (Bond Paper recommended) your most treasured memories, enough to fill it with only a half-inch above, the sides, and bottom blank. Your SpellMaster (GM) then prepares a candle in front of you. As your journey starts he invokes the Spirit of Magic by bringing the candle alight. Your SpellMaster guides you on your odyssey and advises you in the manner in which your memories must be kindled in the Spirit of Magic to bring your spells to life. The more complex the spell you've described, the longer your memories stay wreathed in the Spirit of Magic and burned away. 

At the end of your adventure, when your SpellMaster extinguishes the Spirit of Magic, check how much you still remember of your old life. Are you still you? Are you better? Are you worse? And was it worth it?

## Goblins in a Trenchcoat

```
Host, explain to your audience that they are a crew of tiny aliens inside a humanoid robot, a host of spirits within the mind of some poor victim, or a stack of goblins in a trenchcoat.

Explain the tricky position the group finds themselves in and what their goal is and that they are only ever able to perform these four actions:

1) Violence       | 2) Flight
-------------------------------------
3) Interrogation  | 4) Resolution

Explain the immediate situation and poll your audience to decide on one of the four actions. If there is a draw, choose the action with the lowest number from the tied choices. Once an action is chosen, roll a d4. If the result of the d4 is the same as the chosen action, the action is successful without complication. If the d4 result shares only a single axis with the chosen action, that action is only partially successful or the success comes with a cost. If the d4 result shares no axes with the chosen action, that action is unsuccessful and the situation becomes worse. Narrate what happens until another action is required and then poll again. Continue until the group achieves their goal or the situation becomes untenable.

## Scry and Rescue

```
http://www.theonion.com/article/investigators-first-48-hours-most-critical-locatin-53174

Adults cannot enter the Wardrobe Realms.  Only children can save children.

GM & 3-5 players.
Everyone creates one Wardrobe faction -- Snow Queen, Dwarves, Quaddies, Dragons, Playing Cards, Pirates… then name the Realm.

Each child agent survived and escaped a Wardrobe Realm, once.
Pick two factions & fellow agents, and say for each if you are a...

Fortress -- calls, strengthen them.
Friend -- knows, act like them. 
Fright -- commands, harms them.


When you face your past, suffer: (pick your usual three)
Fear, recklessness, anger, depression, emotional shutdown, reenactment, regression, guilt, paranoia, defiance, obsession, pleasure-seeking.

The Agency is: Government (CPS?), Private Business, Clandestine, Church or Charity

The Agency seeks the Lost Child.  You must...

Find: are they hidden, transformed, guarded, integrated?
Free: bargain, fight, perform ritual, sneak.
Escape: flee, destroy, barricade, trick pursuers. 
Return: reintegrate, enlist, study, or mourn the lost.

...but the Scrying was: incomplete, misleading, compromised (by who?), years out of date (time dilation).

When you face trials, roll:
1d6 for each agent in danger.
1d6 for each relationship acted on.
Pairs succeed, or stave off complications or PTSD reactions.
Runs of 3+ create upcoming problems.
Triples create new relationships -- or stop PTSD even if alone.

The criminal stands trial.

If you cannot catch the criminal within the chosen worlds or miss a
device activation window, the multiverse collapses.

## Rules lawyers

```
Rules Lawyers
is a game about making the rules via common law.

Each game begins with this Constitutution:

1.Parliament shall make rules, and the Court will interpret them.
2.The first session shall be one where Parliament convenes to decide on amendments. Every 2 hours in the game session, Parliament shall reconvene to write more amendments.
3.Amendments pass when half or more players vote in favour of it.
4.Parliament is all the players in the game. A GM will be nominated  amongst the players.
5.The GM will run the game and make up the rules of the game until someone registers disagreement with it.
6.Where disagreement is registered the Court shall decide the matter with the rules of the Constitution and previous precedent in mind. The Court is randomly selected from among the players and may not be the player who registered disagreement or the GM. They are the Claimant and Defendant respectively.
7.Where Parliament has not written a rule, the Court may develop a new rule. Parliament reserves the right to change the rules through Amendments.
8.A player may win this game.

## Why We Hunt

```
Your group gathers around the table to retell the story of their latest hunt. What you hunted, and how, will be revealed over time.

On scrap paper, write down the following:
Attributes
Strength
Speed
Smarts
Luck
Hunter’s Code: Write your personal code as a hunter (Example: Never stop the hunt, even if my legs give out)
Trophy 1, Trophy 2

Go around the table and describe your hunter, starting with a name and description. Choose a player to go first, they are the StoryTeller. The StoryTeller begins by setting the scene of the hunt, creating any details they want. At any point, a player can cross off one of their Trophies and inject a complication/question into the story. The StoryTeller crosses off one of their Attributes or Code, describing how it got them out of the bind. They may no longer use that in the hunt. The role of StoryTeller then goes to the next clockwise player. The hunt continues until all players have marked off their Trophies, or the group agrees the hunt was a challenging and satisfying one indeed. What will you hunt next?

<hr> 

## Cyber Beetles

```
The players are a couple in a cyperpunk world, both 100% flesh and bone. Begin by describing themselves: emotionally and physically, of their flaws and strengths in a world where augmentations to fix problems are available.

They take it in turns rolling a D6. Depending on the rolls, they will go in for surgery to have a body part replaced by something synthetic or metal. They will describe the effects of the new limb, difficulties faced, its style, etc. Akin to the game Beetle/Cootie. Consult the table below for each roll!

1: Replace right arm.
2: Replace right leg.
3: Replace left arm.
4: Replace left leg.
5: Replace torso. 
6: Replace head (only applicable once all other body parts have been replaced).

If a player rolls a number that they’ve rolled previously, the relevant body part malfunctions, and must be repaired. The player will then explore the process, implications, and consequences. If a player rolls a 6 early, explore the character’s desires and anxieties about replacing their body.

The game ends once a player has replaced their entire body. It is up to the players whether this is good or bad.

## World of Stats

```
EVERYONE:
What kind of Fiction do you want?
Discuss setting, goals, themes, tone, ridiculousness.

PLAYERS:
What is your +2 Stat? +1? -1? Write them on your (index) Card.
Stats can be anything: roles, skills, equipment, resources, concepts, like “Tough”, “Obscura”, “Bullets”, “Chaotic”, “Disenfranchisement”, “Beheading”.

The MC will guide a conversation about the Fiction.
Ask the MC about things.  
Say what you want to do.
Play to find out what happens.

When you do something with an important and uncertain outcome, describe your attempt and roll 2D6 plus/minus a Stat; the MC will say which.
On a...
10+, Success; MC might increase a Stat, maybe get a new +1 Stat. What is it?
7-9, Success with Complication in the Fiction.
6-,  Failure with Complication; a Stat might decrease, or get a new -1 Stat.

When Stats change, skip 0, and don’t go past +/-4.

When the Cards have no more room, how does the Fiction conclude?

MC:
Extrapolate from the Stats.
Challenge the Stats.
Describe changes to Stats.
Make interesting Complications.
Make outcomes matter.
Make new rules if you learn them.

## Caltrops

```
You are an expert thief with a trusty bag of caltrops who has (almost) completed a big heist. The guard chases you through the city, so escape or face capture. Choose a specialization which provides a dice pool of d4 and a special ability. 

1. Thief, 10d4. Spend a d4 to avoid combat. 
2. Swashbuckler, 8d4. Spend a d4 to parry and riposte. 
3. Arcane Trickster, 6d4. Spend a d4 to cast a minor illusion.
4. Assassin, 4d4. If Completely Successful on a kill, return a d4 to your pool

To complete a task, choose and roll a number of dice from your pool, then, count the number of fours (successes). Spend up to 2 successful d4 from the pool. 

0 – Failure
1 – Partially Successful
2 – Completely Successful

A “Flurry” occurs when one die remains, add all spent dice back to the pool then immediately roll them. On a failure, there is a major complication and you reduce your dice pool by half. Successes should be glorious and do not remove dice from the pool. Continue the chase. 


If your total dice pool is reduced to 1d4, you are captured. After two consecutive successful “Flurries” you escape. 

```
<hr> 

## One Last Job

```
A story-telling heist game for players and GM.

Players assume the roles of:
The muscle
The hacker
The cat burglar
The driver
Or other heist tropes. 

Players take turns drawing cards and explaining their scene. Each suit corresponds to an event type, the higher the rank, the harder the challenge:

Clubs are obstacles that character must accomplish, set by the GM. Players explain how they will deal with the obstacles, then roll:
2d6 >= card value = success.
Items/loot can be added before rolling. 

Hearts are flashbacks to explain a connection to the job or another player character. Higher card, the more emotional the scene should be. 


Diamonds are loot. Loot can be used to explain resources used in obstacles or flashbacks. The Ace is the maguffin needed to win the game.

Spades are the law. Similar to clubs but are people. Each success adds a 1-point disadvantage to future spade rolls. 

The game is won when a club card is played, the King, Queen and Jack of clubs have been played, and players have the ace of diamonds.

Players are eliminated if they lose a spade encounter. If the whole team is eliminated, the game is lost.

## Sonder

```
sonder: realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own.

game about the extras of everyday life
an exercise of empathy to strangers

get a domino set
divide the pieces equally between participants.
each piece is a character sheet with traits and connections. 

first player puts a piece of choice on the center of the table, saying: 

“I'm...__(N)__.” 

using N words to describes their character, where N = one of the numbers [0-6] on half domino piece.

then, describes an everyday life scene for their character.

next, other participantes may ask one question about that character, clockwise.

 *if (N) is the lowest choosed number, player answer the question; 
 *if (N) is the highest, other participants respond;
 *If they’re equal, alternate.

all are encouraged to build on previous answers.

when turn ends, next player connects one of their pieces to the other half, if they can [if not, skip], and starts another turn: new character, same rules applying. 

except that this new character has to had witnessed in some way the last scene, as a passerby, having made eye contact.

game ends when all pieces are rhizomatically connected on the table.

## Botany Bay

```
In the cut-throat world of 18th century botany, ensure scientific immortality by discovering the rarest plants.

Each botanist takes a sheet of paper and four Favours per botanist lecturing. Fold the sheet into four sections. Draw the following elements:
      A flower
      A leaf
      A root
      A seed

Describe each element with adjectives- “poisonous”, “stimulating”, “red”, up to ten across the plant.

In turn, botanists gives a short lecture on one element of their plant, referring to the illustration and description. Their audience may:
     1. Applaud- place Favours (up to the amount of nouns and adjectives) on the 
         element’s illustration. Reasons for applause might include:
              It is unusual or exotic;
              It is useful to society or industry, or to harm or heal;
              You’re playing politics, despite the dull nature of their plant.
     2. Scoff- discard two Favours to ridicule a claim and remove an existing 
         Favour given as applause.

Botanists may pool Favours to meet these costs.
Fierce debate is encouraged.
Proceed until every lecture has been heard, every Favour is spent, or until boredom sets in.

The botanist with the most Favours on their plant (minus any remaining Favours they still hold) is declared President of the Royal Botanical Society.

## Planetary Realtors

```
“How about this lovely little ice planet with unbeatable views of an exploding star…”

A game for a team of buyers representing a civilization in the market for a new planet, and at least one planetary realtor.

The buyers explain their reason for buying, and the realtor presents the buyers with three flawed planets in turn. The buyers find further problems with each planet and provide additional requirements related to their intended purpose for the planet. Really try to pick holes in the proposed planet, and be awkward with your additional needs. The realtor should try to play down the planet’s issues and find ways to satisfy the requirements.

If there is more than one realtor, they can represent the same three planets or they can have their own planets. Either way, they are competing for the sale.


The buyers roll for the basis of their needs:
  1  Farming
  2  Industry
  3  Leisure
  4  Military
  5  Mining / Resources
  6  Prison / Containment
  7  Refuge / Expansion
  8  “Science”

The realtor rolls for the basis of each planet’s main flaw:
  1  Dangerous location
  2  Extreme temperature
  3  Geological instability
  4  Habitation
  5  Radioactivity / Toxicity
  6  Sci-Fi weirdness
  7  Value to others
  8  Wildlife

## Who Am I To You?

```
Two players, each roleplaying someone in a long-term romantic partnership.

First, collectively create a thematically varied playlist of songs about relationships. 

Then, tell the story of your initial meeting, in character, like you are telling it to someone else at a party.  

Write “first meeting” on a sheet of paper and have an out-of-character conversation about your feelings about the scene. Collectively write a short description of it.

Press shuffle on your playlist. Listen to the first song, occasionally making eye contact with the other player. When it finishes, roleplay a brief moment in the life of the characters’ relationship, with the song as inspiration. Let these questions guide you:
-Where are we? What are we doing?
-How much time has passed since the last scene?
-What has changed?
-What are our conflicts? Our joys?

When the scene ends, write down a name for it. Have an out-of-character conversation about the scene. Collectively write a short description of it.

Repeat until the playlist ends or you reach a logical conclusion.

When you finish, read what you have written. Then, take turns looking the other person in the eye, asking “Who am I to you,” and answering that question in character.

## Rewrite

```
The first book was a roaring success. You have the adulation of millions of fans. Can you strike gold a second time? Or are you a one-hit wonder?

You’re parts of the author’s psyche: roll individually to see which STORY ARC you’re after.

Take turns producing a paragraph of story, rolling to incorporate a PLOT ELEMENT.

The publisher wants changes! Once everyone’s had a turn pick another section then change it, according to an EDIT roll. Continue until a result comes up a fourth time.

ROLL  STORY ARC                       PLOT ELEMENT               EDIT
1     Rags to Riches (rise)           Narrow Miss                Make it more like the first book
2     Riches to Rags (fall)           Moment of Levity           Punch it up a bit!
3     Man in a Hole (fall then rise)  Exposition                 Change up the character roles
4     Icarus (rise then fall)         Tempting Offer             Add another PLOT ELEMENT (roll)
5     Cinderella (rise-fall-rise)     Conflict                   Move a section. Edit for continuity
6     Oedipus (fall-rise-fall)        Character Defining Moment  Make it less like the first book

-SCORING-

6pts divided among those with the final STORY ARC.
2pts for going first.
1pt per first book reference.
-1pt per inconsistency added.
1pt if an EDIT got laughs.

Argue over what counts.

## Steampunk Serial

```
Reborn in a caste gated steampunk world, but to the lowest caste, Player A is furious that the higher castes are keeping secrets from the rest. Their last caste was archivist’s, which kept the secrets.

Player A’s character chooses to murder people to get the knowledge shared.

Player A uses 3D6 to choose what past lives they remember, and those are skillsets they use to commit these murders. (textiles, smithing, herbology, husbandry, woodworking, innkeepers)

Other players play Keepers Of The Law and Expert Citizens (choosing the caste of their expertise with a D6), and must catch Player A.

The first keeper’s (2nd player) is the senior partner & suspects that people are remembering past lives.

The second and junior keeper (3rd player) sees patterns in things.

The 4th & 5th players are expert witnesses called in by the keepers.

Any players beyond that play more keepers or experts.

Player A wins if they can commit all 6 murders without getting caught.

The other players win if they catch them prior to murder 6.

GM knows all & all players roll a die to see what number they are, but players only know who keepers and experts are.

Create a Character and setting where it lives in. No relation between Characters is needed. Pieces representing each Character are placed on opposite sides of the board. Add the *cover to the board so Players see only their half (think battleship).

 
Both Players repeat at the same time:

[

Player A tells Player B a Theme relevant to A’s Character.
Player B sends media(pictures, video…) representing each possible next move for B’s Character (Characters move 1 step) to Player A. All moves start unmarked. For unmarked moves, choose a media according to the theme received, and mark the board (easily done with pieces of paper). For marked moves, send the representing media.
Player A chooses one received media, and Player B moves his Character accordingly.

]
Until Character(s)… :

 
…reaches the edge of the board(Except the starting Edge): 
Something bad happens. Describe it, and reposition your Character somewhere it has been before.


…crosses the middle: 
Worlds meet, and Characters see each other. Remove the cover. Players shouldn’t be able to tell which media represents which move.


…are next to each other:  
Describe their meeting. Congrats!

## S.P.Q.R.

```
Split the players into two teams. Each team must decide upon a Dictator. If there is a disagreement over who becomes the Dictator, declare both players Co-Dictators. Each Co-Dictator has a veto on the other’s actions.

Begin by consulting the sacred chickens: All players roll 1d6. If all players roll a 3 or above, the chickens feed, and the Battle begins. If a player rolls below a 3, the chickens do not feed, and all players re-roll.

If the sacred chickens do not feed three times, a Dictator may renounce their gods, rolling 1d6. If they roll a 6, the sacred chickens are thrown overboard and the Battle begins. If the Dictator rolls a 5 or below, they are assassinated by their soldiers, and their team loses the Battle.

Once in Battle, begin a Skirmish. Both teams play rock-paper-scissors. Defeated players are removed from the Field until one team emerges victorious. If a Dictator is defeated, their team loses the Skirmish, regardless of how many players remain on the field.

If a team loses three Skirmishes, they are routed from the field, losing the Battle.

If five Skirmishes pass and neither team wins, retreat to your camps for winter.

## Coming Close To Home - A Workshop

```
A workshop for prosaic games.
One facilitates the workshop – but all partake in Theme and Tale.
This is played in order.
 
-Theme-
Talk about themes in your game.

Facilitator points at someone.
That person says a word that springs to mind Immediately. No thinking. Then they point.
Proceed when there is flow.

-Tale-
Get an object.
Make two hand signs.

One for Zoom.
When used, the Speaker “zooms” in/out, interpreting it as they will – camera, feelings, perspective. No zoom police.

Another for Give
When used, the Speaker gives the object to another and becomes the Lens.

The person holding the object is the Speaker. Look at the Lens.
The Lens uses hand signs to direct the Speaker. Go slow.

Tell a coherent tale together.
Facilitator says 1 phrase, gives the object, becoming the Lens.

Proceed when it feels right.

-The Door-

Facilitator, speak dwellingly, slowly.
                       Bid them:
                       Close their eyes.
                       Breathe deeply.

Bid them Imagine a door.  Its…
               	       Shape
                       Texture

Bid them imagine a person is coming to the door. their...
                   	Steps
                      	Knocking, opening the door.
                       	Face
		        Body
                       Mannerisms                                   	
                     	Occupation.
                     	How they breathe

Bid them
                        Synchronize breath and mimic that person
                        Open their eyes.

That’s their character.

## Into Balance

```
Good or bad, the only guarantee is that your luck will someday reverse… The Universe will not bow to you. It craves only equilibrium. And sooner or later it will pull you back… Into Balance. 

This supplement is intended provide an alternative to dice rolling in systems Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA).

Convert your PbtA Stats into Gems by adding 2. For example, a +1 Stat becomes Three Gems.

Gather 35 gems in one colour and 65 in another. They should be otherwise identical. Place them all in a cloth bag.

When presented with a challenge, instead of rolling two dice, draw gems from the bag equal to your relevant Gems statistic.
You may draw blindly: If you draw one gem of the first colour, you have succeeded. If you draw two, you have succeeded greatly. (To the GM: A success is equivalent to a 7-9 result, a great success is a 10+)
You may guarantee failure: You may choose to draw only gems of the second colour for an action, guaranteeing failure to improve your odds later.

Once draw is resolved, set gems aside.

When the bag is empty, the universe is satisfied. Are you? Refill and be reborn.

## Strongman: Authoritarian Fun For 3+ Players

```
Each player is the Authoritarian ruler of their own country. On your turn you will announce a new Policy for your country. Will you require a certain minority to register with your government? Remove some group of undesirables from your voting rolls? Whatever you choose, be aggressive. Be strong.

During your turn, the other players represent your Parliament and must indicate whether they protest or support your decree. They do this by simultaneously dropping or not dropping a token, chosen in secret, with the following results:

0 protests - Score a point; Announce another Policy
1 protest - The protesting swine is sent to the Gulag; Announce another Policy
2+ protests - Parliament's loyalty is weak; Your turn ends
100% protest - You are Overthrown; Your turn ends

Gulag
Parliamentarians sent to the Gulag lose their next Announcing turn and voting eligibility for the remainder of the current turn.

Overthrown
If you are Overthrown you lose all your accumulated points.

One Parliamentarian Left
When only one Parliamentarian remains eligible to vote, you receive a 3 point bonus for stifling the opposition. Your turn ends.

Endgame
The first to reach 13 points is embraced as Big Brother, beloved by his people. Everyone else loses.

## Do You Drink the Kool-Aid

```
One Cult Leader, stat Zeal (5). Goal: convince Cultists to suicide (fictionally).
One Investigator, stat Alarm (5). Goal: convince Cultists to escape.
Remainder Cultists, stat Doubt (5). Goal: protect the cult.

Each turn, Leader makes Pronouncement (any statement). Investigator asks Leader and each Cultist questions about Pronouncement. Based on answers, characters’ stats change based on table. Each Cultists’ Doubt changes based on their response, Leader’s Zeal and Investigator’s Alarm change based on majority of Cultists’ response.

             Cultists Lie  Truth
Leader Lie   -1 Alarm      +1 Alarm
             +1 Doubt      +1 Doubt
             +1 Zeal       -1 Zeal
       Truth -1 Alarm      +1 Alarm
             -1 Doubt      -1 Doubt
             -1 Zeal       +1 Zeal

At end of any round, may do the following:
* Cultist attempts Flee. Roll 1d10+Doubt vs Leader’s 1d10+Zeal, If cultist’s roll is higher, they flee, otherwise, -1 Doubt.
* Investigator can Intervention one Cultist. Investigator rolls 1d10+Alarm vs cultist’s 1d10-Doubt. If investigator rolls higher, cultist escapes. Otherwise cultist -1 Doubt.

After >8 rounds, Leader can Pronouncement Suicide. Remaining Cultists have one chance to resist. Leader makes one 1d10+Zeal roll, each Cultist rolls 1d10+Doubt. Any Cultist who rolls higher than Leader resists, watches rest in horror.

## Living With Humans

```
You play as magical shapeshifting animals pretending to be humans in the modern world. You can shift between your human and animal form, and use magic to create illusions, manipulate nature, or do other trickster-ish things. 

You have two stats, called Mundane and Myth. Both start at 1.  

Whenever you try to do something difficult, roll 1d6 and add one of your stats; use mundane if you solve the problem through regular human means, use Myth if you solve the problem with your magic or your animal side. If the total is 6 or higher, you succeed. If the die rolls a 6, increase the stat you used by 1. 

If your Mundane reaches 5, you become fully human, lose your powers, and forget about ever being an animal. If your Myth reaches 5, you become an invisible spirit, and use your magic to play tricks on humans.

GMs, choose one thing from each list below and describe how each is a problem:
Mundane: Home, Money, Job, Love, Friends, Law 
Myth: Spirit, Debt, Curse, Monster, Shrine, Dream

Play until you resolve both problems, or all characters reach 5 in one of their stats.
```
<hr> 

## Doors

```
"You all stepped out your doors and into a whole other world. Now you must work together to find your way home."

COMPONENTS: Pencils & Paper. 2d6.

SETUP: 

Write your character name and description. Draw 6 unlabeled attribute boxes, and assign each a different value from 1 to 6.

PLAY: 

Randomly choose a player to be GM. They assign new labels to the 6 attribute boxes and describe the world players find themselves in.

Players act according to their new attributes while exploring this world, meeting NPCs, and finding their way home.

If taking an action with a reasonable chance of failure, or one which is opposed, the involved character(s) must pass a test. The GM determines the relevant attribute and circumstance modifier (positive or negative). The player(s) roll 2d6, then add the attribute value, modifier, and any relevant item modifiers. For unopposed tests, 12+ succeeds. For opposed tests, the higher total wins.

Players are human, and can handle minor damage, but serious injury results in lasting effects or death.

If players enter a door or analogue, they enter a new world. Immediately choose a new GM, who assigns new attribute labels and describes the next world to explore.

## Your journey

```
“The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.”

You are survivors in an apocalyptic wasteland, travelling between isolated cities in search of a place from your dreams. You never stay longer than three days. This game tells the story of the places you encounter on the way.

Character creation:
- Pick a unique quality and declare three ways you use it.
- Pick a flaw and explain why it haunts you.
- Pick a bond with someone and describe how you rely on them.

To start playing, think of some aspect of society and enlarge, twist, or reverse it. You arrive at a place where the people are like that. You try to understand those people and learn from them. You can observe them, interact with them, or fight them, but you never become one of them.

When you arrive, you have three tokens. Tell the others what you observe. When you learn something new, gain a token. To intervene, describe what you do. Either someone tells you what goes wrong and gives you a token, or you do it and discard a token. If you run out of tokens, you must leave this place, NOW.

life” rolled by person in the beginning for him/her to be happy
with in future life.

## Werewolf

```
To create a character you must choose skills. Any skill you can justify can exist. Each skill is tied to either your wolf side or your human side, determine this when creating the skill. Choose four tier 1 skills, three tier 2, two tier 3, and one tier 4. You have 2 stats, wolf and man. Both start at level 4.
Checks are resolved by rolling a number of dice equal to the tier of the skill, then gauging how many are greater than or equal to the success rating which is the level of the skill’s corresponding stat. The number of successes is compared to a number determined by the gm.
Skills increase by both succeeding and failing at them a number of times equal to the next tier's value, new skills can be acquired this way.
Keep track of how many times you use skills tied to Wolf or Man. For every 5 difference the skill used more decreases by 1 and the other increases by 1. Upon either stat reaching 7 your character leaves the game, either losing their humanity or their werewolf abilities.
GM: challenge players to find balance between Wolf and Man.

## A Day in the Life of a Mole Person

```
	Players have: 
•	6d personal resource counter. Ticks down one at day’s end unless resources scavenged. Set to 6. Character dies when personal counter reaches 0.
•	4d daily radiation modifier.

	Group has:
•	20d group resource counter. Ticks down # of players X1 at day’s end unless resources scavenged. Set to 3X # of players, this is the max (e.g. 5 players = 15 max, ticks down 5 daily). Everyone dies if group counter reach 0.
•	6d for scavenge and defense rolls.

	Describe nuclear wasteland:
•	Characters
•	Setting/Map
•	Enemy(s)

	Outset of day, for group: 
•	Decide on location to explore and needed resources. 
•	All roll personal radiation modifier. Subtract from scavenge (irradiated brain fog). Add to defense (mutant strength).

	Daily actions:
•	Players scavenge once. Player describes scavenging. Roll 6d minus modifier. 2-5 = success.
•	Success = player chooses. Hide resource (no personal tick down, add one instead) or contribute to group (first contributed scavenge = no group counter tick down. Second = uptick 1X # of players).
•	If scavenge fails, group describes attack. Roll 6d plus modifier. 6+ = attack defended. 2-5 = attacker injures player (player ticks personal counter down one).

## Marked

```
For two players -- powerful witches, locked in battle.

Materials: two markers.

Each witch chooses an aspect under their control -- fire, plants, time, etc. Draw a sigil for that aspect on the back of your non-dominant hand. When both players are ready, continue below.

The game is played in real time. Witches cast spells at each other by drawing sigils on their non-dominant arm -- more powerful spells require larger/more complex sigils. The spell is cast once the sigil is complete. The spell must be related to the sigil you drew (though make sure not to invoke any real magic) -- describe how you manipulate your aspect to attack your enemy, or provide a shield for later use, or serve any appropriate narrative purpose.

The game is over when one witch has killed the other, or both have surrendered. You are forced to surrender when your non-dominant arm runs out of space to draw on.

## GHOST//BODY: Road Warrior Repossessors

```
We are hideous ghosts, every one of us. Hoping for flesh to reinvigorate and inspire us. But big money controls the meat, and so controls us.

Enter RoWR. Road Warrior Repossessors: reclaiming auto bodies and human bodies. Real-vid stars; teams competing for likes and subscribers, dash- and shoulder-cams glorifying their story.

Flesh is clothing: borrowed; bought; stolen. Your ghost and footage are your own.


Get Traits: 3 words each, detailing…
    Your hideous ghost.
    Collectively, the crew’s wheels.

Who finds your ghost beautiful? Why?

#Get Flesh#
    Crewmate: Describes your body. How’s it gorgeous?
    Different crewmate: Describes the acquisition. Complications?
    Who finds it handsome? Why?

Choose Spirit or Somatics: +1d8 when rolling it.


Roll 3d8 plus…
    Spirit to get clever, subtle, willful, ghostly.
    Somatics for driving, physicality, passion, violence.
… +1d8 if a vehicle Trait applies.

Each 4+ is Ace, 1s are Trouble, otherwise a Flop.
Troubles cancel out Aces.
Evoke each personal Trait once per session to reroll any Troubles.
Assign uncancelled Aces to… 
    Things go as planned. Otherwise, how’d you screw up?
    You didn’t get hurt. Otherwise, what kinda hurt?
    Your hideous ghost stays hidden. Otherwise, how’d it get 
      complicated?
More Troubles than Aces? Big damage. Full-body rejection:

## Maximum Efficiency

```
Maximum Inefficiency, The Game

Maximum Inefficiency is a game for three or more players. The object of the game is to complete a simple task in a random, elevated number of individual non-repeatable actions, with emphasis on ridiculous solutions.
 Play begins by the players rolling two d6. The highest roller begins the game. That player becomes the Activity Director, who describes the start and end of a simple task.The Activity Director then rolls two d6 and adds six to the result. This number then defines the maximum number of actions required to fulfill the task.

Moving around the table clockwise, all the other players describe the method they use to fulfill the task. They may not repeat an action while describing the task, nor use more actions than rolled. After the player to the right of the Activity Director finishes his description, all players at the table then decide which player has made the most ridiculous solution to the problem. That player is awarded a point, and the next player clockwise becomes the Activity Director. Play continues until all players have been Activity Directors twice, after which the person with the most points wins.

## Descending from the Shoulders of Giants

```
You'll need:
A Guide & 2 to 6 players
index cards & pens

Each player writes a sentence describing a pivotal event in their character's life on their index card. A pivotal event is some form of conflict that changes the character's life. The events are kept secret for now.
One player is nominated to be the Descendant ("main character"); the others are automatically the Ancestors.
The Descendant reveals their pivotal event and starts roleplaying the scenario with the Guide.
While the current player role-plays, Ancestors can reveal their pivotal event and send one related thought or suggestion to any living being in that scene.
To see how the suggestion affects the current situation, the current event is paused and the Ancestor role-plays their pivotal event with the Guide. When the event is resolved, the previous event resumes.
Any elements from the Ancestor's events can now be brought into this scene.
It is suggested that Ancestors' events only go two layers deep to help keep things simple.
Once the Descendant's event is resolved, the game is complete.
Ancestors then sit back, content that they have helped their Descendant stand on the shoulders of giants.

## ✗amurai

```
Material: 25 Scrabble tiles, every letter except [S]

For each player:

The Samurai is a powerful being, holder of the Storied Sword.
This legendary weapon can grant its owner a single wish.
The only way to possess it is to defeat the current holder in a duel.

You need this wish. Why?

Draw a random letter [✗]. 
You’re now the ✗amurai – ✗murai if vowel.
Every choice you now make must start with letter ✗.

Choose your ✗-Weapon. (Bow, Zanbatō…)
How does it reflect your personality?

Choose your ✗-Totem. (Blood, Zebra…)
How does it help you in battle?

Choose your ✗-Weakness. (Blind, Zonked…)
Does it make you look badass?

The Samurai invited all their challengers to meet them.
But once there, you only see the other ✗amurais.
Is the Samurai one of them?

The GM hands you a secret letter.
[S] means you’re the Samurai in disguise.
Why are you hiding? Have you already made your wish?

✗amurais’s actions are always a success.
If it involves their ✗-Weakness, always a failure.

When ✗amurais are opposed, each draw a random letter.
Draw one more when ✗-Totem is advantageous.
The letter closest to [A] wins.
✗amurais may survive only one wound.

## Road Trippin’ on a Playlist

```
Get as many friends as you can fit into a car and ask yourselves “Where should we go?” – agree on a destination. Each traveler makes up a character: write their name and a short descriptive sentence. Shuffle characters so that nobody gets a character they created.

Make a playlist. Each traveler chooses two musics:
     - One that your character loves
     - One that relates to the destination somehow

Choose other tracks you’d like to add to it with any themes. Three musics in total per traveler are recommended. Do not reveal them to other travelers.

Now get into the car (or simulate one), fasten your seatbelts and start the engine! The shotgun puts the playlist on shuffle and the driver takes on the wheel.

When a music plays, follow these rules:
     - If your character loves it, have a conversation about what you’ll do at the 
       destination
     - If it relates to the destination, the driver speaks about the route – how 
       close/far from the destination are you and why?
     - For other musics, backseat travelers come up with a situation based on it

The shotgun may skip tracks if the conversation is stale.
You arrive at your destination when the playlist ends!

## Those Who Fled

```
3 to 5 players play the leaders of a community that escaped servitude under the Empire, into foothills where massed patrols of legionnaires can't follow.

Another player, the Adversary, plays the Empire, nature, and the spirit world.

Character creation: Name an advantage you have (eg: a skill, a type of magic, a weapon). The Adversary then names a threat (eg: a scarcity of food, a wandering Imperial patrol).

Threats have 11 strength by default; +3 during their season: Summer for the Empire, Winter for nature, Fall for the spirit world.

Each scene is a season, starting with Spring. Players take turns establishing a scene where they strike against threats. During Winter, the adversary establishes a scene instead.

Resolve challenges by rolling 3d6 against the strength of the threat you're struggling against. If you have an advantage, or if you are choosing to hide and escape instead of fighting, roll 4d6 instead and drop the lowest die.

At the end of each season:

- Decide whether the threat is defeated or becomes stronger (+1 strength).
- If all threats are defeated, the players narrate an ending.
- If a threat has 15 or more strength, the Adversary narrates an ending.

## Justice Court TV

```
What you need: 3 or more players, a TV show or movie to watch, and a timer.

Turn on and mute a show or movie. Designate one player as the Plaintiff and another as the Defendant, a third player becomes the Judge. Additional players become Witnesses. The Judge picks a case subject and it's time to play.

During play, the Plaintiff and Defendant take turns debating the case while doing voice overs for various characters that appear on TV. The Plaintiff and the Defendant are encouraged to call on Witnesses to help bolster their side of the case.

Set the timer to an agreed time, several minutes is suggested, the discussion ends when the alarm sounds and the Judge decides the winner of the case. The winner becomes the new Judge, picking the next case and choosing the show/movie.

Example Case:
Defendant ruined Plaintiff’s time machine by taking it back in time and a t-rex broke the am radio antenna.

21+ Rules: The Judge can deal out a punishment to the losing side and their Witnesses in the form of a number of sips of an alcoholic drink. Sips are determined by the roll of a six-sided die.

## Fear the Conspiracy

```
There's a CONSPIRACY.
You found EVIDENCE of its atrocities.
Now, THEY are AFTER YOU.

Bring a photograph, clipping, post-it, etc. to represent your evidence. In turns, pin your evidence to the board. Introduce yourself. Explain how you found your evidence, what frightening truth it exposes, and whether you FIGHT BACK, or RUN.

In turns, CONNECT EVIDENCE, using string to tie together pairs unconnected to each other. Explain to us how they’re connected, and how that either:
	- UNCOVERS a HIDDEN RESOURCE OR ALLY;
		-- Where is it? What, or who, is it?
	- GETS an UNCOVERED RESOURCE OR ALLY on your side;
		-- At what cost?
	- REVEALS a GOAL of THE CONSPIRACY;
 		-- Why is it horrifying?
	- Or DELAYS THEM, by sacrificing a RESOURCE, ALLY, or YOURSELF.

Whenever your evidence becomes part of any connection past its first, THE CONSPIRACY MOVES. Tell us how THEY either:
	- TAKE your evidence, and all RESOURCES and ALLIES it UNCOVERED;
	- ACHIEVE one GOAL. If none were known, one’s revealed;
	- DISPLAY their power, only if DELAYED. Now, they’re no longer DELAYED;
	- Or FIND YOU. You die, or worse.

When ALL evidence has more than one connection, your stories end. In turns, tell us how you DIED FIGHTING, or LOST EVERYTHING.

## Roommates From Hell

```
Character creation: 
Name, age, occupation, and three positive traits for your character.  Go in a circle and introduce yourselves to each other; as each roommate is introduced, write down a reason why you hate them.  Go around the circle again and read these reasons to each other, writing down what applies to your character.  Each player creates one House Rule.

House Rules: 
When you’re called out for breaking one, take a Blame Token.  When creating one, do not significantly remove another player’s agency.

Play: 
Take turns setting scenes by establishing something that’s gone wrong in the house.  Someone must be blamed for this.  Roommates may burst into the scene at any time, but must enter when mentioned.  Once all opinions have been voiced, set a minute timer; you must decide who’s to blame by its end.  Said player (or players) takes a Blame Token.  The player with the LEAST blame tokens creates a new House Rule, and the next player sets a scene.

Game end: 
Once all players have set two scenes, the player with the MOST Blame Tokens narrates the fate of the house.  Each player narrates their character’s fate.

## On Cuddling Dragons: A Primer for Beginners

```
It is a well known fact that slaying a dragon is very difficult. Cuddling one presents a whole new set of challenges! They’re spiny and thorny and tough, and they occasionally breathe fire or spit acid. Here’s a brief guide to help you through your difficult (but rewarding!) pursuit.

Step 1: Find an appropriate dragon to cuddle. (Find someone to play this larp with you)

Step 2: Go over the various parts of the dragon. Ask your dragon companion what parts of them are sharp, which parts should be avoided, etc. (The person playing the dragon should take this opportunity to tape weird, uncuddleable objects to their body. You’ll need a lot of tape. Suggestions include: Spoons. Toothpicks. Sandpaper. A tinfoil helmet. Leather work gloves. A pot on your head. Double sided tape. Boots. Etc.)

Step 3: The dragon lies on the floor curled up in a ball. You attempt to wrap yourself around the dragon. Try not to hurt yourself on the sharp bits. (The person playing the dragon should not make any attempt to be more cuddleable.)

Step 4: Bask in the knowledge that you are cuddling a dragon. (You lucky bastard.)

## Dualistic Voices

```
You’re not the master of your world. Be it salvation or damnation, your world’s fate is not only in your hands but in those next to you.

Preparation:
Minimum of 3 players.
Sheets of paper and pencil for everyone.
Each player describes 3 Humanoid races. Then describe the type of civilization they live in. Example: “Orcs living in a steampunk civilization.”
Each player describes the “Hero” from each race they’ve picked.
Who are they? Do they have any powers or specialties? What’s their personality? What do they do and what are their goals?
Each player take turns describing an event about a Hero, but no more than 5 events for each Hero. Write it down on your paper.
The player on the left will describe a tragedy or disaster about the event.
The Player on the right will describe an achievement or happiness about the event.
 The creator of the Hero combines those details and create an event.
  After the 5th turn, players will end their Hero’s story.

Optional:
Each player picks a Hero and create a story in which they go into the world of the player to their right. Create 5 events about their adventures .

## The Trust

```
Three players are Corporations. Describe their names and industries.
One player is The People. Describe their land, their culture.

Corporations commission a factory (a square of paper). Describe its product.
Roll a d20 for factory OUTPUT.
Roll a d20 for factory COST.
Output minus cost equals NET. Write these on your factory. (Net can be negative).

Players take turns. The People go last.

Each turn, Corporations can:

- Commission or close one factory
- Change a factory’s OUTPUT or COST by 1
	or
- Steal a factory by grabbing it and increasing its COST. The robbed Corporation can grab it back, increasing COST again. This continues until someone gives up. Each increase is final and immediate. 

Narrate your actions. Be proud. Be profitable.

The People can:

- Make a request of any or all Corporations (ask for change in a factory’s COST or OUTPUT, beg to close or not close a factory). Corporations address (or ignore) these requests immediately.
	or
- Take action against one Corporation (Destroy a factory, transfer a factory to another Corporation). These can’t be stopped. 

Narrate your actions. Be convincing. Be vengeful.

Add each Corporation’s NET across all factories for a score. 

Highest score after four turns becomes The People.

## Fatimah's Busy Day

```
The youngest player is Fatimah.  

Others play her anthropomorphic burqa, Amir.  

Fatimah is running errands before going on a trip.  

Using the prompts below as guidelines, play out scenes from Fatimah’s day.

[Open-Air Market], [Alleyways]

Fatimah’s world is blue-tinted, because Amir is blue, but Amir can see its true colors.  Amir, describe these to her as she travels, highlighting details that her screened saccades miss.  

[Open-Air Market], [Alleyways], [Mosque]

Fatimah’s world is dangerous, because people are desperate and violent, but Amir protects her from harm.  Amir, tell how you turn away gazes, camouflage her movements, and render her invisible to potential bad actors.  

[House], [Graveyard], [Alleyways]

Fatimah’s friends and family are in turmoil, because the world is bleak.  They are upset that she is going away.  They grasp at Fatimah.  Amir, tell Fatimah how they feel, but be mindful of her feelings, too.

Whenever Amir speaks, everyone talks all at once.  Through the noise, Fatimah chooses which narratives to silence, one by one, by saying “Hush...” and the speaker’s name.  The remaining narrative(s) become what is real.  When ready, Fatimah can silence everyone—and just exist—before ending the scene.

End play when Fatimah leaves for her trip.

## Quarantine

```
Two players, d8.

You are siblings trapped in a quarantine zone, just like everyone else in town. The military stopped bringing food ages ago. You tried rationing but there is none left. 
You have Things: mouldy potatoes, expired spam, dog treats, shoes, houseplants, your dog, cellar rats, and each other. 
Number of Things you have left is your Stamina. You have a shared pool of 8 Hope. Take turns Scavenging. 

Discuss options together. Try Scavenging or eat a Thing, then describe tonight's meal. 

To Scavenge, roll d8 against Stamina. If you rolled-under describe an act of violence you witnessed that was worse than anything you ever saw. Return empty-handed and lose 1 Hope. Otherwise roll again. You return with food, but if you rolled-over describe an inhumane act you committed to get it that was worse than anything you ever did and lose 1 Hope. Share your story later or don't. 

On the third day, the military leaves. On the sixth, your neighbour's house is raided. On the ninth you see people eating bodies. On the twelfth chaos reigns.

Starve when there's no meal. Commit suicide when there's no Hope. Survive for two weeks and be rescued.

## Magic for Sanity

```
You have made infernal pacts for spells, but casting spells reduces your humanity. To make a character, you select a number that ranges from two to twelve. You also decide upon one of the five elements as a specialty: wood, metal, fire, water, or earth. The higher the number, the stronger your magic. Whenever you cast a spell, you succeed if the result of 2d6 is less than/is your number. Whenever you want to do anything involving common sense or social interaction, you succeed if the result of 2d6 is more than/is your number. Whenever you roll a two, you increase your number by one. When your number is twelve and you roll a two, you’ve been driven insane by your eldritch revelations and must make a new character to continue playing. When you cast a spell related to your element, your number is increased by two while casting that spell.
The referee creates/maintains the world and its inhabitants, except players. It is the referee’s job to adjudicate the world’s reaction to the players. The referee obeys the following rules, in order of importance:
     -Give players choices
     -Keep players interested
     -Remain impartial
     -Propel the narrative
     -Keep secrets
```
<hr> 

## Dreamcard

```
You play a shared dream

there are 4 segments of dreams. logical, illogical, real and surreal. 
When you start a game every player writes two cards from each of this segments, this could be a word or sentence even a drawing or painting. The youngest player start with „suddenly i fall in the void where all dreams are born and...“ then he plays his first card and tells what happened. The other players can play there cards after 5 sentences the player says(he may talk more and maybe no one wants to interrupt him but he must have at least 5 sentence where no one interrupts him).
The rule for playing cards is simple, if the current  card is logical or real you only can play surreal or illogical. The game ends with the last card and the last sentence start with „and in the last moment before i lived again i...“ and ends with „and then i wake up“

## Healthcare

```
You’re doctors. Every session there’s a patient.
Doctors must read and swear to uphold the Hippocratic Oath.
Shuffle standard playing cards. Each doctor draws 12 cards, selects one, adds it to hand, and passes the rest to the left. Repeat process until doctors have 12 cards in hand.
Clubs: Intelligence, diagnoses, analysis.
Diamonds: Prestige, procedures, money.
Hearts: Humanity, talking, morality.
Spades: Chance, revelations, hope.
Value 2-14: Difficulty
    Example: Doctor talks to patient to find out more, and GM sets the difficulty as Hearts-8.
    To accomplish something, doctors draw 5 cards from hand, and use them to total the value or higher in that suit, using as few cards as possible. Discard after. When 5 cards aren’t in hand, shuffle discard into new hand.
Doctors may break the Hippocratic Oath, to automatically succeed (1/Session). After, if they:
Think it was better than failure. -Spade, +Club.
Don’t care. -Heart, + Diamond.
Can’t justify it. -Diamond, +Heart.
Believe nothing could be done. -1 Club, +1 Spade.



Doctors earn 1 experience when:
They fail.
Patients die.
They learn.
They uphold the Hippocratic Oath (1/Session).
    Doctors add one card of a chosen suit (randomly determined value) to their hand when they reach 4 experience.

## Carry On

```
Every player writes two or three encounters on note cards and places them in the center.

Pick a captain.  

The others claim an officer position (Gunnery, Crew, Navigation, Science) and one to three dice from the pool.  

The captain describes the mission, ship and an opening scene. 

The players may RP freely. 

Eventually an officer picks an encounter and describes the scene. The captain decides the course of action (who rolls) but should allow the officers to advise.  Any officer who supported the choice may contribute a +1.

Roll Results:  the rolling officer...
10+: describes the successful outcome.
7-9: picks a new encounter and describes how the scene changes.
6-: describes the failure.  Another officer must sacrifice one of their dice and describe how they fix the situation.  The captain picks if there is no volunteers.

The ship is lost if all dice are sacrificed.

Free RP resumes.

The mission ends after all officers have picked or there are no more encounters.  

The captain may praise or critique any officer he wishes in their final report.  

Dice Pool = 2xPlayers

Example Encounter: 
A privateer frigate following in our wake.
An alien artifact attaches to the ship!
Mutiny!
Distress signal!
Sabotage!
```
<hr> 

## Whip

```
Two characters, stuck in a tense argument, too stupid to just stop and make up. Consider: angry lovers, unpleasant coworkers, jealous friends, bitter siblings, etc. Spend ten minutes fleshing out their relationship and naming the big problem you’re here talking about now.

Take turns – on your turn, accuse or say something about their character that they couldn’t possibly ignore. If they wish to respond, they have to suffer actual physical pain (the form of that pain is up to the two of you: smacks, shocks, riding crops) to the player before doing so. They may then take a turn, accusing or saying something of you, and if you wish to retaliate, you must also suffer that pain. Continue until one of you refuses. Shoot for spiteful, petty, inflammatory things, and angle it so that if you would just shut up and apologize, this would all go away.

Each player may refuse once for free, abandoning that argument then starting a new related one. Once all refusals are used up and someone refuses to suffer pain, they get to say what their character does or says instead and how it impacts the relationship. It probably won’t be great.

## BoneRPG

```
You are a SKELETON, and you have been animated by your GAME MASTER to complete a mission.

You only have one SKILL, and one ITEM.

Whenever the GM deems your TASK hard enough, you must roll a D6.

In order to succeed, you need to roll a 5 or more.
When using your SKILL or ITEM, you need to a roll a 3 or more.

SKELETONS can’t die, but they can lose LIMBS. When you fail a TASK, lose a LIMB.
You can also sacrifice a LIMB before rolling to automatically succeed a TASK.

Draw your SKELETON on a piece of paper, and tear off a LIMB when you lose it in game.

## The Deep Dark

```
The Deep Dark -
The Deep Dark is a dungeon delving game for three players. It uses 2d6 for all resolution. 7+ is a success, 6- is a failure.

Each player is either a:
Cartographer - Finds ways through dungeon
Quartermaster - Keeps group supplied.
OR
Man-at-Arms - Defends group.

The group begins with 4 torches and 5 HP and may choose:
Map - +1 to one Exploration test
Torch - +1 Torch
OR
Sword - +1 to one Combat test

The game proceeds in phases, beginning with Exploration. The players are then free to move between Exploration and Camp as necessary.

Exploration tests Cartographer: 7+ finds uncharted room, 6- gets Lost.
        	-Lost: Subtract 1 Torch and Combat encounter!

Camp: Choose to Explore (move to Exploration) or Scavenge. 
Scavenging tests Quartermaster: 12 finds +1 sword or map, 7+ finds +1 Torch, 6- combat encounter!

## Zone-side Picnic

```
Inspired by the Stalker video games and Arkady and Boris Strugatsky’s book, Roadside Picnic.

Create a group text conversation with all other players.  

To play, take your phone to a park or other safe public area.  Go by yourself and avoid contact.  

If you see another person, text the group describing the encounter.  This person may be a native of the zone or another stalker hunting for artifacts.  Narrate the encounter however you wish.  

Share pictures with the group of any animals (creatures), strange debris (artifacts), structures or artwork (anomalies).  

When you are ready to leave the zone, pick up an artifact near an anomaly, preferably litter.  You may dispose of it properly at the edge of the zone.  Brag to the group about your big score.

If you spot another player in a zone, avoid, follow or confront them.  The first player to point at the other has the upper hand.  They may offer terms, take an artifact, “disarm”, “kill”, or “co-operate”.  

Disarmed players may not point at anyone till morning.

Dead players may not point at others, gather artifacts or message the group till morning.

Co-operating players may not point at the other till morning.

Get out alive!
```
<hr> 

## The world is ending

```
The world as we know it is ending. Nobody knows why, but some destruction signals like earthquakes and plagues are happenings.

Playing N persons, each player writes on paper N-1 apocalyptic disasters (e.g. plague) and a list with N+1 resources for surviving (e.g. packed food). Additionally, each player writes on paper a root cause for the end of the world (military virus, drought, etc.).

One by one, each player chooses one apocalyptic disaster on his paper and narrates it to one of the other players (trying to assign one disaster to each player along the game). Then, the chosen player must narrate how he survives the disaster using the resources in his paper. If he need an additional resource he can talk and negotiate with other player to exchange one resource by another. If the player is not able to overcome the disaster he must give one of the resources to the player that narrated the disaster.

When all the disasters have been narrated, the player with more resources (survived more times) wins and narrates how he discovers the root cause of the apocalypses (the cause he wrote) and how he stops it (or not).

## Shopkins Party

```
Grab four Shopkins for each player in the game and put them in a bag.

The youngest players draws a Shopkin from the bag. Everyone should say, “Happy Birthday!” Today is this Shopkin’s birthday party! On a sheet of paper write down her name. Place the Shopkin on the table: she’s waiting for her friends to arrive.

The player to the right draws another Shopkin from the bag. The first guest has arrived! Write her name down and flip a coin: on heads the guest is one of the birthday girl’s best friends forever; on tails she is a mean bully. Note this down. The players now act out a scene involving the party goers. If the birthday girl stands up to a bully during a scene the bully is now one of her best friends forever.

Continue to draw guests till you have drawn half your Shopkins. The next Shopkin drawn is the birthday girl’s mom. She’s got the cake. Everyone sing Happy Birthday!

Each Shopkin drawn after this point is someone’s mom. They are here to pick up their kid. Make sure they leave with a loot bag!

## Secret Hearts

```
The fey are ancient, unwavering.

The GM plays the mortal supplicants. They describe who challenges the Fey court. The supplicant secretly selects a die size each scene, representing the magnitude of their quest, and rolls it.

D2-D4-D6-D8-D10-D12-D20

2-4 Fey take a colour wheel each to show their secret heart. 
Each takes a D6, D8, and D12 and secretly assigns them a colour.

Red-Anger.
Yellow-Joy.
Blue-Sadness.
Orange–Excitement.
Green-Fear
Purple-Loathing

The Fey are capricious. Before the supplicant approaches, each Fey picks one colour/emotion.

Play out the scene. The supplicant arrives. The Fey must decide whether to grant their request while channelling their chosen emotion.

Once an outcome is decided, each Fey in turn is subject to a vote.

All participants vote the colour the Fey has represented. If a majority match the Fey’s chosen colour, that Fey may roll their dice against the supplicant. Otherwise their die is diminished, dropping to the next lowest size.

Rolling less than the mortal diminishes your die, and switches it to a complimentary colour.
Rolling greater than the mortal increases your die and switches it to the contrasting colour.

If increasing an emotion above D20, Fey are overwhelmed.

## Divine Circles: Kingdom in Decline

```
The Angels’ Patrons have lost Faith, so sayeth the Lord; In the beginning, there were two (or more). One was God. The Rest; Angels.

Angels speaketh their Domain: “I am the Angel of...”; Method: “I rule my Domain using...”; and Patron: “...is my most trusted Patron.” Assign one die to each: D4+2, D8, D12-2.

God influences Patrons, who influences Methods, which influences Domains, which influences God.

Angels roll their Patron die, then Method die. Subtract Patron from Method to determine Faith. If Faith is negative, God decrees the Patrons hinder the Domain; if positive they help the Angel.

Angels roll Domain, then narrate using Method to restore Glory to their Domain. Angels must either; Accept Faith for their roll, or Divert Faith to God or another Angel. If Faith results in the Domain roll becoming negative the Angel experiences a divine complication. An Angel receiving Diverted Faith must Accept it. Add final results to Glory.

Faith Diverted to God is summed and used to influence Patron rolls; negative Faith increases Patron rolls. Play continues starting with the Angel with the highest Glory.

If any Angel’s Glory goes negative, their Domain plunges into chaos and they fall from grace.

## FALLEN STARS

```
FALLEN STARS

2-4 players, 1 GM, deck of 52 cards

Your Empress has been killed and the Empire seized by traitors. As her Avatars, greater than mortals, you must deliver vengeance upon the Usurper. Each player selects a unique Virtue:

Glory (Clubs)
Honour (Spades)
Justice (Diamonds)
Passion (Hearts)

Each player draws six cards then discards two. Players’ cards are kept private. 

Play takes place in four phases.

During the Raid phase players will strike to gather intelligence and material. During the Retaliation phase the traitors strike back. Players then Rally their own forces and commit them to the Revenge against the Arch-Traitor.

The GM establishes a scene. Each player describes their actions, placing one card from their hand face down. The GM then draws one card face up to indicate the opposition. 

Players reveal their cards, then describe the outcomes of their actions in order of lowest value card to highest. A player with a higher card than the opposition has succeeded. A player succeeds on a tie if their card matches their Virtue. 

Begin the next phase when all actions are resolved. 

Play to discover the cost of revenge.

## Ablative Soldiers

```
The players are cybernetic shock troopers manufactured by the lowest bidder. They have access to nearly any technology available, but all of it is single-use and must be discarded from their body after use.

A storyteller provides the mission the troopers must complete. Each player tracks their body components. Challenges can be resolved by either simple d100 rolls against the storyteller's difficulty, opposed d100 rolls, or troopers can sacrifice off an appropriate body part to succeed automatically and explain what the tech does to help them. The storyteller may decide the body part must be bigger to accomplish the goal, particularly if weaponry is involved. A fingertip may not have an explosive big enough to clear a room, but a foot, or a leg, may be able to. Players cannot use the same body part twice, and must track which parts have been used as the mission goes along. Players may exchange parts with each other, or salvage them from fallen cyborgs if they come across any.

If victorious, the players get to retire to a proper, durable cyborg body. Failure means their slowly shrinking shells waste away in the mission zone.

## Ghost Estate

```
Idioms are made flesh in the reality fractured Irish village of Ballynagopaleen. 

You are spirits squatting in a ghost estate in the, otherwise typical, village. Describe yourselves, when and how you died, and what's left unfinished in your previous lives. Completing those tasks (however metaphorically) allows your spirits to pass on - your ultimate goal.

You have two pools: SPOOKY for spectral actions, & NOGGIN to interpret the modern world.
			
	Dead (years)		     SPOOKY		     NOGGIN
	===========================================
		1		        	1			           5
		10			        2			           4
		50			        3			           3
		100			        4			           2
		500+			5			           1

One action costs one point. Resolve competitions with a D6, modify rolls with points.

Points refresh by "invoking" new idioms (once per idiom). Describe how that idiom manifests and cope with it - many will turn sinister. You are permanently banished to limbo if both pools zero-out.

Idioms emerge during play or when the GM rolls on the:

	Random Idiom Encounter Table (extend / amend / localise as desired):
	======================================================
	"Celtic Tiger" - green, stripy, tooth and claw, successful attacks drain points
	"Raining cats and dogs" - plummeting pets
	"Christ on a bike" - wheelie based messianism
	"Hungry grass" -  vicious landscaping
	"Chance your arm" - roll those bones, risk your pool
	"Story horse" - distracting narrative equine

## Investigator200

```
Derivative system for horror games. 
Assumes familiarity with popular horror RPGs.

Rulings, not rules.
Say yes or roll dice.
Only players roll dice.

Stats (assign: +2, 0, -1)
Action (physical)
Insight (mental)
Influence (social)

Conditions (assign: 10, 5)
Health (HP) (+1 / day of rest)
Sanity (SP) (+1 via vignette between scenarios with Bond)

Traits
Occupation (Career. See other RPGs for lists)
Belief (Ideal, concept, moral - drives you into danger)
Bond (NPC you confide in)
Flaw (Gets you into trouble)

Core mechanic: 2d6+STAT
10+: You do it
7–9: You do it with a cost (narrative, -HP or -SP)
6-: The GM says what happens (could be a cost)

Advantage: Anything *directly* related to Occupation = treat 6- as 7-9.
Disadvantage: Treat 10+ as 7-9. Some difficult tasks impose Disadvantage.
(Dis)Advantage cancel out.

Insight: Good roleplaying (e.g. Belief, Flaw) grants Insight (max 1).
Consume Insight later for Advantage.

Harm
Damage = Light: -1(d6) SP(HP), Normal: -2(d6) SP(HP), Heavy: -3(d6) SP(HP)
0 HP = Action test to stay alive. 7-9 result = -1 Action.
0 SP = Action test to stay sane. 7-9 result = -1 Insight / Influence.

Conflicts
PvP = Attacker - defender stat & roll

Advancement
Roll boxcars (2x6’s) = +1 Stat

## Valor: The Dimming Flame

```
Valor: The Dimming Flame is an RPG about Paladins refusing temptation and darkness within themselves.

Each player is a Paladin; a devolt holy warrior. Each paladin begins the game with 7 resolve.
The GM is temptation. Giving instances of corruption and bravery to the weathered souls of the paladins.

Every challenge the GM gives a paladin tests the resolve of these knights. A test is taken by rolling 2d6. On a result of 8 or greater the paladin accomplishes a task. If either d6 rolls a 1, a resolve point is ripped away from that paladin. At zero resolve, the paladin falls from grace and into darkness, no longer able to walk the path with the rest of the paladins. 

Paladins can push their resolve, adding a third d6 to a task after a failed result at the cost of one resolve. If the third d6 rolls a 1, additional resolve is not lost. 

A paladin can possibly restore lost resolve by achieving heroic deeds or by praying. A paladin can pray once per day by rolling 1d6. On a 5 or greater one resolve is restored to the worn warrior.
```

## Our Last Summer

```
You play adolescents sneaking off on adventure.
Materials: 1 small bag of M&Ms.
Players pick a nickname and three things their character is good at.

Each player describes their preparations and the home they are leaving.
Then everyone plays out the trip and the GM introduces obstacles. 

To overcome obstacles each player describes their actions and grabs an M&M from the bag. 
RED: Failure, you get hurt.
YELLOW: Failure, you get scared.
ORANGE: Success + weather gets worse.
GREEN: Success + animals are more dangerous.
BLUE: Success + grownups are more dangerous.
If your character is good at their action you may grab two and eat one. Next obstacle you cannot use this rule.
If there are more failures than successes the GM grabs 3 M&Ms and narrates how they fail. Otherwise they overcome the obstacle.
Place all grabbed M&Ms in a pile.

After an obstacle one player can set a scene where they tell the others what sucks in their character’s life, then eat two pile M&Ms. Take turns.

If the pile ever has more than 5 of a color, play a bad ending based on the color.
If the bag is emptied play a good ending.

## Chirognomy

```
Delve into a nostalgic dreamland to revoke your biggest regret from the Tarot.

CASTING DICE

Cast some d6 equal to your the most relevant score, keeping exactly two, versus the gamesmaster's d12.  Do you succeed?
- I scored lower: NO, AND things worsen
- I scored higher: YES, BUT things complicate
- We match: YES AND the dreamland alters in your favour

STATTING YOUR SHADOWSELF

You have four scores: ambition, responsibility, creativity, communication.  Each begins at value 2.

Consult your non-dominant palm; look for the biggest gap between your fingers:
- First and second: confident, increase ambition and responsibility by 2 each.
- Second and third: responsive, increase responsibility and creativity by 2 each.
- Third and final: independent, increase creativity and communication by 2 each.
- Negligible difference: practical, increase all values by 1.

Next, decide:
- Head line: What is your biggest achievement?
- Heart line: What are you afraid of?
- Life line: To whom do you owe your life?

Finally, reduce any one of your scores by 1.

DENIZENS OF DREAMLAND

You seek the Major Arcana personality numbered as the time now according to the 24h clock.  Denizens of the dreamland roll 2d12 and take the highest; Tarot personalities roll 4d12 and take the highest.

## Lawsuits & Litigators

```
A PBTA rule making mini-game for use with other games.

Trial:
PC: make up a rule you want. Invent a story about an NPC victimized because this rule doesn’t exist. Grandstand!

 GM/DM: Expose how this person wasn’t victimized! Add to the story! Grandstand!
PC: Roll 2d6:
10+ jury finds for you! The rule lasts for 1 session pending appeal.
7-9 you lose, but preserve error and appeal.
6- you lose, failed to preserve error and cannot appeal. Also, you can no longer go to trial.

Appeal:
GM/DM and PC: One at a time, explain in sedate tones why the rule is bad(GM/DM) or good(PC). First to go gets rebuttal. Players should interrupt with obtuse questions.
PC: Roll 2d6: 
10+You win, Supreme Court (SC) denies cert. Rule is permanent.
7-9 appeal finds for you, but SC grants cert. Rule lasts 3 sessions pending cert.
6- you lose, and SC denies cert. 

Cert:
Same procedure as Appeal, but all the players add archaic rules to how you can talk.
PC rolls 2d6:
10+ SC affirms. The rule is permanent!
7-9 SC plurality. The rule has a strange limitation.
6- SC reverses. The rule goes away.

## SUPERHERO RPG

```
Players are superheroes defending a neighborhood/city/country/planet from evil and disaster.
They have 6 stats: Strength, Speed, Toughness, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
Stats are ranked either F, D, C, B, A, or S
The rankings correspond to the following dice:
F: d4
D: d6
C: d8
B: d10
A: d12
S: d20
Any time the player attempts to do something non-trivial they roll a die corresponding to the stat corresponding to the task. If the number is high enough (as determined by the GM) they succeed, if not, they fail.
A player can have up to 2 S rank stats, 3 A, and 1 B if they have no other powers.
During character creation players can design their own powers; the GM will determine how much they must lower their base stats to acquire the power.
Upon completing enough heroic actions, the GM may let the players level up, either by gaining more powers, higher ranks, or upgrading their current powers.
All things like player death, health, or complex combat will be up to the discretion and creativity of the GM. Creativity > Giant Rules Section
```

## Melody & Memories

```
Magic is real, and relies on music. When we need to act outside of our realm, we use nostalgia.

You need a pack of cards.

Note your character’s Name and Instrument. Pick a Truth:
	
	I am (SMART / STRONG / SOCIAL).

A Tunekeeper has been murdered. Decide on their name together.

Take turns answering about the Tunekeeper:
	How did you meet?
	What Melody did they teach you, and what does it do?
	What is the kindest thing they did for you?

You’ve gathered to find the person who did this. Pick one to answer each.
	What is their name?
	What do they look like?
	What Instrument do they play?
	How did they kill the Tunekeeper?
	Where are they now?

Some of these will be true, GM decides.

When you act outside your realm, draw 4 cards. Draw an extra card for each if they help: Melody, Instrument, Truth, Name. Choose 4 of your cards.
	4 RED: You have succeeded.
	3 RED: There is a consequence, but you succeed.
	ANYTHING ELSE: You fail.

If you fail, pick:
	You lose a Melody.
	You lose your Name.
	You lose your Instrument.
	You lose your Truth.

If you have none left, you die.

## The Goblin Warrens

```
A band of goblins must defend their lair against bloodthirsty adventurers.

SETUP

Each player chooses five d6s, representing their five goblins. Specialties are based on die color: Blue for brawn (strength and endurance), green for guile (cunning and alertness), and anything else for agility (speed and stealth).

TRAIT CHECKS

Trait checks involve a trait (brawn, guile or agility), and a difficulty number that players must equal or exceed.

Each player rolls 1-3 of their surviving goblin dice, using the highest roll to determine success. Failure means their lowest rolling goblin dies. One goblin also dies on a double, or two on a triple.

If the trait matches a goblin’s specialty, the player may reroll that die, keeping the new result.

COMBAT

Adventurers are represented as colored d8s, and classified as fighters (brawn), wizards (guile) or rogues (agility). Combat is a standard trait check, except an adventurer die is rolled with the goblin dice to determine the trait and difficulty (1-8). The adventurers must be fought until defeated.

ADVENTURE

An adventure has five scenes, narrated by the GM. The first four require a trait check with a random trait and difficulty. The final scene involves fighting the adventurers (one per player).

## Tyrze, a MMORPG

```
“Tyrze” is a MMORPG.  The land of Tyrze has different zones populated by different races. Human, dwarf, and elf are the common races. There are also zones for giants (cyclops, hill, stone, frost, fire, and Titan), reptile (lizardman, naga, gorgon, basilisk, drake, dragon), demi-human (goblin, orc, ogre, troll, imp, and Demon), shapeshifters (catperson, minotaur, centaur, treant, sphinx, and Doppleganger), and undead (skeleton, zombie, ghost, werewolf, vampire, and Lich). Each race has class restrictions. There is a level cap of 100. Every time your character completes 20 levels, he may continue leveling that character, or start over at level 1 in the same zone with a more powerful character. For example, if your skeleton reaches level 20, he may swap to a 1st level zombie. If your zombie reaches level 40, you may skip ghost, and go straight to 1st level werewolf. The zones are in constant battle with each other. One town in each zone is neutral and populated by NPC’s. I believe a game like this would foster community, and also allow players to become boss monsters who can try to ransack other towns. I have many details for this game if you’re interested.

## Performance Issues

```
An actor portrays a multitude of characters in their career. What if they were recruited into a mercenary team together? It’s like the Expendable where the whole team is composed of multiple Stallones, or Arnolds, or...

WHAT YOU NEED
2-3 players (GM optional)
1d6 per player

MECHANICS
Players choose 3 characters from TV or Film who were portrayed by a single actor. (Eg. Eddie Murphy: Axel Foley, Prince Akeem, Pluto Nash)
Designate each character to an even and odd number. (Eg. 1-2=Axel Foley, 3-4=Prince Akeem, 5-6=Pluto Nash).
Describe the story. Meditate actions (combat or not) with dice rolls — roll a d6 to determine if you succeed with awesome (on Evens) or fail with humor (on Odds). (Optional rule: Never tell them the Odds. Just tell them how you fail.)
You can “flip your roll” to success if you impersonate the character in their actions or use a one-liner from their respective movies or television show.
Games can be cooperative or PVP against a foe or obstacle presented by the GM or other players.

## Flirt Party Aftermath

```
Flirt Party Aftermath
a supplement to Flirt Party - 20-50 players.
by Johannes Oppermann

The Talk

Everyone, think of your most intense past relationship. When you were sure what it was. Think of the talk you had before you were sure. Describe your situation on an index card. Be brief, but clear. Put all index cards in a hat. Mix, then draw one at random. This is your motivation. 

Partner up, take opposite seats at a long table. Like speed dating, but assume you’ve already met. You’re at a point where at least one of you wants an answer to the question “What is this between us?” 

Take 5 minutes with your partner, try to achieve your goal. After that, leave your card on the table, move one space left. Opposites, keep your seat, but pass your card to the left. Repeat until you’ve tried all cards.

Ice Cream & Breakups

Same as before, write on an index card. But this time, think of the time you broke up. Think of when you knew you would. Think of when you had the talk. Write your motivation. Then have the talk, as above. 

Now have some ice cream - you’re so brave, treat yourself!

## A Nice Meal (For Once)

```
5 people are going to have a holiday dinner. Decide on your ties to each other. Everyone starts with:  0 Forks, 3 Spoons, Spoon, a random power and random goal.

Powers:
Gain 1 Spoon when they are the only person pro- or anti-skub (nonsense argument)
May spend Spoon instead of Spoons to cook
Can spend 1 Spoon end an argument with no Spoon loss or gain

Goals:
have 5 Forks, 
have 5 Spoons, 
have 5 Spoon

Cook! 
Everyone can spend Spoons to make dishes, at least 5 dishes must be made total but any person can make however few or many they want.

Eat?
Go clockwise, you may either talk (spend 1 Spoon)  or eat (gain 1 Fork the person who made the dish gains 1 Spoon).
If you talk, flip a coin, you will be either pro - skub or anti skub. In 30 seconds say why. 

Argue!
If everyone agrees everyone gains a Spoon. 
If anyone disagrees 3 minutes of talk you may spend 1 Spoon to change your opinion. If people still disagree everyone loses a Spoon. 
If anyone has a 0 in any category for 2 rounds, the game is over and everyone loses.

## Good Morning Magicland

```
Build a silly fantasy world by roleplaying the hosts and guests on TV talk shows.

Choose one player to be the host of the first show. 

As a host, introduce your show’s name and topic. Possible topics: applied magic, gossip, food, travel, politics, sports, history, conspiracy, panel, infomercial, educational.

Introduce your first guest. Announce the guest’s name and relevant info (e.g. profession, type of magical creature); then point to a player to roleplay that guest. Players should cross their arms if they don’t want to be that guest.

The host and guest then play out the show. Ham it up and revel in ridiculousness, but don’t contradict the established fiction! The host can invite another guest to join the conversation, with the initial guest staying or leaving. If another player wants to chime in, they can pretend to be on the phone and the host can “take a call from the audience”.

When the topic loses momentum, the host should thank the guest(s) and end the show; aim for five minutes. Then, another player becomes host and introduces their show. 

Players can play different characters across shows or repeat characters.

Have fun and good luck with the ratings!

## Footprints

```
There is an other place.

It is called


You get there by



Print this on paper, fill in the blanks above, then redact this sentence.
Play one game of Footprints then give this document to other people to play.

Players create a character with a name, a belief, and stats: Quick, Strong, Hale, Smart, Odd, True. Give each stat a value between -1 and 3. Stats must total less than ten.

Together, tell a story where the characters enter the other place and what happens there. Players describe their characters’ actions, the GM describes all else. Rulings will sometimes be triggered which say what happens next. They start with a bang(!)

When playing the GM adds additional rulings and/or fictional elements to this document. They add between one and five. Add pages as needed.

!When a character is hurt, reduce their Hale by one.

!When a character’s Hale is less than one, they die.

!When a character attempts something non-trivial, roll 2d6 and add whichever stat the GM says applies. If the result is more than seven they succeed. If less than ten the success is partial or comes at a cost. Otherwise the GM says what happens.

## Trapped in Deep 7

```
“Catastrophic failure detected. Implosion imminent. Evacuate station.”

You’ve almost escaped the undersea lab when… SABOTAGE! You must repair the escape pod before time runs out.

Materials: 
	1 film canister per person
	Alka-Seltzer tablets
	Water
	Eye protection
	Small jigsaw puzzle
	
Everyone chooses a role:
	Captain: Gives orders, works canisters
	Scientists: Finds pieces
	Engineers: Places pieces

Act according to your role but only as the Captain directs. Working like this, solve the puzzle to repair the pod. If there is no one left to fill a role, you can share a role (e.g. if no Captain, a Scientist can take charge).

Each canister begins half full of water. 

Put half a tablet in one canister. Snap on the lid. Turn it upside down. GO! 

If you don't get the lid on right and water spills out, STOP. You don’t close an airlock correctly and drown.

When the canister explodes, STOP. Part of Deep 7 implodes from water pressure. If the canister hits you, a bolt comes loose from water pressure, flies across the room, and kills you.

Start another canister. GO!

If all the canisters explode before you solve the puzzle, Deep 7 implodes, killing everyone.

## Everyone's The Good Guy (Of Their Own Story)

```
Storytelling RPG for 2 Players

Two players each take turns narrating a scene or event across five time periods, one forward through time, the other backwards. During each narration, the other player can interject one fact which must be incorporated into the narration. Along with that fact, all other statements should be assumed a true if not unbiased view of events.
At the beginning of the game, write down one in-narrative concession you would like the other character to make. If they do so, you win. This means that one, the other, both, or neither players could “win”.

Scenario 1: The Relationship

This scenario plays out over a five year relationship, each being one member of the relationship, from its beginning to its end. The five scenes occur at the meeting phase, the early relationship, the height of the relationship, its downward spiral, and its dissolution, each roughly one year apart.

Scenario 2: The Mission

This scenario plays out over five hours of a failed military mission, both characters being officers in charge of the mission. The scenes are the planning phase, the initial engagement, an ongoing stalemate, starting to lose, and the tragic withdrawal.

## Operation: Dragon Hunt

```
A few remaining dragons exist on U.S. National Badlands Preserve, and the National Guard is charged with keeping them from wandering onto neighboring ranches. Your team arrives for their 10 day training exercise, eager to prove themselves against the ancient beasts.

YOUR TEAM
   Teams arrive with (TEAM=2) and (EQPT=2), but stats change with each mission:
                Name:

               Dragons:

EACH DAY
    Armed with electrostatic lances,  soldiers pile into an armored Humvee and depart hoping to encounter a dragon. Their first mission is PATROL.

        --  Roll (2d6) WHITE and (2d6) RED
        --  Select any two dice and total for outcome (see chart)
        --  Describe events in a paragraph
        --  Remaining RED dice may increase stats based on mission:
                   1-3 = +0
                   4-5 = +1
                    6   = +2

## Gods among mortals

```
FROM THE RULER OF GODS TO THE GODS
“I sentence all of you to walk the earth. Far too long have you ignored the mortal realm. You will find your temples, avatars and worshipers all are forgotten or gone. 
You may try to escape your fate, alone you will not succeed. ”

TO THE GODS
Name? 
What are you god of? You may perform related actions without rolling. 
Anti-realm? You can’t perform related actions. 
Your avatar on earth? Last sighted?
Who worshiped you?
What do you look like? Then? Now?
Start: Mundane = 9, Godly = 50. 

When rolling: use a D100. 
If result under stat: Success. 
0-9: Triumph. 
90-99: Despair.

When performing non-trivial tasks fit for a mortal: roll Mundane. 
If fail: gain 1 Mundane.

When using your powers discreetly, indistinguishable from luck or tricks: roll Godly.

When performing a miracle: burn 10 Godly.

When Godly = 0: lose immortality.

When among worshipers: choose if rolls are against Mundane or Godly.

When a worshiper makes a major sacrifice in your name: gain 1D10 Godly.

When finding your avatar: Ascend.

TO THE RULER OF GODS
Challenge them, hide their avatars. 
Give them worshipers, take them away.
Give them hope, let the world be shaped.

## Birthday equilibrium

```
You all work in the same office. Go in order and introduce yourself. What kind of employee are you? Hardworking? Awkward? Unreliable?

The next person decides your position in the company - CEO, janitor or anything in between.

Oddly enough, you all have birthdays in the next few weeks. You can ask for one of the following:

1. Chocolate ($10)
2. Book ($30)
3. Whiskey ($60)
4. Game ($100)

Whichever you choose, you get $5 less (spent on wrapping paper) to invest on gifts for others.

Discuss gift ideas among yourselves. Plan carefully as there won’t be enough money for everyone. Luckily, you can take a vacation and skip one party.

Secretly write down your desired gift, whose party you’ll skip, and how will you divide your budget on others.

Celebrate birthdays in order. If you got the present you wanted - you get victory points (1 for a chocolate and up to 4 for a game). If attendants failed to raise enough money - each attendant loses 1 victory point. The winner is the person with the most points.

But.

If nobody comes to your birthday party - they’re all horrible people and they lose. You win but it’s a bitter victory.
```
<hr> 

## Situations & Explanations

```
Each player has a Player deck of 20 cards. They write one word on each. Each must: be a noun or verb, cannot be something overly ambiguous, and none can be synonyms or duplicates.

Each Player must also create 5-10 of each of the following: a Setting (a one word place like Dungeon, City), an Encounter (one adjective and noun; like Spiked Pit, Upset In-Law) and a Modifier that prevents certain cards from working (an adjective with explanation such as Angry (no Social cards), Disarmed (no items)). These are set into a pile for each that all players put theirs into.

Players shuffle their Player deck and draw 4 cards. Determine a Scene with one card from the Setting, Encounter, and Modifier decks. Each Player uses cards and explains how they’re used to get them through the Scene. Players can use their own cards to help others, and Players unable to pass a Scene are left behind. Used cards disappear. After a Scene is over, Players draw until they are up to 4 cards, and a new Scene is started.

Play continues until either there are no more Scenes (Victory!), or the players can do nothing more (Defeat).

## He say you Blade Runner

```
Humanity scores are secret. Don’t cheat.

Randomly pick one (must have at least one Runner):

-----------------------------------------------
 Character          | Humanity |  Special      
-----------------------------------------------
 Femme Fatale       |    10    |  Charm        
 Deranged Genius    |     8    |  Distract     
 Blade Runner       |     6    |  Interrogate
 Corporate Overlord |     4    |  Bribe        
-----------------------------------------------

Roll 1d12: If 10+, Replicant [-2 Humanity]
           If 12, tell everyone

Answer why you:
      seek a new life off-world?
      help <player>?
      hinder <player>?
      dress that way?
      are at the ramen stand?

Runners hunt replicants. Everyone interferes with each other.

All descriptions shall include grit, (retro)future, or noir.

Opposed actions: all involved players roll (1d12 - Humanity), high score wins. Highest Humanity breaks ties.

If your Humanity score exceeds 12, you achieve your new life off-world.


Special actions affect your Humanity score.
(roll 1d12, under Humanity)

* Charm

-1 to use. Make someone take your place.
+2 if they succeed there.


* Distract 

Help someone escape interrogation, +1.
-1 if you could, but don’t.
Failed roll: take their place.


* Interrogate - Only opponent rolls (to avoid)

Pose a philosophical conundrum.
Capture & reveal replicant status. 
If “human”, roll 1d12, on 10+ actually they’re a replicant!
Capture replicant: +4, human: -2.


* Bribe - Only opponent rolls (to avoid)

Change opponent’s action, +2.
Opponent -2.

## Group troop

```
The game starts with every player writing down a social group on a piece of paper. This can be anything, from "tango dancers" to "people who like white chocolate". Everyone picks a group note at random, and the game begins. From there everyone takes turns, starting with the oldest player present, stating a cliche or a trait they imagine people in their group share. So, if you've got tango dancers you might say "muscular calves", at which point anyone with a group who shares this trait repeats it, in this case that group might be football players. The game ends when each group has been identified and each group has matched traits with at least two other groups.

## Thomas Crown Affair RPG

```
Three Players: GM, Thief, Investigator. For Thief & Investigator their only equal is the other. Game is a diceless series of scenes.
1) GM & Thief: Play complex robbery – 4+ steps & distraction. (Investigator player not present)
2) GM & Investigator: NPC Cops mis-analyze crime to tell Investigator what didn’t happen. Investigator discerns what actually happened. 
3) All: Thief makes a mistake, becomes suspect. First meeting between Thief & Investigator. 
4) GM & Thief: Design base, where & how stolen items hidden. (Investigator player not present)
5) GM & Thief: NPC Cops enter Thief’s base; their failure probes defenses.
6) GM & Investigator: Play entering Thief’s base; Complex entry – 4+ steps & distraction. Diceless outcome ranges from total failure to total victory, likely partial victory. 
7) All: If partial victory, Thief even stronger suspect. Second meeting between Thief & Investigator. 
8) All: Cat and Mouse Relationship scenes. Is there a mutually beneficial resolution? (If interest or time, repeat 4-7 with second base)
9) All: Play complex (4 parts + distraction) second robbery with Investigator working against Thief during robbery. Thief gives GM 3 advance notes to make what Thief appears to be doing not what’s really happening. 
Who wins?

## Go Home, Young Superhero

```
2-3 players

One person plays a young superhero dealing supervillainy but also regular life. Give that player a deck of shuffled cards.

Other players GM our superhero’s dual life. Give them 2 black d6 (superhero adventures) and 2 red d6 (regular life).

Together, figure out who your young superhero is: name, alias, powers, friends, family, school, work, supervillains. Decide which supervillains are running amok and what trouble your hero is dealing with in regular life.

Hero starts with 6 cards. Other players start with one die at 3 (Tension), one at 6 (Countdown).

Each turn: 
Hero decides whether to deal with supervillainy or regular life troubles; draw card.

Increase Tension for situation not chosen. Reduce Countdown for chosen situation.

Responsible player GMs a scene about chosen situation. When outcome uncertainty arises, the hero plays cards to match or beat the current Countdown+Tension for success. Roleplay challenge result.

Cards that don’t match situation color are half value. Roleplay how hero uses real life skills to deal with supervillainy or superpowers real life.

Success= reduce that situation’s Tension.
Failure= Tension doesn’t change; draw 1 card.

A situation resolves if Tension is reduced to zero.

Game ends when a Countdown hits zero.

## DOGQUEST 1000

```
You are all dogs!
What kind of dog are you? 

>A GOOD DOG, with virtuous skills like public defending!
>A BAD DOG, with wicked skills like tax fraud!
>A PUPPER, with doggish skills like gamboling!

After deciding, describe yourselves in a few sentences.

What's the world like?  The world may be very different from our own, but dogs are a constant.

Tell us about your owner(s)!
They seem pretty swell! Each of you should say something about them! Write that all down.

Uh oh! Something's happened to them!
Decide as a group what misfortune awaits.

Got all that? It's time for an adventure!

***
Choose a player: they're the Troublemaker. They get to make trouble for the other puppies to solve! Once they solve or fail it, the player to their left becomes the new Troublemaker, and the old one resumes playing their dog! After everyone's made trouble at least once, a majority can vote to move to the Final Trouble.  As a group, choose a final Troublemaker to pose the last trouble between you and your owner(s)!

Win or lose, each player then describes a puppy epilogue! Going out for treats after is encouraged. 
```
<hr> 

## My Alibi

```
A crime has been committed. You are the primary suspect.

Who are you? What do you do? Where were you on the night of the crime?

Choose among the group who plays the dead man. The dead man writes in a piece of paper how he was murdered and incorporate items that serve as evidence to the crime equal to the number of suspects plus one. He keeps this safe. He then individually write each evidence item on blank cards, shuffles and deals three cards per suspect. 

Interrogation starts. Each suspect is given sufficient time to state alibis incorporating the three item cards. After all suspects are done, the group ranks each other’s alibi from strongest to weakest. 

The dead man then reveals the circumstances of his death, preceded by “This is how you killed me…”. Whoever has the murder weapon is the killer. If not voted as having the strongest alibi, he can alter his statement. The group decides his guilt. If he is not guilty or was voted to have the strongest alibi, the suspect with the weakest alibi is convicted for the crime. Whoever is convicted plays the role of the dead man on the next game.
```
<hr> 

## To Alex!

```
For 3-6 players, over drinks.

You just attended your complicated friend Alex’s funeral and are now drinking and telling Alex stories. 

Make three types of notecards with the following written on them:

Prompts:
-Almost arrested
-The big fight
-Best party ever  
-Childhood memory
-Getting lost
-Helping someone 

Inspiration:
-Favorite color
-Sad song
-Funny movie 
-Your shared place
-Comfy t-shirt
-Funny selfie

Complications:
-You know a secret
-You saw another side
-You have more information
-You saw the fallout
-Alex confessed something 
-You and Alex talked about it

You may add to these lists.

Each player draws 1 card of each type. On their turn, they use the “Prompt” and “Inspiration” cards to improvise a story about Alex. Other players may interject with questions, color, or comments. Players may play their complication card during another player’s turn to add a new dimension to the story.

After everyone’s turn, each player selects one of these prompts to conclude their reminiscing:
I’ll miss Alex because…
I loved Alex because…
I’m glad Alex...
I’ll never forgive Alex for…
I couldn’t understand why Alex…
I wish I would have told Alex...

The game ends with all players raising their glasses and toasting “to Alex!” 

```
<hr> 

## The Town of M

```
Divide one bag of plain M&Ms into piles by color.

Give each player one color of M&Ms.

 
The player with the most M&Ms is the leader of the town.

The other players represent the diverse society of the town. Each player should describe three things that define their group.

 
The leader will divide their M&Ms into roughly three even piles representing Laws, Expectations, and Social Norms. The leader will take one M&M from any pile and make a declaration about the town that specifically oppresses one group of people.

The people can work together and fight back by “rolling” their M&M’s. Players may throw as many M&Ms they want on the table, any that land with the “M” face up are counted as a success. All rolled M&Ms are eaten.

If the players get enough successes they describe how they changed or subverted the declaration. Otherwise, the Leader’s declaration stands.

 
Successes needed

Laws:  One Success
Expectations: Two Successes
Social Norms: Three Successes

 
Repeat this process until the Leader has no remaining M&Ms then discuss as a group how your town would function with the society that was established.

## Show and Hell

```
A sunny Monday morning finds students beaming with excitement as they wait to share childhood treasures.  This morning's show and tell, though, is a bit off.  Unsettling photos, strange artifacts, and items best left in a police evidence locker wait to be displayed.

One player serves as the teacher, who opens a photo from a random image site at the beginning of each player's turn.  The player then launches into an excited discussion inspired by the photo she has received, going on and on with all of the wondrous excitement of a first grader as her macabre tale unfolds.

The teacher and the other students get to ask questions about the object.  Does the teacher try to glean the shocking truth about the object or desperately try to find some way to shift?  Are the other students overly enthusiastic and curious, or do their innocent questions show that they are just on the cusp of understanding the full horror of the object?

The game goes on until all of the students have had a turn sharing with the class.

## Harder, Better, Faster

```
Requires :


3 to 6 Players. One Player acts as the Mediator, responsible for handling the story flow and choice consequences.
1 die.
 


Your team is special. Everything others do, you do it a little better, and usually don’t fail.

Every time a Character does something important, choose 2 out of the 3 Values (normal Characters choose only 1):

 
      Harder: Every action has a cost. If you choose this, the cost is acceptable. If you don’t, sacrifices are needed.

      Better: The quality of your work. If you choose this, it’s top-notch.  If you don’t, it will create problems.

      Faster: How long it takes to finish it. If you choose this, it happens as fast as possible. If you don’t, it takes a lot longer (the whole scene, battle, session).
 

 
The Specialization Rule: You are really good at something, and at this you get all 3 Values. On the downside, you are bad at something, and at this you can choose only 1.
 
The d6 Rule: At really special moments, roll the d6. If it’s a 6, take an extra Value. If 1, take one less. Zero Values means you completely failed. Four means an extraordinary success.

## When the Fire Dies

```
The cataclysm is over and the world has ended. We alone survive, huddled around this last fire, waiting for it to die.

While the fire lingers, we remember the world that was and the deeds done in those last days. To some they bring warmth, to others, sorrow. Come, let us speak before the fire dies.

You will need: a candle, 10 matches, tokens, and a dark room. Define the cataclysm. Create archetypal characters: noble, warrior, priest, etc. Choose a first player. 

To begin, light the candle. The first player tells a brief story of the world before or during the cataclysm. When finished, the player takes a match, lights and extinguishes it, and hands it to another player who places the burnt match before them. It is now their turn to speak. Everyone must have a burnt match before them before taking a second turn.  

For each story, if a player is moved or inspired by another's story, they may give the storyteller a token.

When all matches have been burned, count the tokens, rolling a die for ties. The player with the most tokens concludes the story and blows out the candle.

And the fire dies.

## Russian Roulette

```
You sit in a dimly lit room of the Russian mafia. There's a gun on the table pointed straight at you, you've messed up and now you gotta explain your way out of the mess from your crazy boss who has decided to play a game of Russian roulette to get answers from you.

Actions:
Pull - draw card. Narrate a scene.
Pass (start with 1) - Point your finger at another player, say why the scene involves them. It's their turn. You can't pass a pass.

## A Small World

```
You will need a GM, some additional players, 2D6, pen and paper.

You live in a big jar, a gargantuan closed jar terrarium. Nothing comes in, nothing goes out. Recently plants and smaller animals started getting sick and dying, you don’t know why. 

Describe your jar:
Many or few villages?
Wet or dry?
Hot or cold?
How long to travel to the center or to the edge?
What can be seen of the outside?

All characters choose an ability, can be used once a day:
* Heal the sick
* Tell the future using signs from the outside
* Make someone temporary change opinion
* Perform an act of great strength
* Make someone confide in you
* Mend something broken

Describe your characters:
Name? 
What makes you special? 
Who depends on you? 
What have you lost so far?

When trying to perform at non-trivial but possible task, roll 2D6
1-6: Failure (lose 1 life force)
7-9: Success with complications
10-12: Success.

Your world, the jar, starts with 24 out of 50 life force. 
Every night 1 life force is lost. 
When major destruction and death happens, 1 life force is lost.
Every time a major restoration and healing happens, 1 life force is restored.

## The Wake

```
Objective:
Honor the memory of the friend you lost.

Requirements:
• Three or more people
• Notecards
• An urn — a fireproof vessel
• Matches

Directions:
If the weather permits, go somewhere nice. If not, go elsewhere. Seek quiet. Stay close.

                           Sit in

                      a circle around

                          the urn.

Each person takes three cards and writes a number on the back of each:
                     1,
                             2,
                                     3.

Using no more than four words per card, each person answers the following:

On the first card,
       recount a treasured memory with a friend.

On the second card,
       describe a time you felt alone.

On the third card,
	     share your source of hope in the face of adversity.

Shuffle all cards into three stacks by number. Each person takes one card from each stack, making sure not to draw their own.

Each person studies their first card. When ready, they share that memory with the group as though it was their own before tearing the card up and dropping it into the urn.

Once each person has spoken, repeat for second and third cards.

                  When the time is right,

                      burn the cards

                     and seal the urn.

## The Futility of Unrequited Sentiments

```
An Romantic Paper Game for 3 players.

Sit in a triangle. Name your character.

Look at each other. You must look at someone not looking at you. When you are being looked at you must look away from the person looking at you. 

If you catch another's eyes, and it feels significant, you must stare into each other's eyes until you both feel uncomfortable. Feeling your feelings. After this you both declare out loud, at the same time, what your relationship is. Use the following list:

1. Exes
2. Dislike
3. Casual friend
4. Unspoken love for the other
5. Best friend
6. In a romantic relationship

Play continues until everyone agrees on their relationships with each other. You then discuss how you feel about each other. The discussion should be related to your current and past relationships with each other. Ask questions like:

What went wrong?
Do you still dislike me?
Are we closer now?
Will you be honest with me about how you feel?
What do you want from our relationship now?

Afterward everyone walks away without looking at each other, or speaking, for 5 minutes. Feeling your feelings. The game is over, do something light. Eat chips.

## Dispossessions

```
A team of ghost-hunters cleanse a possessed item to dispel evil from a home. 

Setup: 

This must be played at night. One player (Researcher) goes to a room with an internet-connected computer. The other players (Investigators) go to far-away room and turn-off all lights. They are only allowed a single source of light (flashlight or cell-phone). Players can only communicate across rooms by walkie-talkie or phone.

Play: 
The Investigators search for an item in the room that could be possessed. They describe it to the Researcher, who looks on the internet to find “its history.” This involves searching until they locate a spooky story about a comparable item (Ebay is useful). While waiting, the Investigators should describe bad vibes and minor supernatural occurrences happening.

If the Researcher cannot find something appropriate, they tell the Investigators that the chosen item is “clean” and they must choose another!

Once the Researcher locates and communicates a history, they click on a random Wikihow article and explain how to perform a cleansing ritual based on it. The Investigators conduct it and describe things escalating further (throwing themselves around, responding to unheard voices, etc.). 

End:
The Researcher runs to the room and observes the aftermath.

## The Great Work

```
Ours is a world of shadows. There are sparks of heavenly fire, but they are mired in mortal clay. We are diminished, robbed of our true potential. 

But in some there is a fire, not a spark. Bright enough to banish shadows. Bright enough, even, to turn lead into gold...

How to Play
You will need a Tarot deck, and 3-5 friends.

Each player creates an Alchemist.
-Choose their name and title.
-Choose a Major Arcana to represent them. 
-Choose their Great Work (maybe immortality, transcendence, life-creation). Match it to a Suit, then declare a Major Arcana that will mark its completion. 

To play, go around the table in rounds. Starting with the oldest player, go around the table drawing from the Tarot deck and describing your progress as below:
-Minor Arcana from your Suit: your work advances. Describe how you advance towards your goal.
-Minor Arcana from another Suit: you are sidetracked. Describe the useless wonder you create.
-Major Arcana:  your power grows. Describe how, and from now on draw two cards.
If you draw the Major Arcana you declared, you achieve your miracle. Describe the change it makes in the world of clay, then the game ends.

## Cats Herding Humans

```
In Cats Herding Humans, humans are playthings, companions, and caretakers. Mostly playthings.  Frustratingly, they are sometimes needed for opening things and vanquishing enemies.

Ma Wirth’s Boarding House and Cat Sanctuary is a hub of activity. Cats and humans are constantly taken in and adopted out (or whatever happens to humans). Sometimes, when humans leave, cats leave with them. Other cats stay and serve the House Cat Council.

Cats have six skills: Adorableness, Caterwauling, Mauling, Parkour, Sneaking, and Tracking (covers scent marking). Each skill uses a die. Starting skills use d20. As skills improve, they move through d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4 (best). When making an action, choose an appropriate skill and roll the corresponding die. The closer to the die’s middle numbers, the more successful the action. When making actions using multiple skills (Such as Adorableness and Caterwauling to beg), check for each skill individually when determining results. Remember, cats don’t fail so much as change their minds.

Starting cats select 5 skill improvements. Improve 1 skill after each successful game.

Possible plot hooks for the GM:
Drive off the obnoxious human
Refill the food
Find a fabled toy
Stop the invasion from beyond time
Breach the attic

## Mystery Mansion of the Mad Wizard

```
Villains have invaded the mansion! Defeat them, and grab some loot!

## Enna's friend or foe?

```
Enna is a bloodthirsty Elf ranger obsessed with beheading Orcs to collect their heads. She travels the kingdom seeking their lairs. Her 4 friends decide to join together to prevent her massacre.

The kingdom is drawn on a grid sheet. Enna and the other players start at opposite corners. All five players have four skills:  Deception, Trust, Love, Compassion. Players allocate their powers randomly to their 1d4 dice. They roll 1d6 to travel across the map (1-1 square, 2- 2 square movement, etc.). The friends’ goal is to converge where Enna is to convince her to stop. Enna’s goal is to have them joining her in her killing spree. 

When a friend encounters Enna, the friend rolls the 1d4 die to determine which skill to use, followed by a roll of 1d6 to get a score. Enna does the same. The friend wins a round if their score is higher than Enna’s. If not, Enna wins.

If Enna wins the round, the friend joins her against the other players. Enna wins the game when all have joined her party but Enna’s party wins automatically when they kill 10 orcs. The friends win when all have joined their party.

## Dust Trails

```
You and your pack roam the Wasteland on scrap-made vehicles, hunting other junk-pirates like you. 


Describe your badass vehicle and its role in the team
Choose its SPECS assigning 9 points between SPEED, WEAPONS and ARMOR. Min is 0, Max is 5.
Name your pilot.


Rules:

The GM narrates what is happening in the Wasteland: every time one of your SPECS is important to narration (i.e. maneuvering, shooting, avoiding damage), roll 1d6. 

If the result is equal or minor of your value, you succeed. If it’s higher, reduce the SPEC by one. 

If a SPEC ever goes below 0, you die in the Wasteland.  
Create a new character, it will join play as soon as the others hit TOWN.

You will find SCRAP by destroying enemy vehicles, the Gm will tell you how many KGs. 
Divide it equally among the team.

When you and your pack hit TOWN, you can use your SCRAP to upgrade you vehicle, 10kgs for 1 point of SPEED, WEAPONS or ARMOR.
 
If you reach 5 in all three SPECS, you have become a Wasteland Legend: give your character to the GM, it will become an important NPC in the story. Create a new character.

## Great Wallopers

```
The prairie dogs are attacking in force, how many points can you rack up before getting overrun! This game has two win conditions; Be the last one standing, or first to 10 points. Every round the prairie dogs attack in a force the size of the round, 1 at round one and 20 on round 20. Every round the players roll 1d20, as long as the players roll is greater than or equal to the prairie dogs they gain a point, otherwise they lose half of their points rounded up, hit 0 points and you lose. Players can exchange points to gain a permanent additional die of that size, 4 points for 1d4, you can reduce to 0 points this way without losing. If you roll a 20 on the d20 you gain an additional point.

## PROTAGONIST

```
Find 2 friends to play with. 
Pick a role each. 
The PROTAGONIST says who they are and what their goal is. 
Play to find out what happens. 

The game is narrated out of the perspective of the PROTAGONIST. They describe themselves, the scene and what is in it, but each description must be followed by a question, answered by the BEAST or GUARDIAN. 
    If both have an answer - failure fulfills the BEAST’s answer and success fulfills the GUARDIAN’s. 

When the PROTAGONIST has 0 remaining dice, switch roles to one you’ve not yet played this session. The game ends when the last PROTAGONIST has 0 dice or reached The GOAL.

GUARDIAN or BEAST cannot both use their powers on the same roll.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PROTAGONIST
Pick up 3d6, each representing traits or items.
Name/Describe these.
Discard after using. 
Roll to overcome adversity. 1-3 = failure. 4-6 = success!
Each new player does this, establishing new facts about the same PROTAGONIST.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GUARDIAN - a force for good
Add 1d4 to the PROTAGONIST’s roll (Once / Scene)
Introduce advantage (add 1d6 to PROTAGONIST’s pool) (Once / Scene)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The BEAST - a force for evil
Deduct 1d4 from PROTAGONIST’s roll (Once / Scene)
Force PROTAGONIST to roll against adversity

## Home Sweet Home

```
Welcome to the post apocalypse. You are six years old, like everyone you have ever known.

Begin by writing your name and answering questions. Each players asks another one question about their character/views. Questions like:

How many heads does your favourite animal have?
What do you think those metal things with four wheels are?
Where did you get that beeping metal bracelet?
Why are you see-through?

Each player than writes three goals:
-one personal
-one involving another character
-one about the world

Assign 1d4, 1d6, and 1d8 among them. Use the associated die when your goal is your motivation. You may also do the same to loan a die to help on a friend's roll. Roll above the difficulty to succeed.

Begin the game by revealing cards from a deck equal to the number of players. Arrange these in a grid. The group starts at the centre and begins exploration, taking turns to describe the scene associated with a card.

Clubs - Structure
Spades - Insentient
Diamonds - Phenomena
Hearts - Sentient

Number on the card = Difficulty of the task
Odd - something familiar 
Even - something strange 

Keep adding new cards as you explore further. The game ends once both jokers are revealed.
```

## Eight Facets of the City

```
Play this game on a shuffled deck of playing cards including jokers (54 cards total), using a pen.

For eight rounds, separate out a pile of seven cards (face down). The symbols for each round are circle, triangle, X, square, spiral, star, ?, and |||.  

1) Deal (from the pile) one card portrait-style write a name and/or title on the top edge and a further detail on the bottom edge.

2) Deal one card landscape and one card portrait (to the right, in a line). On the second portrait card, if it is unnamed, write a name and/or title and a detail.

3) Then on the landscape card write a place found in the city on the top and a further detail on the bottom. This should relate to the people in the two portrait cards.

4) Collect the left portrait card and put it on the bottom of the pile, then do the same with the landscape.

5) Repeat from (2), until you get a named landscape.

6) Then draw the symbol prominently on each of the seven cards.

Advice: Use associations, but don't force them. Try to let yourself discover what each symbol represents in your city.

Brilliant night sky; stars twinkling; systems bustling; cultures clashing; peoples expanding, exploring.

A thousand thousand worlds; a thousand jungles; a thousand seas. Life everywhere.
Ah, the inspiration!

Where are we? The largest menagerie in the galaxy, of course! So many creatures! From so far, so wide!
Ah, the inspiration!

Why are we here? For the sampling. For new ideas. 
To get the creative juices flowing!
Ah, the inspiration!

What creature did you find? Where is it from? 
How is it beautiful? What can it do? How is it dangerous!? 
Oh!

Find another creature. Hmm, one more for good measure. How are they amazing? 
Now splice!

Don’t you just love Skellik’s work, black bioengineer extraordinaire that he is?

Where will you wear it? What will you do there? 
For work? For pleasure? Maybe both?
What kind of dastardly deeds might you be up to today?
Hmm, yes!

What quirks have you discovered? What eccentricities have you enjoyed? Tastes, smells; impulses, instincts. 
Have they caused you trouble, or just more fun?

## NO TIME: A GAME ABOUT FAILURE

```
Destroy the evidence before the police arrive, disarm the bomb before it explodes, refuel the plane before the zombies overwhelm you.

Each character has a name, an aptitude, and a Job to do. Each Job consists of 20 points of tasks, assigned by the GM. The points in a task represent how difficult it is (Easy: 5, Taxing: 10, Hard: 15). Players have 4 d6s, each representing one action, to be distributed between tasks as the player chooses. To complete a task, players must match or exceed the difficulty of the task on their roll. The GM defines the Job.
Modifiers: +1 to a 1d6 if the aptitude is applicable to the task. +1 to a 1d6 if a PC dies during one action.
Example aptitudes: First Aid, Demolitions, Interrogation.


Failed outcomes of a task are narrated by the player, successful outcomes are narrated by the GM. Task difficulty and task importance are not related. Easy tasks might be crucial, hard tasks might be pointless. The players must determine this for themselves. Teamwork might be crucial or pointless. This game is not intended to be easy or fair.

The GM and the players narrate the outcome of the job together.

## Measured in Cups

```
Players: 2
Equipment: Gongfu tea brewing equipment.  Instructions are available here:  https://white2tea.com/2014/05/27/how-to-brew-puer-tea-three-basic-household-items/

In this game you play two people moving through the entirety of a friendship (NOT romance). The feel is modern slice of life.  

Prepare the tea for steeping.  As you do this, decide:

Where do you first meet?
What draws you to the other person?
What are your mutual interests?

Begin :

Steep the tea.  The player who pours the tea starts the conversation, set during your character's first meeting.

You can only speak after taking a sip.  When speaking, you can say one sentence of dialogue and one of description.  Take turns sipping and speaking.

When the tea leaves open fully, end this scene.

Middle:

Pause drinking.  Decide what you are doing together, around your shared interest, that you both have wanted to do for a long time.

This scene is the apex of your friendship.  Continue play as before.  End when the tea starts to taste hollow.

End:

Pause drinking.  Decide together what caused your friendship to fade.

This is one of the last times you will see each other.  Continue play as before.  End when the tea has completely faded.

## Fill in the Blank RPG

```
Players begin with 5 each of the following cards: Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs.

To attempt something the player rolls 1d10, success on 7+. To roll more dice, the player plays up to one of each kind of card. If the card is blank, write one word on the card. Words cannot be repeated. Players describe their action in one sentence using those words. The description must make sense to count; you can’t “sneak loudly”. This is at the GM’s discretion.

Facing an orc? Write “HUG” on a verb card and state “I HUG the orc,” to roll +1d10. Write “aggressively” on an adverb card and state “I AGGRESSIVELY HUG the orc,” to roll +2d10. Words can’t be erased, but cards can be used again. A player without blank cards cannot create new cards.

If a player gets hurt, they must destroy one of their cards.

The GM must create cards to roll more than 1d10. The GM must create one of each type of card before repeating any type. After the roll they put the cards in a pile. Players can destroy one of their written cards to take the top card or a random card from the pile.

## End of Days // Hidden Terrors

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The world has ended. Your job? Survive and conquer.

Each player needs: one deck of cards, three tokens.

Cards represent actions: 
Spades – Mental
Hearts – Social
Clubs – Physical
Diamonds - Player's choice. Magic? Weapons? Cash?

Conflicts are CAPITALISED: Play a card, describe an action, your opponent reciprocates. Highest card wins CONFLICT. Aces High, Jokers Wild. Suits don't have to match, but actions must make sense.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Youngest player = Survivor. 
Player to their left = Narrator.
Remaining players = Terrors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Draw 6 cards. Play one face-down.

Survivor introduces their Character and objective. Narrator introduces scene.

Narrators HINDERS Survivor five times. Narrate each Hindrance/Outcome. 

Won the most Conflicts? Take one token from the other player.

Terrors only ATTACK when Survivors play card with same suit as Terror’s face-down card. Describe your Terror, then ATTACK. Won the Conflict? Take two tokens from the other player.

Rounds end when all Survivor's cards are used, or after Terror’s ATTACK. Roles rotate clockwise. Discard hand, redraw 6, play one face-down. 

No tokens? You cannot be a Survivor until you win some back. Narrate your deaths/escapes. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got the most tokens after 7 Rounds? You win! Conclude all stories. 

Who Survived? Died? Remained Terrors?

It’s in your hands…

## Sharing Our Past

```
Gather a few friends, each person will need something to write with and something to write on. 

Everyone will take two minutes to develop a character in their head. Write parts of their backstory on the paper if needed. Ask yourself questions about them, like where they came from, what their life was like, and what they believed in. 

Once the two minutes is up, choose someone to start. When it is your turn, talk to the group about your character, going into their backstory, culture, religion, feats, or anything else you wish to share. During this time, choose three traits of your character, two positive and one negative, that came from their experiences. Then elaborate about each trait, explaining how it connects to your character’s past. After your turn, record your character’s traits on your piece of paper.

When everyone has gone, start again, and pick someone else’s trait that you’d like to hear more about, and ask a question about it. After they respond, add that trait to your character’s list. Repeat this step if the group wishes.

When the final round ends, release your characters back into their lands, now armed with knowledge of another’s life.

## Maslovmania

```
Maslovmania recommends 3+ players and a gm
gm decides setting (space, fantasy, etc)
Each player has a pyramid of needs. When a player has fulfilled all their needs, they win and the game ends. If a need is unfulfilled, all needs above it are instantly unfulfilled and cannot be fulfilled until that row of needs is complete.

Top
[Self-Actualisation]
[Prestige]	
[Intimacy]	[Accomplishment]
[Security]	[Health]	[Friends]	
[Food]		[Water]		[Warmth]	[Rest]
Bottom

Players takes turns, going clockwise. Each turn the player makes two actions from the following:
1. Choose someone to get a need of their choice, get two needs of your choice at the start of your next turn
2. Take away someone's need of your choice, get two needs of their choice taken from you at the start of your next turn
3. Exchange needs with another player
4. Take away an action of someone else on there next turn

Actions are made in secret and shared with the gm. At the end of a turn, the players play out a scene that explains how any needs affected were changed. If the gm feels their explanation is insufficient, the change is negated.

## Murder is Simple

```
A game about gumshoes, trying to solve a case in a city where everyone lies.

The GM prepares a mystery, writes its solution down and places a deck of cards on top of it. When all the cards are dealt, the truth comes to light.

The Players introduce themselves. They have three stats,  each of them starting at 0: Pain, Vice and Heat.

The GM sets a scene, then deals two card to the player leading the scene. Their sum is the target number the player has to roll over with a d20 +3 for each other participating player. If they fail, the GM can shuffle one of the dealt cards back in the deck. Then a new scene starts.

Every move below must be matched narratively.

The player may damage their stats to gain +1d6 to their roll per damage. 

They may also escalate a scene: they take 1 damage and they are dealt an additional card.

Face cards are Respites. They are instantly discarded and the player can heal 1 damage.

The stats cap at 4 damage. When all the player’s stats are capped, they bust and drop off the case. If all players bust, the story ends.

## Rise - Hack - Fall

```
One player is The Corporation, the rest are Hackers.  Do not let The Corporation see your stats.
Hackers secretly choose a Hack stat (1-10) and a Username.
Divide 30 Resources between all Hackers.
All discussion happens together. The Corporation listens and remembers.

Every mission, The Corporation has valuable data (choose 1-5). The Hackers decide which Hackers to send.  Roll 1d10 per point of value the data has.  These rolled values are the types of ICE protecting this server.  The Corporation explains their functions and digital appearance.
To melt ICE, Hackers may temporarily modify their Hack stat by secretly spending 1 Resource per point of change,  stating this new value, and removing 1 ICE matching that number.  Describe the process and destruction.  
If all ICE is melted, the Hackers divide Resources worth the data's value x3.  If ICE remains and no Hacker will melt it, the mission fails;  The Hackers get nothing.

After a mission, The Corporation may trace one Hacker by guessing their unmodified Hack stat.  If they succeed, they back-trace the Hacker to their rig and 'retire' them.  Explain your methods.  If they fail, the Hacker gains 3 Resources from their newfound net-cred for evading The Corporation.

## Heart Light

```
A melancholy game for 2 players.

The Kid befriends a strange being: an alien, a faerie, a ghost. The Adult has been on the hunt for just such a being.

One player is the Kid, the other, the Adult. Starting with the Kid, alternate answering the questions. Ask each other to elaborate.

KID | ADULT
How are you different from other kids your age? | When you were that age, what did you long for?
How did you and your Friend find each other? | What caused you to miss the Friend’s arrival?
How was life hard before your Friend arrived? | What’s missing from your life now?
How did you become Friends? | What doesn’t the Kid know that means the Friendship won’t last?
What does your Friend truly want? | What obstacles do you place in the way?

CRISIS
In short sentences, alternate describing the Crisis that draws the Kid, the Friend, and the Adult together, but endangers all 3.

KID | ADULT
How do you and the Adult bond over the Friend? | How do you and the Kid bond over the Friend?
How does it leave? | What do you regret about its departure?
What does it leave behind? | What does it leave behind?

## Cross the Floor

```
Two players.  

Long ago, you were close beyond ordinary love or friendship.  Then you betrayed one another.  

Decide together:  
- Where were you then?
- What did you share?
- What did each person do wrong?

Decide alone in secret:
- Why was this of all actions a great betrayal?
- What different life do you have now?

You have not seen one another since, until this moment.  It doesn’t matter where you are or what brought you here.

Decide together:
- How long has it been?
- What is different about the world these days?

Decide alone in secret:
- Why do you have nothing to lose?


Stand at the opposite ends of a large room.  

Make eye contact.  

It begins.

Walk slowly toward one another at the correct pace.

When you meet, at the right moment, raise your hand before you in a fist.

Make eye contact, take one breath together.  Release it.

Then open your hands.  Palm up means you choose to forgive them.  Palm down means you choose to kill them.

Look upon the result.

In a few gestures, act out what happens.  

Then hold your final positions until it is time to let go.

## Cast-a-Quadrans

```
Materials:
A pencil, a 3”x5” notecard, two coins, some poor fool to be your Game Moderator, already knowing what a “RPG” is.

Characters:
Write out a description on the notecard. Make it cool but not stupid. If the the GM doesn't like or can’t read it, erase everything, start over.

Adventures:
Read good books, watch cool movies, riff away on your own version.

Actions:
When something is in doubt, toss a coin, heads you succeed, tails you fail. If things are in your favor, flip two coins and succeed if either lands heads. If you’re disadvantaged, flip two coins and fail if either lands tails. GM and player hash out what failing, succeeding, advantaged and disadvantaged actually means. What’s written on your card matters.

Damage:
If you get walloped, flip your card over; you can’t use any of the stuff written on it until you’re fixed. If another really bad thing happens before you’re fixed, game over.

Advancement:
Mark your card’s corner when the GM agrees you’ve achieved something especially awesome. After you’ve marked all four corners, get a fresh card, rewrite your character, but a little more amazing now.
```

## (Dis)Agreement

```
A roleplaying exercise for two players

Prep: Choose a genre and list a few types of characters you would expect in such a story. Pick one each to play and come up with a personal disagreement between these two characters.

Ready: Mark off the center and ends of a straight line at least twelve feet long.
Set: Choose opposite ends and stand equidistant between your end of the line & the center with your back to the center.

Go: In character, voice your opinion on the disagreement. Whenever your character wants to listen to the other, turn towards them. Whenever your character wishes they didn’t have to listen, turn away. Whenever you feel closer to agreement, step towards the center. If you feel farther from agreement, step away from the center.

Finish line: Normal play ends when either player reaches their end or the center. Neither player can thenceforth speak, but the other player may immediately walk to the center or their end.

<hr> 

## The faithful few

```
Game is for three to eight players.

Players all work for a temple and the deity has decided that they should die, though one might be spared. Players can play solo or try to make allies with others.

The objective is to kill your opponents and stay alive. All can die (no winners), only one can remain alive.

It uses one or two typical poker cards deck with no jacks. Each player chooses a suit, mixes them and places the pile back up in front of him. 1d6 for player is used for damage.

On a piece of paper each player should write:
Character’s name, description, brief back story. The description should include what position the held at the temple and backstory how they got there, how long ago and what they used to do before.

Each round the players draw the top card. Highest begins it and so on. Even card means can attack. Odd can defend. They are not obligated to do that but must narrate if they prepare for a future attack.

Health pool is 25. Damage is calculated by the difference between the attacker and defender dice. Negative is damage to attacker.
