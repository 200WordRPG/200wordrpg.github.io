### Featured:

[Epidiah Ravachol](http://www.worldswithoutmaster.com/) is going to read through all of the entries and pick out entries that would be a good fit for his E-zine. His choices will be completely independent from the judges. If he chooses your entry, heâ€™ll contact you with his offer, and provide more information.
