# Small Beginnings

The 200 Word RPG Challenge has become a fantastic starting point for many new creators. Some have even gone on to turn their entry into a larger game! If you took your 200 word rpg to the next level please tell me about it! I want to feature your story here along with the others. Email me at davidschirduan-at-gmail.

## Success Stories

[Kintsugi](http://schirduans.com/david/kintsugi) started this whole adventure, and now I'm proud to say that it's a fleshed out, beautiful little one-page game that has been enjoyed by many! Heck, maybe you'll enjoy it too! - [David Schirduan](http://schirduans.com/david/)
