# Create a role-playing game<br/>in 200 words or less.

## Why 200 Words?

A 200 word limit encourages creativity and demands the very best of your editing and writing abilities. While making a game in 200 words can be difficult, itâ€™s less of a daunting commitment than editing and proofing 85 pages with art and layout.

## Plaintext?

Visual presentation can be a large and scary problem. Very few people are masters of writing, editing, art direction, graphic design, layout, and marketing. It usually takes a village to make a game. We want participants to focus solely on the challenge of creative writing and brutal editing.

## Encourage the Community

Not only does this give experienced designers a chance to flex their muscles, but it encourages new designers to show what they can do. Our biggest hope is that designers will find a submission that resonates with them, reach out to the author, and turn a little blurb into a larger collaborative project. That's why all submissions are protected under the [Creative Commons license]({{site.baseurl}}/licensing).
