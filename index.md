# The 2017 Challenge

## Design a role-playing game using 200 words or less.

Submissions will open April 15th. Until then, read the rules below and get started drafting ideas!

Entries will be reviewed by a panel of judges to determine the top 3 winners. Submissions will be evaluated by their Creativity and Engagement. The game doesn’t necessarily have to be "fun", but it should grab our attention and draw us in.

## Why 200 Words?

A 200 word limit encourages creativity and demands the very best of your editing and writing abilities. While making a game in 200 words can be difficult, it’s less of a daunting commitment than editing and proofing 85 pages of rules, complete with art and layout.

Conceiving, designing, and publishing a 200 word game is a great first step toward completing larger game design projects.

## Plaintext?

Visual presentation can be a large and scary problem. Very few people are masters of writing, editing, art direction, graphic design, layout, and marketing. It usually takes a village to make a game. We want participants to focus solely on the challenge of creative writing and brutal editing.

## Connect with Creators

Making and sharing a game is a great way to showcase your ideas and connect with new and more experienced game designers. Do you see a game that inspires you? The 200 Word RPG Challenge is a forge for new collaborations!

# Challenge Rules

### Submission Window
Entries will be accepted from the beginning of April 15th (00:01 EST) until the end of April 23rd (23:99 EST).

### Word Limit 
Each entry may not exceed 200 words.

Judges will be using the Google Docs word-count tool. Anything above 200 words will be immediately disqualified. Entries cannot be corrected or changed once they are submitted, so be sure to double, triple, and quadruple check your submission!

### Number of Entries
Each participant may submit up to two different entries.

Don't feel pressured to submit more than one game; it is better to have a single, polished game than two half-finished ones. 

### Publicly Posted
Each entry will be publicly posted on <this page>. We reserve the right to reject entries that we consider to be inappropriate or offensive. 

### Licensing
All entries will be submitted under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) License. That means that anyone can remix, modify, expand, or build upon these entries, and even make money off of them! [More info here]({{site.baseurl}}/licensing).

Judging Process

*Round 1* (April 26th - May 3rd)
Judges will be assigned a number of entries to read (so that each entry is read by at least 2 judges). Each judge will select their top 4 entries, writing a short spotlight about each one and why they chose it. 

*Round 2* (May 5rd and May 6th)
Judges will read through the semi-finalists and give every entry a "yay" or "nay" based upon whether they think that game deserves to win. The entries with the most “yays” will be the finalists (might be 3, might be 7).

*Round 3* (May 7th)
All judges will have a face-to-face meeting and unanimously agree on the top 3 winners. The winners will be announced and rewarded on May 8th, Monday morning!
