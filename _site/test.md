## Finalists

**Is The Space Pope A Lizard?**
This was probably my favorite out of the list. A fun, engaging concept that I could easily see myself playing or running. The rules were clear and easy to follow, the game didn’t take itself too seriously, and I loved the idea of an alien conclave. - Jacqueline Bryk

**Estate** 
A quiet, domestic little game with a great set of themes. Estate has an elegant ruleset, great flow, and potential for very emotional, involved sessions.  - Jacqueline Bryk

**Survival of the Femmest** 
This deserves to be a semi-finalist at very least due to its innovative subversion of standard masculine scifi/fantasy tropes. Players triumph against their enemies through traditionally feminine ideals and graces, which are never put down or made fun of. Unique, charming, and definitely made me want to play at least one session.  - Jacqueline Bryk

**A Broad Entered My Office** 
This game drew me in with the title, and didn’t disappoint. A cheeky little noir game with fluid roles and an endless possibility of scenes. The ruleset is clear and fits the desired tone, and it would be super easy to pick up and play. This could play anywhere from a serious noir film to an overblown pastiche of the genre and I’m loving it. - Jacqueline Bryk

**Omelette Quest** 
I loved this game because it’s truly all-ages. You could play this at a drunken convention party or with a bunch of kids in a schoolyard. The rules are simple, the concept is engaging, and it involves a lot of simple physical exercise--something most of us could use more of. - Jacqueline Bryk

**Adventures in a Wild World** 
A quick, solid idea generator. This would be an invaluable tool for GMs of various levels of experience who have problems with improv or just want to add a little more depth to their plots. - Jacqueline Bryk

**A GM’s Guide to Session Prep and Play** 
This supplement really caught my eye because of the way it chooses to approach session prep. The use of dice to determine small, easily-achievable goals gives the whole process the air of a minigame, and I could see myself using it before running a game. A nice, stress-light way to get stuff done. - Jacqueline Bryk

**Soluble Sahuagin** 
What a great set of weird and unique monsters! A good tool for GMs who want to add a little bit of strangeness to their game. Could fit into most settings, would be best in horror. I love the new monsters that aren’t just “another flavor of dragon” or “mammal crosses with reptile/insect”. - Jacqueline Bryk

**Stardust** is a quiet game about people who were once stars. Right way you notice the game’s writing - it’s clear, emotional, and ritualistic. The game perfectly balances the tone between comfort and sorrow. It’s a short game that accommodates a range of players, from solo play up to a large group, and takes place outside, at night! You even get to play with fire… - Marshall Miller

**Walk Among the Dead** is a freeform game about questioning the dead. Players take turns wearing a mask and risking their life to find closure with the one they lost while the others play [mostly] truthful ghosts whispering back. The game accommodates various group sizes and range of potential stories while maintaining focus on its premise and giving players clear instructions about what they should be doing. - Marshall Miller

**Bangarang** comes at you fast -- you can feel the urgency and excitement in rules! The game has a really clear procedure, leading you through the three scenes and straight to the Showdown without putting any speed bumps in your way! I love the silly, over-the-top premise and scenes are just perfect the genre. - Marshall Miller 

**Die, Niruth, Die!** tells the tale of a great dragon’s life from birth to death. The game makes great use of dominoes to create a timeline from the “bones” of the dragon and the available themes really nail dragon lore. The rules lay out really clear procedures with a satisfying and well-defined beginning and end. - Marshall Miller

**Nos Morituri** is a game that revels in its visceral brutality. Set in the gladiatorial arenas of Rome, the game sets up its characters and knocks them down. It’s a competitive game but not in the way you might imagine -- the competition doesn’t stem from the game’s mechanics but from the players’ description of their gladiator’s bold entrance and agonizing death. The game really appeals to my sense of melodrama and one-upmanship. - Marshall Miller

**The Lost Cellar** provides a nifty way of creating a random path to Baron Niln’s store of wine. By cross-referencing a random sentence with you table of landmarks, it produces a thematically consistent and reasonably variable cellar that could be the entirety of an adventure all on its own. - Marshall Miller

**The College Animals** describes a delightfully bizarre mix of magic and mystery. There, ensorceled animals have created an academic cargo cult with predictably unpredictable consequences. - Marshall Miller

**Achievements** ports, well, achievements from video game systems over to the tabletop. What makes it interesting is that it’s the players creating the achievements, rather than the game or game master, flagging for one another the types of fiction, actions, and playstyles they want to see and conveying the relative importance (or challenge) of each achievement. - Marshall Miller

**Paranormal Rescue Squad** does some nice things with characterisation and improv, leaving plenty of room for players to sketch out a dangerous and unknown conspiracy and discover it organically through play. I think it’d make a great 500w game. - Grant Howitt

Come on, it’s called **Rad Hacker Vampires!** It’s ticking all my boxes - I like the theme, I like the stakes and the stats, and it really engages me. Out of all of the entries, this is the one that I’d like to play the most. - Grant Howitt

**Time Travel Thaw** has a really innovative theme - the idea that ice is melting and wiping out what makes you you due to wibblywobbly timey-wimey stuff. I’m not sure how well it would work in play, but the introduction of an uncertain element to the game both lends urgency and keeps the one-shot game from spiralling out of control. I’d love to run this and amp up the enthusiasm of the
players around the table. - Grant Howitt

**Dragon/Dragonslayer** is weirdly intimate. Like: you’re holding hands with someone, and one of you is a dragon, and the other is a dragonkiller, and you slay each other and talk at length about it without breaking eye contact? That sounds very challenging to pull off, and I’ll not lie, actually pretty hot. - Grant Howitt

• A broad entered my office: The concept of a player taking on the role of the PI’s narrator is genius, and that’s enough for me to warrant voting for it. Plus it does some fun things with narrative control and power - I can imagine the PI trying to talk their way out of a situation and their narrator revealing that they’re lying through their teeth, which gives a nice rhythm to proceedings. - Grant Howitt

• Thematic Procedural Tables: The title is a little dry, but this is a sound way of generating interesting word seeds out of easilyunderstood concepts. I could see myself using this to blast out a setting for a one-shot game, either collaboratively or on my lonesome. - Grant Howitt


• 1-2-3 System: I’ve actually been looking for a ridiculously simple dice mechanic for a while that still offers something interesting to play with, and this works for me. I’d like to see it developed a little bit to see skills, traits or character stuff worked in (and the examples are a little screwy - remembering a phone number from 5 years ago, I’d argue, is a near-impossible task) but it’s a solid core for running a game when you’re drunk, and I like that. - Grant Howitt

• Foam Dart System: Non-Expanding Recreational Foam is one of my favourite things, and this is a fun mechanic for using it in a game. I can see the players messing about at a late-night session with this one and having a lot of fun, and it makes a break from entirely removing skill from proceedings as most systems do. - Grant Howitt



• Deconstruction is a fascinating rpg. It’s exploring the power of words. I love using words and misunderstandings of them and how that shapes a culture as a world-building concept. I haven’t seen anything like it. - Sarah Judd

• Walk Among the Dead seems to have a chance to pack an emotional  punch in a small package. Each player has something interesting to do to shape the game at all times. It seems like the mechanics would help create the tone. - Sarah Judd

• Babble: Like Deconstruction, Babble plays with the concept of communication in a fascinating way. Not being able to communicate normally with several players provides a compelling, creative roleplaying challenge. - Sarah Judd

• Flame War: I laughed when I read this description. The mechanics weren’t very creative, but they support the engaging and creative theme well. I can imagine certain rpg groups I’ve been in having a blast with it. - Sarah Judd

• Recovery:The rules here are crunchy, but it makes perfect sense. Recovering from addiction forces people to balance hard decisions. Harsh but compelling subject with thematic implementation. - Sarah Judd

• Foam dart.I could see games where this technique might add to the immersion, and certainly several where it would add to the fun. - Sarah Judd

• First Steps - Adventuring Workshop. I frequently have a hard time coming up with interesting characters that don’t feel like someone else’s tropes. I like bouncing ideas off of other people, so I love “I see.” I also get into character more easily by introducting my body, so I love “Quoth.” Actually having reasons to travel together is important too. Interesting and useful character building technique. - Sarah Judd

• Everyone is GM. Cute. People like playing meta. - Sarah Judd




• Rad Hacker Vampires: I feel like this captures the gritty Vampirehorror genre that a lot of gamers really enjoy, without a lot of overly complex mechanics. It’s more complicated than rock-paperscissors, but it fits in 200 words. - Stephanie Bryant

• Time Travel Thaw: I loved this mechanic of melting ice! Depending on where you live, this might be a very fast game, as you quickly run out of powers a desert climate! - Stephanie Bryant

• Stardust: There were a number of combat-free games in this batch, but I thought Stardust did the best at conveying the mood the game is trying to capture, in a very short amount of space. - Stephanie Bryant

• Heavy Metal Wizard Sorcerers: I picked this because after reading through over 80 entries, it was one of the ones that completely stuck out in my mind as “I want to play this!” - Stephanie Bryant

• Final Sanctuary: Not surprisingly, I like a good “30 seconds to midnight” type of game, and the “fluff” text in this one captured the time pressure very eloquently. - Stephanie Bryant


• Vampire Dark: Again, there’s that Vampire-horror, this time blended with Cthulhu Dark. Good pick for system for this setting. - Stephanie Bryant

• You’re Nothing But a Pack of Cards! As I understand it, A Red and Pleasant Land is a good system for random encounters, and this captures a sense of dark whimsy that I think fits the game well. - Stephanie Bryant

• Entrenched: A good little underwater adventure. Could easily be tweaked to a modern fantasy in addition to high fantasy settings. - Stephanie Bryant


• Out of the Crucible, A Fire: fun camping activity. succinct. mission debrief done in character. builds naturally, could be a really cool night. will play. - Kat Kuhl

• Stop Hiding Your Crush - love it will play. captures sleepover party fun. established characters makes this effervescent. - Kat Kuhl

• Hi - would play. noticing unspoken things. series of unique thinkpieces per character well formed. want to play both sides. will probably use as a mini-game for actors before they get on mic
for romantically charged scenes. big fan - Kat Kuhl

• deconstruction - would play - scrabble pieces are tangibly fun. teaches an element of worldbuilding oft forgotten. deliberate mispronunciations = easy enjoyment. accessible to many age groups/backgrounds. - Kat Kuhl

• Drink Tea Forget - will play - solid game for one. less vague than many. actionable, encourages engaging with the activity and mindfullness. - Kat Kuhl

** The host ** - fun minigame that ports to most systems. solid exposition engine. - Kat Kuhl

**super simple magic for fate core** - breaks down simply what’s fun/unfun about magic and similar - Kat Kuhl

** *Ghæstlean* ** - solid story seed. drink detail is strong. enough to work with without hampering GM creativity. - Kat Kuhl
