## Purgatory

```
You’re mortals in the war between heaven and hell; they’re both awful. Heaven’s angels oppress mortals while hell’s demons subvert them. God isn’t exactly good and Satan isn’t always evil, but both want to rule Purgatory, our world.

Choose your training: socializing, technology, weaponry, academics, survival, or larceny. Your clothing is: stylish, stealthy, or reinforced. Your weapon is: long-range, silenced, or melee.

Pick a number between 2 and 5. Higher is for orderly things: planning, machinery, problem solving, and persuasion. Lower is for chaotic things: improvisation, brawling, athletics, and deception.

For each task, roll 3d6. For orderly tasks, roll your number or lower. For chaotic tasks, roll higher. If you’re trained, geared, or prepared, reroll one failure for each. If you’re wounded or demoralized, reroll one success for each.

One success is partial, two is solid, and three is great. Roll all ones (holy trinity) and something heavenly happens. Roll all sixes (number of the beast) and something infernal happens. Roll all exactly your number for amazing success.

You’re up against angels and demons, all terrifying monstrosities, as well as humans who picked sides. Your goal is to restore holy sites (to contain heaven) and destroy gates (to seal hell).

## Border Crossing

```
You stood in line waiting for hours on a bridge to cross into the United States. Your university is on the other side, and you have class today. Now you just need to go through the border patrol checkpoint. Roll a 1d6 and consult your results. 1-2: You are a Mexican born citizen with a student visa. 3-4: You were born in the United States, but your parents live in and are from Mexico; they hope you can have a better life. 5-6: You are an American born student who just went to Mexico for fun. Roll a 1d6, then add your first result. 10+: You have no problem; have a good day. 7-9: They ask a bunch of questions, making you late and annoyed. 6 or less: You spend the next several hours in a room where they ask you questions like: "Why are you crossing?", "What were you doing in Mexico?", "Why do you want to go into the United States?" You miss all your classes, and after a while they let you go. Once in America, discuss why you think the border patrol treated you a certain way, and how you feel about it.

## Magical Spaceship Adventures

```
You are the crew of the Lucky Star, a magic-fueled spaceship held together by equal parts imagination and duct tape.

Pick a vocation:
     -psychic
     -warrior
     -priest
     -thief

Pick a job:
     -captain
     -boatswain
     -navigator
     -cook

To resolve conflicts, roll 2d6 and add one if your vacation/role applies or two if both do.  If the result’s from 7-9, you succeed and pick a complication.  If it's 10+, you don't pick a boon.

Complications:
    -Someone's hurt
    -Something's lost
    -It gets weirder

Traveling through space gets weird real quick. Weird starts at two and increases by one when a conflict is resolved and the 'It gets weirder' complication is selected.  If your unmodified 2d6 roll is <= the weird, it's a failure. If your roll's 10+ and > weird, you can receive a complication and reduce weird by one.  At weird 12, the Lucky Star and its crew become so improbable they are wiped from existence.

The admiral’s a special player who controls everything except for player characters. 

They canNOT:
     -railroad
     -deus ex machina
     -restrain the weird
     -bore the players

## Wittgenstein's Monster

```
We all know the story: In his secluded alpine castle Doctor Wittgenstein sought to create game from gamelessness, stitching together parts from other games and infusing them with the spark of gamemastering. But in his hubris Wittgenstein lost control of his creation, and spent his remaining life repenting, claiming it was madness to think games had an essential nature, that by merely looking you can see there's no common thread. But what if...

You are Dr. Wittgenstein, and you are gamemastering a roleplaying game for some of your friends (gather some players to play the role of the mad doctor's friends). Gather your library of roleplaying games to serve as the basis of your possibly monstrous creation. Pick one at random and begin explaining how to play based on the text. However, whenever the rules refer to a concept, procedure, or section of rules other than the paragraph you're referencing, you must pick another game at random and find a corresponding concept, section, etc. from that game (unless it's referring to an already established connection, in which case use what you've already determined).

Play the RPG as long as you can, until it destroys you or your triumph is established.

## Dumb Brutes

```

It’s the Stone Age. You live in caves. You probably hunt mammoths or something. It’s a living.
 
Find a place to play. This place should either have some dirt or some walls.
 
Create characters. Consider:
• What feature makes you different from your peers?
• What is your best skill (e.g., clubbing, fire)?
• What Great Threat kills almost everyone you know? What is most terrible about it?
 
Good! Now stop talking. You may grunt or draw pictures in the dirt or carve them into the wall.
Work together to illustrate the story of the time your people overcame the Great Threat. Don’t get fancy.
Collectively come up with a sound to describe this experience.
Finally, individually draw or carve an epilogue depicting your eventual brutal death.
 
Discuss!
 
Campaign variant: Play as the descendants of the previous characters. Play is the same, except you may use the sound you created to communicate.

## [TECH]: Boldly Go (a Starship Simulator)

```
GM creates narrative and presents challenges. Players overcome challenges and help shape narrative.

Shuffle a poker deck. Reshuffle as needed.

Players choose rank (and draw hand size):
Captain, 5
Commander, 4
Lieutenant Commander, 3
Lieutenant, 2

And department:
Command
Science
Medical
Engineering
Security

To overcome challenges, players play cards and combine values. Redraw rank value when cardless. (Keep hands secret.)

GM presents a challenge. Together, choose characters being challenged. Reveal one seed card from the deck (two if one character is challenged alone).

Challenged players, in whatever order, narrate their action (use technobabble!), and must add one card, attempting to total 17-21 (like blackjack: aces are 1 or 11; face cards 10s).

Narratively, consider black cards as “and...”; reds as “but...”

21? Direct hit! (Or whatever’s dramatic...)

<17 or >21 fails! Another challenge escalates, and GM’s choice: a character’s injured (hand size -1; discard immediately), or system’s damaged.

When systems (shields, weapons, engines, etc.) take damage, one player plays a card to its total. If >21, it’s destroyed. Healing/repairing is a challenge; remove one damage or injury.

When challenges factor in departmental expertise, players may replace any played card (even the GM’s) with one of theirs of matching suit.

## The Life of Paul

```
Life of Paul

The life of Paul is an interesting one. Everyday he wakes up and is thrust straight into an adventure. Everyday he dies. This repeats until the Fates (you) get bored. 

Using a 20 sided dice you control his fate. When you roll to determine how his day is going use a scale of 1-20. 1 is the worst outcome, 20 is the best. Paul is a mundane person with no negative or positive traits. 

Game play goes as follows
Paul wakes up…
Player rolls (6 not great).
Paul has a head ache.
Next player rolls… (16 very good)
But it is easily fixed with some water.
Next player rolls… (5 much worse)
The water was poison, he has 12 hours to find a cure.
And so on…

Players are encouraged to just give bullet points but longer descriptions are ok too.
Don’t take too long since the game is meant to be fairly fast paced and improv based. 
Every day of Pauls life begins with him waking up and ends with him dying or going to sleep (for continuity's sake).

## I Feel Fine

```
The world ends in one hour, and nobody knows. Not even you. Instead, you, like many others, are posting selfies of your day to social media. You will continue to do this up until the final moment. Until it’s too late.

Play begins as soon as you finish reading this. Do something interesting today and take selfies and photos of the process, sharing those on social media as you take them. Use it to tell a story about yourself and who you are: maybe one of your hobbies, your friends, a tour of your apartment, etc. Document as much of your final day as you like, primarily through pictures, and show us a journey of everything you feel makes you special. 

Play ends in the middle of an activity, never after, but it can be in the middle of an activity you choose, Take your final selfie: that moment you realize everything will be gone in a second and this is the end. Do you see it coming? Is it terrifying? Do you panic? Or is it quick and sudden?

```
<hr> 

## MECHANICAL ORYX

```
You have many whirring eyes and strong, beautiful coiled-steel legs and were made long ago when the cities still stood. 

You spread one: plants, light, music, warmth, power, knowledge, rust, something else. The longer you stay in one place, the more intense it gets. You have three installed modules; tell us what they do.

You walk the green places where soft brown people tend to fruit-trees and sing songs they don’t understand. 

They pray: DISPEL THE CURSE ON OUR VILLAGE; DESTROY THE PHANTOMS THAT PLAGUE US; TEACH US THE SONG THAT MAKES THE FRUIT GROW.

When you act and the outcome is in doubt, roll 2D6 and spend fuel; if you get seven or more, you achieve your aims. If you roll a double, your solution causes an unexpected problem and something is lost forever. 

When you act with love, roll 1D4+1D6. When you act with hate, roll 3D6.

You have 10 fuel. When you have none, you stop.

When you use a module, replace one D6 with a D8; if it shows 8, the module breaks.

Happy people build shrines for you containing fuel and modules. Without the shrines, you will become a dangerous, scavenging thief: a phantom.

## Double-O-Eleven: Casino Vocale

```
Players are Superspies. One player is a Villain.

Character Creation: choose Vocal Traits, such as:

annoying – gravelly – high-pitched – hoarse

A player is “In Voice” when the player speaks using these Vocal Traits. Anything else and the player is “Out of Voice” which ends their turn! All players receive ten tokens. The Villain describes a trap in which each Superspy finds
themselves. The Villain tells them the Plan. The Villain speaks “In Voice” or hands the Superspy who caught them “Out of Voice” a token.

Play resumes clockwise (using timed turns of a minute) with Superspies and Villain describing their actions to foil or complete the Plan. When “In Voice” everything they do succeeds. Speaking “Out of Voice” ends a player’s turn, and they must give the Villain a token.

When a player leaves a room, their turn ends. The Villain can describe a setback during their turn.

The game ends if:

The Villain has no tokens (player who last caught the Villain
“Out of Voice” describes how they foil the plan)

or

The Superspies have no tokens (Villain describes their demise). A superspy that without tokens is dead and takes no turns (the Villain narrates).

## Remember the Glory Days?

```
OVERVIEW
You are a group of elderly second-string superheroes trying to remember your glory days.

SETUP
Players decide on superhero names, secret identities, and powers.
Number a sheet of paper one to twenty.

GAMEPLAY
Roll 1d20 to determine who remembers an adventure from yesteryear.

Winner begins by roleplaying and recounting the event. Using a pencil, write as much of that memory as possible on the first line.

In clockwise manner, players roll 1D20 to see if their memory matches what has been shared.
If the result is equal to any empty line, that player roleplays their disagreement and writes over, in pen, 1D20 penciled words of the last line. Otherwise, they agree, in character, with the memory.

When all players have the chance to disagree, play continues and the next player recounts a portion of the memory on the next empty line.

Game ends when the last line of the page has been written and any disagreements are settled.
Meanwhile, banter like old forgetful friends do.

SCORING
Players add their score as follows:
300 points - Staying in character.
200 points - Each uncorrected line.
25 points - Per word written in pen.

Loser reads the full story in character.

## The Duelin' Blues

```
Requires:
Musical instruments
Improvisational talent
A deck of cards

First, get yourself a band of friends and sit down with your instruments. Declare the characters you will be playing so that the others will be able to properly judge you later. One person is the Barkeep, describing the ruffians that come in and make trouble. Invariably, it seems, anyone who walks in the bar is looking for a fight (or a debt or a bounty, whatever the Barkeep deems) and with a player no less. The Barkeep will draw a card and describe a foe who’s picking a fight with the player to the Barkeep’s left (then to the left of him, etc). The player must then play a riff - a few bars, or longer if the group desires - that fit the character and the drawn card’s theme; the group decides democratically what fits or not. The consequences for failing are varied but often dire. Once you’re out of cards, it’s closing time. Go home.

A - Fast: 144+
2 - Minor
3 - Drawn out
4 - Arpeggio 
5 - Bluesy
6 - Legato
7 - Stacatto
8 - Syncopated
9 - De/crescendo
10 - Chromatic
J - Forte
Q - Includes player’s highest known note
K - Lowest known note

## NATURE PLANET

```
For Four Players.
You are a NATURE DOCUMENTARY CREW led by a Steve Irwin-like host. 

Pick a natural setting (Outback, Serengeti...). 

Each player writes 2 challenges that could arise there (related to WILDLIFE, TERRAIN, PEOPLE, or GEAR) on separate index cards and rates one Normal and one Tough. Shuffle face down.

One player is the Host (knows wildlife) and to overcome challenges must DESCRIBE or INTERACT,
One is the Guide (knows terrain) and must NAVIGATE or COMMUNICATE, 
One is the Producer (knows people) and must WORK THROUGH or NEGOTIATE, 
One is the Cameraman (knows gear) and must RECORD or IMPROVISE. 

Turn over a card to ENCOUNTER wildlife or other challenges, either normal (roll 4+) or tough (6+). Challenges are faced by all characters in any order (narrate how your character does this) using a d8 against the challenge number. Roll twice if it’s something you KNOW. On failure, players describe the “blooper” that results and introduce a new unexpected wrinkle to the challenge. 

Each other player must act before a player may act again. 

Once players have 3 successes, flip the next card. 

Game ends once all ENCOUNTERS are overcome. Each player then gives their Oscar speech for the documentary.

## Stranded In Space

```
Game Setup:
* Your spaceship malfunctions. You send a distress signal. It will take ONE YEAR for the rescue ship.
* You crash your ship near an island on a water planet. The island is perfect: fruit, animals, fresh water.  The weather can be rainy, but otherwise it’s perfect. You could survive the whole year with nothing but what is on the island.
* Your spaceship has a replicator machine on board that can materialize any items you want, but…
* Your spaceship’s power is low. And it’s sinking very slowly.

Play:
* You have just enough power to make 200 pounds worth of stuff.
* Then the ship sinks.
* Make a list of what you take onto the island for your one-year stay.
* Discuss your year. 
* Best list wins.

On Game Play:
Remember, the island has everything you need for basic survival. What would make your year better?  Tools? Books? Cooking gear? How about a lighter?


Game Variations:
* Passenger: You may also bring one other person. Who?
* Lower Energy: 100 pounds of stuff.
* Add Danger: weather, monsters, etc…
* More/Less Time: Two years? Three months?
* Quick play: 10 minutes to make lists.
* Solo Play: Keep your list. Think about it.

## All Things Grow

```
This story takes as long to tell as a plant to grow.

Mother curls her hand — strong, calloused, beautiful — over yours. 
She has given you something — a sunflower seed. 
It presses against your palm. 
Her eyes shut.

Hold the seed, when you’re ready, plant it: 

Your mother is a babe. Pink and crying, feeding and growing.
Tell us about her home. What were her parents like?

When the first shoots arrive:

Your mother is a child. She is small and the world so big.
Tell us about her best adventures. How she was brave?

When the stalk grows strong, and leaves emerge:

Your mother is a teenager. Her territory grows. She is becoming more independent.
Tell us of her dreams. What is the future she hunts?

When the flower blooms:

Your mother atop the mountain she has climbed. 
She is all alone and all herself. She is smiling at the sun.
Tell us who your mother is. What limits has she shed?

Let the flower be. When you’re ready:

Cut it. 
Place it in a vase. That was your mother before you knew her. 
You don’t need the flower to know the rest of her story.

Grow.

## The day we were Free

```
	This game creates the narration a group of psychiatric patients produce to entertain a Visit. It revolves about their recent attempt to escape the asylum, how was their plan, what they did outside and how they were brought back.

	Players begin choosing their Patient's name and condition. Afterwards, they take turns Telling while the rest are Listening. At any point, a Listener can bid cigarettes to propose a question or add an interesting detail. If the Teller accepts, the Listener takes the Teller's place and elaborates.

	If the Teller gets boring, any bidder can propose a Chill Pill. When every available Chill Pill is being offered, or every Listener is offering one, the Teller will have to gulp one and resign its place to the highest bidder, getting no cigarettes. Bid cigarettes can be increased or decreased, Chill Pills can be taken back.

	Each Patient starts with five cigarettes (matchsticks). Begin with five Chill Pills (mints), the game ends when there are no more left.

	This Sunday, the Patients will tell the Visit the story of the Day they were Free.

## The Outsiders RPG

```
Those who know what is hidden protect the world. These Outsider characters are run by the players. Everything else is run by the Other.

Characters are a brief written description outlining look, attitudes, background, skills and experience. The group shares these descriptions and makes changes to their histories to link them to each other.

When a character tries something where failure would be interesting make an Action Roll: Player rolls 1, 2, or 3 D6s if their character is Unprepared, Ready, or Prepared (respectively) based on their character description and previous actions; Other rolls 1, 2, or 3 D6s for Stressful, Hard, or Long-shot actions (respectively); Player succeeds with one die higher than the Other’s highest. Two higher is a bonus and three higher is a crit. A tie means success with Difficulty or deadlock. Two dice under the Other’s top die is failure and Difficulty. Three under takes a character out (eg: KOed, flees in terror, mark makes public scene, etc).

Difficulty is a die added to Other rolls against that character. Difficulty is mental, emotional or physical stress that reduces character performance shown with coins or tokens placed on the character sheet and removed through meaningful character action.
```
<hr> 

## Fated Feud

```
Two RIVALS stand face-to-face and blade-to-blade! A third player is FATE.

Both rivals take five BREATH tokens. 

Secretly, FATE flips a coin to determine which rival they favor and records the name.

Every turn, flip a coin to determine which rival speaks first. Each rival describes an INDIGNITY that has driven them to duel. Then both players secretly and simultaneously spend BREATH in the following amounts to take one action:

0: BREATHE. (Gain one BREATH.)
1: PARRY. (Cancels an ATTACK or reduces FLOURISH damage by one.)
2: ATTACK. (Deals one damage.)
3: FLOURISH. (Cancels another FLOURISH; otherwise deals two damage.)

Rivals hold their action tokens in their fists. 

FATE chooses which INDIGNITY was most grievous. The aggrieved party earns a BREATH. If FATE chooses one rival three times in a row, the unchosen rival may CURSE FATE and remove them from the game.

Rivals reveal tokens simultaneously, resolve damage, then move to the next turn. Each turn, rivals describe the INDIGNITY that led them to commit the INDIGNITY their rival last described.

Each rival has seven health. Once a rival reduces their opponent to zero health, they win. If FATE’s favored rival wins and they are uncursed, they also win.

## The story of my life

```
A game for waiting in line in a public place.

You're dead. So are all those ahead and behind you in line. The queue for the after-life is long, slow, and winds through the living like torture, reminding you of what you no longer have. You do have your memories, well some of them. You will need to tell the arbiter your life story. 

Everyone has heard rumors of themes the arbiter appreciates. Share these rumors. 

It’s time to practice.


Take turns
Begin your saga with, "It all started when..."

Continue your tale until you reach a crossroads, where the details are fuzzy, request suggestions to impress the arbiter from your companions. Let the suggestions simmer as you listen to your companion’s tales. 

When it is your turn again, continue your story. Repeat crossroads as needed. 

When you reach your conclusion, finish with, "and that was the story of my life." 

Continue until all tales are told... or you've reached the arbiter. 



May your stories amuse and impress...

Prompts
Let the surrounding living and location inspire.
How/when/why did you die?
What did you die for?
Who will miss you?
What/who will you miss?
What was left behind?

## The Hands of Rasputin

```
Use one hand as your character - a rotting servant of Rasputin! Scuttle. Roll dice with other hand. 
Pick a Russian name. 

Your goals: hunt and kill the Romanovs to gain the most points! 

Turns: Choose a Romanov. Another player creatively narrates their castle escape attempt. You narrate your murder attempt, then roll the dice. 

Miming and/or Gory Description grant +1 each. 

Meet/beat the Romanov value to eliminate them. Also gain that many points:

Baby Alexei                 4
Princess Tatiana        5
Princess Maria           5
Princess Olga             5		
Tsar Nicholas II          6
Tsarina Alexandra      7	
Anastasia                    8

Failure: hide one finger.
You’re eliminated from the game when all your fingers are gone. 
Individual Romanovs escape if unsuccessfully attacked three times. 

Victory is yours when it is impossible for others to win!

Example turn: 
Player A chooses Nicholas.
Another Player: “The Tsar is attempting to escape through a sewer.”
Player A: (Miming actions +1) “I scuttle and flush myself down a toilet, then I crawl down his throat, choking his windpipe.” (Gory Description +1)
Player A rolls a 3, adds bonuses to get five - enough to eliminate Nicholas and gain his 6 points. 
Next player’s turn.

## Flesh of the Gods

```
A pantheon of Gods tell tales of their attributes and patronage.

Each player writes a:

- Divine domain (e.g. Storms, Agriculture, Cats)
- A treasured possession
- Body part

Players randomly select one domain, possession, and body part to create their God.

Players also write three prayers (i.e. requests of a God), these are shuffled into a deck. Prayers can be as grand, solemn, trifling, or selfish as you like.

The starting God is whoever last ate an apple. The player opposite is the Village Elder this round and draws a prayer. They beseech the God for aid, the God must use the powers of their domain to answer the prayer. The God to the Elder’s left jealously intrudes and adds a complication. The God to the beseeched God’s left uses their possession to help overcome the complication. The beseeched God now gains an additional domain based on the prayer and the next God is beseeched.

Second time around it is the Gods to the right of the Elder and beseeched God rather than the left.

On the final round no other Gods intervene, the beseeched God must sacrifice their body part in order to answer the prayer.

## Poet Glorious

```
3-5 players

English haiku: a poem with three lines and syllable count of 5-7-5

Characters:

The land is overrun by demons. You are a glorious warrior!

Pick a Theme. Write a haiku about your splendour. 

Write a haiku, using another’s Theme, about your envy.

Play:

Pick two characters as focal characters. 

The other players create a Challenge together. Each writes a haiku detailing the Challenge using focal character Themes. 

Each focal character player secretly writes a haiku to defeat the Challenge. Pick one:
- Work together.
- Sabotage the other.

Reveal both haikus.

Both work together: 
- Challenge is defeated.
- Each writes a victory haiku and strikes one line from their warrior haikus.

Both sabotage:
- Challenge is undefeated.
- Each writes a shame haiku and strikes one line from their warrior haikus.

Only one sabotages:
- Saboteur defeats the Challenge and writes a victory haiku.
- Sabotaged character strikes one line from their warrior haikus.

When all lines from your warrior haikus are stricken, your warrior is dead. Choose one:
- Write a glorious haiku commemorating the death.
- Write a demon-inspired spiteful haiku. Any characters you choose strike one line from their warrior haikus.

Rotate to new focal characters.

End when one or none stands alive.

## Caution: Hot!

```
A semi-cooperative game for two players.

Make some tea.

While the tea's brewing:
    Together, think of two people (one per player) who're in a new relationship.
        In broad strokes, outline setting, situation, people.
    Individually, think about your character some more, add details.
        Write down four different long-term goals: Two life goals, two relationship goals.

Keep your goals secret!

The game's objects:
    Firstly, enjoy your tea.
    Secondly, fulfill at least seven goals.

When tea's served, take turns.
On YOUR turn:
    If no tea's left or it's gotten too cold to enjoy:
        Game over. Narrate an epilogue together (apart?); incorporate your (un)fulfilled goals.
    Else, let your tea cool/drink/refill your cup. Sketch a scene about one thing from the corresponding list (who/where/when/what/how/why).
        Either let your tea cool:
            - Spend time together.
            - They come closer to a revealed goal.
        Or drink from your cup:
            - Spend time with others.
            - They reveal a goal, then erase it. They write a new secret goal (they decide, no restrictions).
        Or refill your cup:
            - Spend time alone.
            - They reveal a goal.

On THEIR turn:
    Either
        drink from your cup, listening quietly.
    Or
        add to/change their narration, but don't drink.

## No Coincidence

```
Years ago, the world ended. You tell us how.
Both of us survived. I tell us why.
Both of us are walking across unpopulated lands. You tell us why.
We don't walk alone. We each say who we travel with, why they can't survive alone, and why we protect them.
In the distance, we spot each other. There is recognition: this isn't the first time we've crossed paths. I tell us how our last meeting started, you tell us how it ended.
We are dangerous people. You tell us why.
We haven't let the apocalypse take our humanity. I tell us why.
We are near each other now, us two and our companions. We each place a coin in our fist. Heads up, we are peaceful. Tails up, we are violent. We reveal our coins at the same time.
If I chose Heads, and you chose Tails, I tell us how you killed me, and you tell us why.
If you chose Heads, and I chose Tails, vice versa.
If we both chose Tails, you tell us how our companions go on without us.
If we both chose Heads, I tell us why we'll meet again.

## Why do I need a name?

```
One of you is new to this world. You could be an AI, a construct, a demon, an alien, a small child, a newborn dragon. No matter what, the world is strange and the people are stranger. Ask questions. 
  - Why is the sky orange? 
  - Why does your arm make buzzing and clicking noises when it moves?
  - Why did you put the sword through the guy with pointy hat and grey beard?

Keep asking follow up questions. When you understand respond with, “Thank you”. Now ask a new question to someone else.
-----------------------------------------
Everyone else
Who knows how you found this creature, you know what it is… but it is just now learning about you. It is strong and powerful and may just ruin your life some day, best keep it happy and teach it about this world so it can take care of itself, the world, and you.

Answer the questions to the best of your ability, or make something up, it’s not like the creature knows any better. The creature is impatient and mercurial, if you don’t have an answer ask for help from a companion.

## Talking Sticks

```
Every tree, every twig has a story, but no voice. This is a game about telling stories on their behalf.

Two or more players go into the woods and look for sticks. They must stay within earshot of each other. 

First one found becomes the talking stick. Its finder starts to talk about the stick. They describe who they are and what their stick is: wand, cudgel, primitive tool. Anything you could fashion from wood, enchanted (or not) in any way they desire. Then they tell a story about what their character is doing with their stick.

Anyone who finds a stick they think is longer than the talking stick can challenge it. They describe their character and say what their stick is. Then, they compare sticks. Longest stick wins and becomes the talking stick. Its owner describes how the challenge played out and continues the story.

Players may act out any part of the story, if they wish, using the sticks as props.

Once all players have had a talking stick, the current talker may end the story if they can think of a conclusion. Otherwise, continue until the the sticks or the stories run out.

## Boasters round the table

```

Boasters is a game for 3-5 players about a gang of old heroes reminiscing about their grand adventures.

1. Every player is handed one fate card.
2. The leader (rotated clockwise after each round) imagines an event the group did and starts the story. After one minute the other players each vote if they want the story to succeed or not. Each positive vote gives the leader a +1 to the roll, each negative gives a -1. The leader rolls two six sided dice to see if the story is true or not. 7+ for success, 6- for failure. 
3. If it’s a success the leader gets one boast point.If not then no point is given. The game moves on to the next player. The next player (counter-clockwise) has their turn continuing the story and telling the real truth and keeping the story going.
4.  After everyone has had a turn the next round begins and a new story begins
5. The game ends when one player has 5 points.

Fate cards can only be used once a round and give an additional +2 or -2 to a other players tale. You cannot use it on your own story.
```
<hr> 

## Medium Heavyweight

```
The players are the spirits of dead gamblers possessing a prizefighter. Spirits must reach a consensus to make the boxer act, but they've all bet differently on the outcome of the title fight.

First, each player secretly rolls a die and records the result. Evens they bet to win the fight, odds bet to lose.

Each round a timer is set for 20 seconds while players discuss strategy, then every player shuts up and writes an action on a slip of paper.

Punch: remove 1 HP from opponent
Clinch: regain 1 HP
Rope-A-Dope: the boxer loses 1 HP
Exorcise <player name>: remove named player from the game

If all actions submitted are different, or are all the same, the boxer is confused and loses 1 HP from being punched in the face.
If a majority of actions are the same, that action is performed.
If none of the above are true, the actions are placed in a hat and one is drawn at random to occur.

Both the boxer and the opponent have 3 HP. The opponent takes no direct action.

When either is reduced to 0 HP, each unexorsized player reveals their bet and wins or loses accordingly.
```
<hr> 

## Vain Superheroes

```
The superheroes have been defeated. The world now turns to unlikely saviors: celebrities. One player is The Nemesis (GM), who narrates their evil plan; the others choose their celebrity identities.

Government scientists have invented Super Serum, turning the chosen celebrities into a team of fame-seeking superheroes! While superheroes must work together to beat The Nemesis’s dastardly plot, only the superhero with the most Fame truly wins.

The players’ powers are only just starting to take shape. Going clockwise, give the next celebrity their super-identity and first superpower – make it hard for them to become famous! Every player starts with two vials of Super Serum; one extra goes to the player who gives the best identity. Throughout the game, vials of Serum can be injected in an ally to give them your choice of superpower.

Superheroes can overcome Challenges with their superpowers, rolling 3d6 against a Challenge Number (4-18) set by The Nemesis; this is set depending on how applicable the superpower used. On success, the player gains Fame equal to the Challenge Number. Otherwise, they are injured. Three injuries spells defeat; lose all Fame but keep playing!

## SMASH THE SYSTEM

```
Characters sneak into the domain of the corporate oligarchs, discover conspiracies, sabotage the machinery, steal files, and eventually bring the whole thing crashing down.

Core Mechanic: Whenever a character does something that might be noticed, they have to stack dice onto their tower. Stack 1 die for a quiet action like sneaking past a sleeping guard. Stack 2 for a dangerous action, like knocking out a few security cameras. 

When the dice tower collapses, players count the number of 1’s. These are “failures:”

0 failures: Whew! That was a close one. I guess no one heard that?
1-2: A nearby guard is alerted that a noise was made. Essentially the “?” state
3-4: One or two nearby guards are alerted and begin actively searching for the character. The “!” state
5+: A nearby guard radios in a disturbance and the entire area goes on high alert

When the players steal the files, throw the monkey wrench, or complete their objective, they knock over their towers. Each 5 or 6 rolled determines how effective / valuable their action was.

1-3: A small crack in the oligarchy
4-5: An expose of misdeeds, a critical file
6+: You’ve brought the company to it’s knees!

## A Game To Play When You Feel Hopeless

```
Things:
Some paper, pen. 
A trusted & supportive person to be your GUIDE.

Rules:
Share feelings and emotions HONESTLY to your GUIDE.
Your GUIDE is blind but they see the most clearly. You must show them everything through drawing and/or writing them down.

You are an ADVENTURER about to enter a dungeon where no other person has ever ventured into before. 


Prepare yourself and visualize the room you enter into.


Imagine one of your worst fears, failures as a DEMON and place it in the room. Prepare to engage.


DEMON attacks first with negative thoughts. Focus on each of them and write them down directly. Do not try to justify them.


Next you must relay the thoughts to your GUIDE. Talk with them and process the attacks together. You might feel uncomfortable, angry, and embarrassed. Try to explain why you feel those emotions.


When you feel stronger, face the DEMON again. If the attacks do not feel as intense then you have pacified it for now. Otherwise, repeat from 5.


Venture into the next room and repeat from 2.


You can exit the dungeon anytime you like. But when you reenter you must begin from the first room.

## Doomsday Cult

```
This game uses a standard 52-card playing deck. Each player starts with seven cards, and can keep them secret, or selectively reveal them at any time.

GAMEPLAY

The players are members of a doomsday cult, attempting to bring about the apocalypse. The GM narrates the story and describes the challenges the cult faces, drawing a card to represent each challenge, and placing it face down on the table.

Players must reveal a card from their hand to resolve each challenge, using its suit to help narrate their solution:

  - Clubs: Zealous cultists.
  - Spades: Arcane knowledge.
  - Hearts: Influence within society.
  - Diamonds: Funds and assets.

Show everyone the challenge card. Players who revealed a higher rank card of a different suit draw another card, discarding down to seven. Players who revealed a lower rank card (regardless of suit) must discard it, unless it’s their last.

ENDGAME

When the deck runs out of cards, the apocalypse begins! Everyone calculates their score, as if their cards were a poker hand. The GM does the same using the challenge cards.

If the GM wins, describe how the cult is thwarted. Otherwise, the player with the highest-ranking hand summons an Eldritch Abomination, and narrates the resulting apocalypse.

## They're just dice, right?

```
Four adventures enter an inn. They’re drawn to quiet corner with a small wood table.    Setting aside their gear they notice four odd looking dice on the table.    The Barbarian picks up the dice, examining them with a skilled eye.  

Nondescript but each movement of the dice produces a red glint. 

Unimpressed, the Barbarian tosses the dice back on the table.  With a red flash the doors to the inn bursts open.  A huge swamp troll scans the room and sees the four adventurers.  The troll charges the party; a massive hammer swinging wildly in the air.  “Hey, isn’t that…” Before the fighter can finish his statement he is flattened by the massive hammer with a sick sounding splat.  

Knocked off balance, the cleric hits the table causing its content to fly.  Instantly all four adventurers are sitting at the table with the Barbarian holding four dice in his palm.  
Unsure of what just happened, each adventurer glance around; no troll, no squashed fighter, nothing.  

The Barbarian lowers his hand, places each wood die softly on the table.  They slowly rise from the table heading to the door and quickly glance at the quiet little table in the back corner.

```
<hr> 

## Just Survive

```
The group defines the setting; the players just need to survive it.

Players roll a pool of D6 to overcome Obstacles that arise.
All characters begin with a pool of 3 d6.  Starting Resources are determined by backstory (3 or fewer).

Difficulty of checks is determined by the nature of the Obstacle:
Normal: 1 Success
Tough: 2 Successes
Hard: 3 Successes

A ‘Success’ is a result of 4 or higher.

Failing a roll removes a d6 from your pool.
Restore lost d6 by successfully helping others.

Players can co-operate and share 1 d6 - or turn their backs to save themselves.
If a roll is failed with a co-operator, the co-operator may volunteer their d6 be lost instead.

At character creation, players name a trait their character has. If that trait applies to a roll, they gain +1 bonus d6

Players may retrospectively expend a Resource to gain 1 bonus d6 - but must describe the Resource and how it is lost.

GM may award 1 Resource at their discretion on successes

If a character's pool reaches zero, they are gone forever.
A character may choose to sacrifice themselves to save another and donate their entire pool to aid another's roll.

## Flirt Party

```
Flirt Party 
for 20-50 players
by Johannes Oppermann

This is about daring to flirt. Bring your primary romantic partner. Don’t play if you hate watching them flirt! You don’t have a partner with you? Pick someone available, go on a 15 minutes date together and establish some history to play with.

Your partner picks your first flirt, you pick theirs. Start with the person your partner picked for you. Primary partners are off limits to each other until the endgame. A valid flirt is any unambiguous gesture of appreciation made towards a romantically compatible other person. Keep flirting until you run out of compatible partners.

Watch your primary partner while you flirt. Note who they flirt with, who flirts back, if you find them attractive yourself, and how you feel about it. Signal to your partner when you’re ready to end. When you’re both ready, leave for a private space.

Endgame: Sit with your primary partner and take turns describing what you saw. Compliment them on who flirted back, tell them who you found attractive. Be brief. End the game when both have mentioned everyone they saw. 

Congratulations, you have dared to flirt. If you’re still partners, you win!

## So You're Being Hunted

```
Follow these instructions, and you might just survive.
What’s in your pockets? That’s what you’ve got to work with. 
If you’re not already running, you should run. Now. 
Driving is fine so long as you’re not alone and someone else can read this to you.
What do you remember? How did this begin? 
And run.
1.Look at your surroundings. Don’t look back. What catches your eye? What about it reminds you of when it all went wrong?
And run.
2.Focus. What do you hear? How does it tell of the hunter’s approach?
And run.
3. Deep breath. What do you smell? What does it tell you about your hunter?
And run.
4. Be present. What’s that taste in your mouth? What feeling does it taste like? Is it yours?
And run.
5. Stay in the moment. As the air flows over you, what do you feel? Does it feel like escape? Like your fate is sealed?
And run.
Repeat steps 1 through 5 until you know you’re ready to fight or you can’t run anymore.
Confront your hunter with everything you have. 
What do you do? How?
Did you win? Did you escape?

## Memoriam Ignis

```
Magic is sad and beautiful. A chance to express yourself fully and make a difference, at the cost of your mind. Will you journey to make the world a better place? Or will you lord your powers over others? And more importantly, will you even still be "You" in the end?

Before your journey as a Wizard begins, commit to paper (Bond Paper recommended) your most treasured memories, enough to fill it with only a half-inch above, the sides, and bottom blank. Your SpellMaster (GM) then prepares a candle in front of you. As your journey starts he invokes the Spirit of Magic by bringing the candle alight. Your SpellMaster guides you on your odyssey and advises you in the manner in which your memories must be kindled in the Spirit of Magic to bring your spells to life. The more complex the spell you've described, the longer your memories stay wreathed in the Spirit of Magic and burned away. 

At the end of your adventure, when your SpellMaster extinguishes the Spirit of Magic, check how much you still remember of your old life. Are you still you? Are you better? Are you worse? And was it worth it?

## Goblins in a Trenchcoat

```
Host, explain to your audience that they are a crew of tiny aliens inside a humanoid robot, a host of spirits within the mind of some poor victim, or a stack of goblins in a trenchcoat.

Explain the tricky position the group finds themselves in and what their goal is and that they are only ever able to perform these four actions:

1) Violence       | 2) Flight
-------------------------------------
3) Interrogation  | 4) Resolution

Explain the immediate situation and poll your audience to decide on one of the four actions. If there is a draw, choose the action with the lowest number from the tied choices. Once an action is chosen, roll a d4. If the result of the d4 is the same as the chosen action, the action is successful without complication. If the d4 result shares only a single axis with the chosen action, that action is only partially successful or the success comes with a cost. If the d4 result shares no axes with the chosen action, that action is unsuccessful and the situation becomes worse. Narrate what happens until another action is required and then poll again. Continue until the group achieves their goal or the situation becomes untenable.

## Scry and Rescue

```
http://www.theonion.com/article/investigators-first-48-hours-most-critical-locatin-53174

Adults cannot enter the Wardrobe Realms.  Only children can save children.

GM & 3-5 players.
Everyone creates one Wardrobe faction -- Snow Queen, Dwarves, Quaddies, Dragons, Playing Cards, Pirates… then name the Realm.

Each child agent survived and escaped a Wardrobe Realm, once.
Pick two factions & fellow agents, and say for each if you are a...

Fortress -- calls, strengthen them.
Friend -- knows, act like them. 
Fright -- commands, harms them.


When you face your past, suffer: (pick your usual three)
Fear, recklessness, anger, depression, emotional shutdown, reenactment, regression, guilt, paranoia, defiance, obsession, pleasure-seeking.

The Agency is: Government (CPS?), Private Business, Clandestine, Church or Charity

The Agency seeks the Lost Child.  You must...

Find: are they hidden, transformed, guarded, integrated?
Free: bargain, fight, perform ritual, sneak.
Escape: flee, destroy, barricade, trick pursuers. 
Return: reintegrate, enlist, study, or mourn the lost.

...but the Scrying was: incomplete, misleading, compromised (by who?), years out of date (time dilation).

When you face trials, roll:
1d6 for each agent in danger.
1d6 for each relationship acted on.
Pairs succeed, or stave off complications or PTSD reactions.
Runs of 3+ create upcoming problems.
Triples create new relationships -- or stop PTSD even if alone.

## Rules lawyers

```
Rules Lawyers
is a game about making the rules via common law.

Each game begins with this Constitutution:

1.Parliament shall make rules, and the Court will interpret them.
2.The first session shall be one where Parliament convenes to decide on amendments. Every 2 hours in the game session, Parliament shall reconvene to write more amendments.
3.Amendments pass when half or more players vote in favour of it.

5.The GM will run the game and make up the rules of the game until someone registers disagreement with it.
6.Where disagreement is registered the Court shall decide the matter with the rules of the Constitution and previous precedent in mind. The Court is randomly selected from among the players and may not be the player who registered disagreement or the GM. They are the Claimant and Defendant respectively.
7.Where Parliament has not written a rule, the Court may develop a new rule. Parliament reserves the right to change the rules through Amendments.
8.A player may win this game.

## Why We Hunt

```
Your group gathers around the table to retell the story of their latest hunt. What you hunted, and how, will be revealed over time.

On scrap paper, write down the following:
Attributes
Strength
Speed
Smarts
Luck
Hunter’s Code: Write your personal code as a hunter (Example: Never stop the hunt, even if my legs give out)
Trophy 1, Trophy 2

Go around the table and describe your hunter, starting with a name and description. Choose a player to go first, they are the StoryTeller. The StoryTeller begins by setting the scene of the hunt, creating any details they want. At any point, a player can cross off one of their Trophies and inject a complication/question into the story. The StoryTeller crosses off one of their Attributes or Code, describing how it got them out of the bind. They may no longer use that in the hunt. The role of StoryTeller then goes to the next clockwise player. The hunt continues until all players have marked off their Trophies, or the group agrees the hunt was a challenging and satisfying one indeed. What will you hunt next?
```
<hr> 

## Cyber Beetles

```
The players are a couple in a cyperpunk world, both 100% flesh and bone. Begin by describing themselves: emotionally and physically, of their flaws and strengths in a world where augmentations to fix problems are available.

They take it in turns rolling a D6. Depending on the rolls, they will go in for surgery to have a body part replaced by something synthetic or metal. They will describe the effects of the new limb, difficulties faced, its style, etc. Akin to the game Beetle/Cootie. Consult the table below for each roll!

1: Replace right arm.
2: Replace right leg.
3: Replace left arm.
4: Replace left leg.
5: Replace torso. 
6: Replace head (only applicable once all other body parts have been replaced).

If a player rolls a number that they’ve rolled previously, the relevant body part malfunctions, and must be repaired. The player will then explore the process, implications, and consequences. If a player rolls a 6 early, explore the character’s desires and anxieties about replacing their body.

The game ends once a player has replaced their entire body. It is up to the players whether this is good or bad.

## World of Stats

```
EVERYONE:
What kind of Fiction do you want?
Discuss setting, goals, themes, tone, ridiculousness.

PLAYERS:
What is your +2 Stat? +1? -1? Write them on your (index) Card.
Stats can be anything: roles, skills, equipment, resources, concepts, like “Tough”, “Obscura”, “Bullets”, “Chaotic”, “Disenfranchisement”, “Beheading”.

The MC will guide a conversation about the Fiction.
Ask the MC about things.  
Say what you want to do.
Play to find out what happens.

When you do something with an important and uncertain outcome, describe your attempt and roll 2D6 plus/minus a Stat; the MC will say which.
On a...
10+, Success; MC might increase a Stat, maybe get a new +1 Stat. What is it?
7-9, Success with Complication in the Fiction.
6-,  Failure with Complication; a Stat might decrease, or get a new -1 Stat.

When Stats change, skip 0, and don’t go past +/-4.

When the Cards have no more room, how does the Fiction conclude?

MC:
Extrapolate from the Stats.
Challenge the Stats.
Describe changes to Stats.
Make interesting Complications.
Make outcomes matter.
Make new rules if you learn them.

## Caltrops

```
You are an expert thief with a trusty bag of caltrops who has (almost) completed a big heist. The guard chases you through the city, so escape or face capture. Choose a specialization which provides a dice pool of d4 and a special ability. 

1. Thief, 10d4. Spend a d4 to avoid combat. 
2. Swashbuckler, 8d4. Spend a d4 to parry and riposte. 
3. Arcane Trickster, 6d4. Spend a d4 to cast a minor illusion.
4. Assassin, 4d4. If Completely Successful on a kill, return a d4 to your pool

To complete a task, choose and roll a number of dice from your pool, then, count the number of fours (successes). Spend up to 2 successful d4 from the pool. 

0 – Failure
1 – Partially Successful
2 – Completely Successful

A “Flurry” occurs when one die remains, add all spent dice back to the pool then immediately roll them. On a failure, there is a major complication and you reduce your dice pool by half. Successes should be glorious and do not remove dice from the pool. Continue the chase. 


If your total dice pool is reduced to 1d4, you are captured. After two consecutive successful “Flurries” you escape. 

```
<hr> 

## One Last Job

```
A story-telling heist game for players and GM.

Players assume the roles of:
The muscle
The hacker
The cat burglar
The driver
Or other heist tropes. 

Players take turns drawing cards and explaining their scene. Each suit corresponds to an event type, the higher the rank, the harder the challenge:

Clubs are obstacles that character must accomplish, set by the GM. Players explain how they will deal with the obstacles, then roll:
2d6 >= card value = success.
Items/loot can be added before rolling. 

Hearts are flashbacks to explain a connection to the job or another player character. Higher card, the more emotional the scene should be. 


Diamonds are loot. Loot can be used to explain resources used in obstacles or flashbacks. The Ace is the maguffin needed to win the game.

Spades are the law. Similar to clubs but are people. Each success adds a 1-point disadvantage to future spade rolls. 

The game is won when a club card is played, the King, Queen and Jack of clubs have been played, and players have the ace of diamonds.

Players are eliminated if they lose a spade encounter. If the whole team is eliminated, the game is lost.

## Botany Bay

```
In the cut-throat world of 18th century botany, ensure scientific immortality by discovering the rarest plants.

Each botanist takes a sheet of paper and four Favours per botanist lecturing. Fold the sheet into four sections. Draw the following elements:
      A flower
      A leaf
      A root
      A seed

Describe each element with adjectives- “poisonous”, “stimulating”, “red”, up to ten across the plant.

In turn, botanists gives a short lecture on one element of their plant, referring to the illustration and description. Their audience may:
     1. Applaud- place Favours (up to the amount of nouns and adjectives) on the 
         element’s illustration. Reasons for applause might include:
              It is unusual or exotic;
              It is useful to society or industry, or to harm or heal;
              You’re playing politics, despite the dull nature of their plant.
     2. Scoff- discard two Favours to ridicule a claim and remove an existing 
         Favour given as applause.

Botanists may pool Favours to meet these costs.
Fierce debate is encouraged.
Proceed until every lecture has been heard, every Favour is spent, or until boredom sets in.

The botanist with the most Favours on their plant (minus any remaining Favours they still hold) is declared President of the Royal Botanical Society.

## Planetary Realtors

```
“How about this lovely little ice planet with unbeatable views of an exploding star…”

A game for a team of buyers representing a civilization in the market for a new planet, and at least one planetary realtor.

The buyers explain their reason for buying, and the realtor presents the buyers with three flawed planets in turn. The buyers find further problems with each planet and provide additional requirements related to their intended purpose for the planet. Really try to pick holes in the proposed planet, and be awkward with your additional needs. The realtor should try to play down the planet’s issues and find ways to satisfy the requirements.

If there is more than one realtor, they can represent the same three planets or they can have their own planets. Either way, they are competing for the sale.


The buyers roll for the basis of their needs:
  1  Farming
  2  Industry
  3  Leisure
  4  Military
  5  Mining / Resources
  6  Prison / Containment
  7  Refuge / Expansion
  8  “Science”

The realtor rolls for the basis of each planet’s main flaw:
  1  Dangerous location
  2  Extreme temperature
  3  Geological instability
  4  Habitation
  5  Radioactivity / Toxicity
  6  Sci-Fi weirdness
  7  Value to others
  8  Wildlife

## Who Am I To You?

```
Two players, each roleplaying someone in a long-term romantic partnership.

First, collectively create a thematically varied playlist of songs about relationships. 

Then, tell the story of your initial meeting, in character, like you are telling it to someone else at a party.  

Write “first meeting” on a sheet of paper and have an out-of-character conversation about your feelings about the scene. Collectively write a short description of it.

Press shuffle on your playlist. Listen to the first song, occasionally making eye contact with the other player. When it finishes, roleplay a brief moment in the life of the characters’ relationship, with the song as inspiration. Let these questions guide you:
-Where are we? What are we doing?
-How much time has passed since the last scene?
-What has changed?
-What are our conflicts? Our joys?

When the scene ends, write down a name for it. Have an out-of-character conversation about the scene. Collectively write a short description of it.

Repeat until the playlist ends or you reach a logical conclusion.

When you finish, read what you have written. Then, take turns looking the other person in the eye, asking “Who am I to you,” and answering that question in character.

## Rewrite

```
The first book was a roaring success. You have the adulation of millions of fans. Can you strike gold a second time? Or are you a one-hit wonder?

You’re parts of the author’s psyche: roll individually to see which STORY ARC you’re after.

Take turns producing a paragraph of story, rolling to incorporate a PLOT ELEMENT.

The publisher wants changes! Once everyone’s had a turn pick another section then change it, according to an EDIT roll. Continue until a result comes up a fourth time.

ROLL  STORY ARC                       PLOT ELEMENT               EDIT
1     Rags to Riches (rise)           Narrow Miss                Make it more like the first book
2     Riches to Rags (fall)           Moment of Levity           Punch it up a bit!
3     Man in a Hole (fall then rise)  Exposition                 Change up the character roles
4     Icarus (rise then fall)         Tempting Offer             Add another PLOT ELEMENT (roll)
5     Cinderella (rise-fall-rise)     Conflict                   Move a section. Edit for continuity
6     Oedipus (fall-rise-fall)        Character Defining Moment  Make it less like the first book

-SCORING-

6pts divided among those with the final STORY ARC.
2pts for going first.
1pt per first book reference.
-1pt per inconsistency added.
1pt if an EDIT got laughs.

Argue over what counts.

## Steampunk Serial

```
Reborn in a caste gated steampunk world, but to the lowest caste, Player A is furious that the higher castes are keeping secrets from the rest. Their last caste was archivist’s, which kept the secrets.

Player A’s character chooses to murder people to get the knowledge shared.

Player A uses 3D6 to choose what past lives they remember, and those are skillsets they use to commit these murders. (textiles, smithing, herbology, husbandry, woodworking, innkeepers)

Other players play Keepers Of The Law and Expert Citizens (choosing the caste of their expertise with a D6), and must catch Player A.

The first keeper’s (2nd player) is the senior partner & suspects that people are remembering past lives.

The second and junior keeper (3rd player) sees patterns in things.

The 4th & 5th players are expert witnesses called in by the keepers.

Any players beyond that play more keepers or experts.

Player A wins if they can commit all 6 murders without getting caught.

The other players win if they catch them prior to murder 6.

GM knows all & all players roll a die to see what number they are, but players only know who keepers and experts are.

## Fated to Meet – The Journey of Two

```
Requirements:

- 2 Players.
- 1 Symmetric board (chess, battleship).
- A *“cover”.
- Board pieces.

 
Create a Character and setting where it lives in. No relation between Characters is needed. Pieces representing each Character are placed on opposite sides of the board. Add the *cover to the board so Players see only their half (think battleship).

 
Both Players repeat at the same time:

[

Player A tells Player B a Theme relevant to A’s Character.
Player B sends media(pictures, video…) representing each possible next move for B’s Character (Characters move 1 step) to Player A. All moves start unmarked. For unmarked moves, choose a media according to the theme received, and mark the board (easily done with pieces of paper). For marked moves, send the representing media.
Player A chooses one received media, and Player B moves his Character accordingly.

]
Until Character(s)… :

 
…reaches the edge of the board(Except the starting Edge): 
Something bad happens. Describe it, and reposition your Character somewhere it has been before.


…crosses the middle: 
Worlds meet, and Characters see each other. Remove the cover. Players shouldn’t be able to tell which media represents which move.


…are next to each other:  
Describe their meeting. Congrats!


```
<hr> 

## S.P.Q.R.

```
Split the players into two teams. Each team must decide upon a Dictator. If there is a disagreement over who becomes the Dictator, declare both players Co-Dictators. Each Co-Dictator has a veto on the other’s actions.

Begin by consulting the sacred chickens: All players roll 1d6. If all players roll a 3 or above, the chickens feed, and the Battle begins. If a player rolls below a 3, the chickens do not feed, and all players re-roll.

If the sacred chickens do not feed three times, a Dictator may renounce their gods, rolling 1d6. If they roll a 6, the sacred chickens are thrown overboard and the Battle begins. If the Dictator rolls a 5 or below, they are assassinated by their soldiers, and their team loses the Battle.

Once in Battle, begin a Skirmish. Both teams play rock-paper-scissors. Defeated players are removed from the Field until one team emerges victorious. If a Dictator is defeated, their team loses the Skirmish, regardless of how many players remain on the field.

If a team loses three Skirmishes, they are routed from the field, losing the Battle.

If five Skirmishes pass and neither team wins, retreat to your camps for winter.

## Coming Close To Home - A Workshop

```
A workshop for prosaic games.
One facilitates the workshop – but all partake in Theme and Tale.
This is played in order.
 
-Theme-
Talk about themes in your game.

Facilitator points at someone.
That person says a word that springs to mind Immediately. No thinking. Then they point.
Proceed when there is flow.

-Tale-
Get an object.
Make two hand signs.

One for Zoom.
When used, the Speaker “zooms” in/out, interpreting it as they will – camera, feelings, perspective. No zoom police.

Another for Give
When used, the Speaker gives the object to another and becomes the Lens.

The person holding the object is the Speaker. Look at the Lens.
The Lens uses hand signs to direct the Speaker. Go slow.

Tell a coherent tale together.
Facilitator says 1 phrase, gives the object, becoming the Lens.

Proceed when it feels right.

-The Door-

Facilitator, speak dwellingly, slowly.
                       Bid them:
                       Close their eyes.
                       Breathe deeply.

Bid them Imagine a door.  Its…
               	       Shape
                       Texture

Bid them imagine a person is coming to the door. their...
                   	Steps
                      	Knocking, opening the door.
                       	Face
		        Body
                       Mannerisms                                   	
                     	Occupation.
                     	How they breathe

Bid them
                        Synchronize breath and mimic that person
                        Open their eyes.

That’s their character.

## Into Balance

```
Good or bad, the only guarantee is that your luck will someday reverse… The Universe will not bow to you. It craves only equilibrium. And sooner or later it will pull you back… Into Balance. 

This supplement is intended provide an alternative to dice rolling in systems Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA).

Convert your PbtA Stats into Gems by adding 2. For example, a +1 Stat becomes Three Gems.

Gather 35 gems in one colour and 65 in another. They should be otherwise identical. Place them all in a cloth bag.

When presented with a challenge, instead of rolling two dice, draw gems from the bag equal to your relevant Gems statistic.
You may draw blindly: If you draw one gem of the first colour, you have succeeded. If you draw two, you have succeeded greatly. (To the GM: A success is equivalent to a 7-9 result, a great success is a 10+)
You may guarantee failure: You may choose to draw only gems of the second colour for an action, guaranteeing failure to improve your odds later.

Once draw is resolved, set gems aside.

When the bag is empty, the universe is satisfied. Are you? Refill and be reborn.

## Strongman: Authoritarian Fun For 3+ Players

```
Each player is the Authoritarian ruler of their own country. On your turn you will announce a new Policy for your country. Will you require a certain minority to register with your government? Remove some group of undesirables from your voting rolls? Whatever you choose, be aggressive. Be strong.

During your turn, the other players represent your Parliament and must indicate whether they protest or support your decree. They do this by simultaneously dropping or not dropping a token, chosen in secret, with the following results:

0 protests - Score a point; Announce another Policy
1 protest - The protesting swine is sent to the Gulag; Announce another Policy
2+ protests - Parliament's loyalty is weak; Your turn ends
100% protest - You are Overthrown; Your turn ends

Gulag
Parliamentarians sent to the Gulag lose their next Announcing turn and voting eligibility for the remainder of the current turn.

Overthrown
If you are Overthrown you lose all your accumulated points.

One Parliamentarian Left
When only one Parliamentarian remains eligible to vote, you receive a 3 point bonus for stifling the opposition. Your turn ends.

Endgame
The first to reach 13 points is embraced as Big Brother, beloved by his people. Everyone else loses.

## Do You Drink the Kool-Aid

```
One Cult Leader, stat Zeal (5). Goal: convince Cultists to suicide (fictionally).
One Investigator, stat Alarm (5). Goal: convince Cultists to escape.
Remainder Cultists, stat Doubt (5). Goal: protect the cult.

Each turn, Leader makes Pronouncement (any statement). Investigator asks Leader and each Cultist questions about Pronouncement. Based on answers, characters’ stats change based on table. Each Cultists’ Doubt changes based on their response, Leader’s Zeal and Investigator’s Alarm change based on majority of Cultists’ response.

             Cultists Lie  Truth
Leader Lie   -1 Alarm      +1 Alarm
             +1 Doubt      +1 Doubt
             +1 Zeal       -1 Zeal
       Truth -1 Alarm      +1 Alarm
             -1 Doubt      -1 Doubt
             -1 Zeal       +1 Zeal

At end of any round, may do the following:
* Cultist attempts Flee. Roll 1d10+Doubt vs Leader’s 1d10+Zeal, If cultist’s roll is higher, they flee, otherwise, -1 Doubt.
* Investigator can Intervention one Cultist. Investigator rolls 1d10+Alarm vs cultist’s 1d10-Doubt. If investigator rolls higher, cultist escapes. Otherwise cultist -1 Doubt.

After >8 rounds, Leader can Pronouncement Suicide. Remaining Cultists have one chance to resist. Leader makes one 1d10+Zeal roll, each Cultist rolls 1d10+Doubt. Any Cultist who rolls higher than Leader resists, watches rest in horror.
```
<hr> 

## Living With Humans

```
You play as magical shapeshifting animals pretending to be humans in the modern world. You can shift between your human and animal form, and use magic to create illusions, manipulate nature, or do other trickster-ish things. 

You have two stats, called Mundane and Myth. Both start at 1.  

Whenever you try to do something difficult, roll 1d6 and add one of your stats; use mundane if you solve the problem through regular human means, use Myth if you solve the problem with your magic or your animal side. If the total is 6 or higher, you succeed. If the die rolls a 6, increase the stat you used by 1. 

If your Mundane reaches 5, you become fully human, lose your powers, and forget about ever being an animal. If your Myth reaches 5, you become an invisible spirit, and use your magic to play tricks on humans.

GMs, choose one thing from each list below and describe how each is a problem:
Mundane: Home, Money, Job, Love, Friends, Law 
Myth: Spirit, Debt, Curse, Monster, Shrine, Dream

Play until you resolve both problems, or all characters reach 5 in one of their stats.
```
<hr> 

## Doors

```
"You all stepped out your doors and into a whole other world. Now you must work together to find your way home."

COMPONENTS: Pencils & Paper. 2d6.

SETUP: 

Write your character name and description. Draw 6 unlabeled attribute boxes, and assign each a different value from 1 to 6.

PLAY: 

Randomly choose a player to be GM. They assign new labels to the 6 attribute boxes and describe the world players find themselves in.

Players act according to their new attributes while exploring this world, meeting NPCs, and finding their way home.

If taking an action with a reasonable chance of failure, or one which is opposed, the involved character(s) must pass a test. The GM determines the relevant attribute and circumstance modifier (positive or negative). The player(s) roll 2d6, then add the attribute value, modifier, and any relevant item modifiers. For unopposed tests, 12+ succeeds. For opposed tests, the higher total wins.

Players are human, and can handle minor damage, but serious injury results in lasting effects or death.

If players enter a door or analogue, they enter a new world. Immediately choose a new GM, who assigns new attribute labels and describes the next world to explore.
```
<hr> 

## Your journey

```
“The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.”

You are survivors in an apocalyptic wasteland, travelling between isolated cities in search of a place from your dreams. You never stay longer than three days. This game tells the story of the places you encounter on the way.

Character creation:
- Pick a unique quality and declare three ways you use it.
- Pick a flaw and explain why it haunts you.
- Pick a bond with someone and describe how you rely on them.

To start playing, think of some aspect of society and enlarge, twist, or reverse it. You arrive at a place where the people are like that. You try to understand those people and learn from them. You can observe them, interact with them, or fight them, but you never become one of them.

When you arrive, you have three tokens. Tell the others what you observe. When you learn something new, gain a token. To intervene, describe what you do. Either someone tells you what goes wrong and gives you a token, or you do it and discard a token. If you run out of tokens, you must leave this place, NOW.

## Just one wish away...

```
2 players 
1 dice(6)
Setting: A dschinn grants a person a wish. They are discussing,
what it should be.

READ ONLY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING ROLES
---> Person:
Roll d6 thrice. Write numbers down. Create a character with this
information.

First roll – missing in life: 1health, 2riches, 3power, 4body,
5skills, 6freedom

---> Dschinn:
old; cursed to fulfill every possible wish;  one wish is left
until curse is over: Roll  d6 (1health, 2riches, 3power, 4body,
5skills, 6freedom). Formulate wish that is missing to set you free
fitting to the topic diced. Write it down.

Rules for wishes you grant:
NO
-more wishes
-world-changing wishes
-wishes directly changing other people

Aim: Convince person to wish the wish you've formulated.

PLAY.

READ AFTER WISH IS GRANTED:
Person reads the dschinn's original wish and decides if dschinn is
set free.
Dschinn decides if actual wish was close enough to “missing in
life” rolled by person in the beginning for him/her to be happy
with in future life.
```
<hr> 

## Werewolf

```
To create a character you must choose skills. Any skill you can justify can exist. Each skill is tied to either your wolf side or your human side, determine this when creating the skill. Choose four tier 1 skills, three tier 2, two tier 3, and one tier 4. You have 2 stats, wolf and man. Both start at level 4.
Checks are resolved by rolling a number of dice equal to the tier of the skill, then gauging how many are greater than or equal to the success rating which is the level of the skill’s corresponding stat. The number of successes is compared to a number determined by the gm.
Skills increase by both succeeding and failing at them a number of times equal to the next tier's value, new skills can be acquired this way.
Keep track of how many times you use skills tied to Wolf or Man. For every 5 difference the skill used more decreases by 1 and the other increases by 1. Upon either stat reaching 7 your character leaves the game, either losing their humanity or their werewolf abilities.
GM: challenge players to find balance between Wolf and Man.

## A Day in the Life of a Mole Person

```
	Players have: 
•	6d personal resource counter. Ticks down one at day’s end unless resources scavenged. Set to 6. Character dies when personal counter reaches 0.
•	4d daily radiation modifier.

	Group has:
•	20d group resource counter. Ticks down # of players X1 at day’s end unless resources scavenged. Set to 3X # of players, this is the max (e.g. 5 players = 15 max, ticks down 5 daily). Everyone dies if group counter reach 0.
•	6d for scavenge and defense rolls.

	Describe nuclear wasteland:
•	Characters
•	Setting/Map
•	Enemy(s)

	Outset of day, for group: 
•	Decide on location to explore and needed resources. 
•	All roll personal radiation modifier. Subtract from scavenge (irradiated brain fog). Add to defense (mutant strength).

	Daily actions:
•	Players scavenge once. Player describes scavenging. Roll 6d minus modifier. 2-5 = success.
•	Success = player chooses. Hide resource (no personal tick down, add one instead) or contribute to group (first contributed scavenge = no group counter tick down. Second = uptick 1X # of players).
•	If scavenge fails, group describes attack. Roll 6d plus modifier. 6+ = attack defended. 2-5 = attacker injures player (player ticks personal counter down one).

```
<hr> 

## Marked

```
For two players -- powerful witches, locked in battle.

Materials: two markers.

Each witch chooses an aspect under their control -- fire, plants, time, etc. Draw a sigil for that aspect on the back of your non-dominant hand. When both players are ready, continue below.

The game is played in real time. Witches cast spells at each other by drawing sigils on their non-dominant arm -- more powerful spells require larger/more complex sigils. The spell is cast once the sigil is complete. The spell must be related to the sigil you drew (though make sure not to invoke any real magic) -- describe how you manipulate your aspect to attack your enemy, or provide a shield for later use, or serve any appropriate narrative purpose.

The game is over when one witch has killed the other, or both have surrendered. You are forced to surrender when your non-dominant arm runs out of space to draw on.

    Crewmate: Describes your body. How’s it gorgeous?
    Different crewmate: Describes the acquisition. Complications?
    Who finds it handsome? Why?

Choose Spirit or Somatics: +1d8 when rolling it.


Roll 3d8 plus…
    Spirit to get clever, subtle, willful, ghostly.
    Somatics for driving, physicality, passion, violence.
… +1d8 if a vehicle Trait applies.

Each 4+ is Ace, 1s are Trouble, otherwise a Flop.
Troubles cancel out Aces.
Evoke each personal Trait once per session to reroll any Troubles.
Assign uncancelled Aces to… 
    Things go as planned. Otherwise, how’d you screw up?
    You didn’t get hurt. Otherwise, what kinda hurt?
    Your hideous ghost stays hidden. Otherwise, how’d it get 
      complicated?
More Troubles than Aces? Big damage. Full-body rejection:

## Maximum Efficiency

```
Maximum Inefficiency, The Game

Maximum Inefficiency is a game for three or more players. The object of the game is to complete a simple task in a random, elevated number of individual non-repeatable actions, with emphasis on ridiculous solutions.
 Play begins by the players rolling two d6. The highest roller begins the game. That player becomes the Activity Director, who describes the start and end of a simple task.The Activity Director then rolls two d6 and adds six to the result. This number then defines the maximum number of actions required to fulfill the task.

Moving around the table clockwise, all the other players describe the method they use to fulfill the task. They may not repeat an action while describing the task, nor use more actions than rolled. After the player to the right of the Activity Director finishes his description, all players at the table then decide which player has made the most ridiculous solution to the problem. That player is awarded a point, and the next player clockwise becomes the Activity Director. Play continues until all players have been Activity Directors twice, after which the person with the most points wins.

## Descending from the Shoulders of Giants

```
You'll need:
A Guide & 2 to 6 players
index cards & pens

Each player writes a sentence describing a pivotal event in their character's life on their index card. A pivotal event is some form of conflict that changes the character's life. The events are kept secret for now.
One player is nominated to be the Descendant ("main character"); the others are automatically the Ancestors.
The Descendant reveals their pivotal event and starts roleplaying the scenario with the Guide.
While the current player role-plays, Ancestors can reveal their pivotal event and send one related thought or suggestion to any living being in that scene.
To see how the suggestion affects the current situation, the current event is paused and the Ancestor role-plays their pivotal event with the Guide. When the event is resolved, the previous event resumes.
Any elements from the Ancestor's events can now be brought into this scene.
It is suggested that Ancestors' events only go two layers deep to help keep things simple.
Once the Descendant's event is resolved, the game is complete.
Ancestors then sit back, content that they have helped their Descendant stand on the shoulders of giants.

## ✗amurai

```
Material: 25 Scrabble tiles, every letter except [S]

For each player:

The Samurai is a powerful being, holder of the Storied Sword.
This legendary weapon can grant its owner a single wish.
The only way to possess it is to defeat the current holder in a duel.

You need this wish. Why?

Draw a random letter [✗]. 
You’re now the ✗amurai – ✗murai if vowel.
Every choice you now make must start with letter ✗.

Choose your ✗-Weapon. (Bow, Zanbatō…)
How does it reflect your personality?

Choose your ✗-Totem. (Blood, Zebra…)
How does it help you in battle?

Choose your ✗-Weakness. (Blind, Zonked…)
Does it make you look badass?

The Samurai invited all their challengers to meet them.
But once there, you only see the other ✗amurais.
Is the Samurai one of them?

The GM hands you a secret letter.
[S] means you’re the Samurai in disguise.
Why are you hiding? Have you already made your wish?

✗amurais’s actions are always a success.
If it involves their ✗-Weakness, always a failure.

When ✗amurais are opposed, each draw a random letter.
Draw one more when ✗-Totem is advantageous.
The letter closest to [A] wins.
✗amurais may survive only one wound.

## Road Trippin’ on a Playlist

```
Get as many friends as you can fit into a car and ask yourselves “Where should we go?” – agree on a destination. Each traveler makes up a character: write their name and a short descriptive sentence. Shuffle characters so that nobody gets a character they created.

Make a playlist. Each traveler chooses two musics:
     - One that your character loves
     - One that relates to the destination somehow

Choose other tracks you’d like to add to it with any themes. Three musics in total per traveler are recommended. Do not reveal them to other travelers.

Now get into the car (or simulate one), fasten your seatbelts and start the engine! The shotgun puts the playlist on shuffle and the driver takes on the wheel.

When a music plays, follow these rules:
     - If your character loves it, have a conversation about what you’ll do at the 
       destination
     - If it relates to the destination, the driver speaks about the route – how 
       close/far from the destination are you and why?
     - For other musics, backseat travelers come up with a situation based on it

The shotgun may skip tracks if the conversation is stale.
You arrive at your destination when the playlist ends!

## Those Who Fled

```
3 to 5 players play the leaders of a community that escaped servitude under the Empire, into foothills where massed patrols of legionnaires can't follow.

Another player, the Adversary, plays the Empire, nature, and the spirit world.

Character creation: Name an advantage you have (eg: a skill, a type of magic, a weapon). The Adversary then names a threat (eg: a scarcity of food, a wandering Imperial patrol).

Threats have 11 strength by default; +3 during their season: Summer for the Empire, Winter for nature, Fall for the spirit world.

Each scene is a season, starting with Spring. Players take turns establishing a scene where they strike against threats. During Winter, the adversary establishes a scene instead.

Resolve challenges by rolling 3d6 against the strength of the threat you're struggling against. If you have an advantage, or if you are choosing to hide and escape instead of fighting, roll 4d6 instead and drop the lowest die.

At the end of each season:

- Decide whether the threat is defeated or becomes stronger (+1 strength).
- If all threats are defeated, the players narrate an ending.
- If a threat has 15 or more strength, the Adversary narrates an ending.

## Justice Court TV

```
What you need: 3 or more players, a TV show or movie to watch, and a timer.

Turn on and mute a show or movie. Designate one player as the Plaintiff and another as the Defendant, a third player becomes the Judge. Additional players become Witnesses. The Judge picks a case subject and it's time to play.

Set the timer to an agreed time, several minutes is suggested, the discussion ends when the alarm sounds and the Judge decides the winner of the case. The winner becomes the new Judge, picking the next case and choosing the show/movie.

Example Case:
Defendant ruined Plaintiff’s time machine by taking it back in time and a t-rex broke the am radio antenna.

21+ Rules: The Judge can deal out a punishment to the losing side and their Witnesses in the form of a number of sips of an alcoholic drink. Sips are determined by the roll of a six-sided die.

## Fear the Conspiracy

```
There's a CONSPIRACY.
You found EVIDENCE of its atrocities.
Now, THEY are AFTER YOU.

Bring a photograph, clipping, post-it, etc. to represent your evidence. In turns, pin your evidence to the board. Introduce yourself. Explain how you found your evidence, what frightening truth it exposes, and whether you FIGHT BACK, or RUN.

In turns, CONNECT EVIDENCE, using string to tie together pairs unconnected to each other. Explain to us how they’re connected, and how that either:
	- UNCOVERS a HIDDEN RESOURCE OR ALLY;
		-- Where is it? What, or who, is it?
	- GETS an UNCOVERED RESOURCE OR ALLY on your side;
		-- At what cost?
	- REVEALS a GOAL of THE CONSPIRACY;
 		-- Why is it horrifying?
	- Or DELAYS THEM, by sacrificing a RESOURCE, ALLY, or YOURSELF.

Whenever your evidence becomes part of any connection past its first, THE CONSPIRACY MOVES. Tell us how THEY either:
	- TAKE your evidence, and all RESOURCES and ALLIES it UNCOVERED;
	- ACHIEVE one GOAL. If none were known, one’s revealed;
	- DISPLAY their power, only if DELAYED. Now, they’re no longer DELAYED;
	- Or FIND YOU. You die, or worse.

When ALL evidence has more than one connection, your stories end. In turns, tell us how you DIED FIGHTING, or LOST EVERYTHING.

## Roommates From Hell

```
Character creation: 
Name, age, occupation, and three positive traits for your character.  Go in a circle and introduce yourselves to each other; as each roommate is introduced, write down a reason why you hate them.  Go around the circle again and read these reasons to each other, writing down what applies to your character.  Each player creates one House Rule.

House Rules: 
When you’re called out for breaking one, take a Blame Token.  When creating one, do not significantly remove another player’s agency.

Play: 
Take turns setting scenes by establishing something that’s gone wrong in the house.  Someone must be blamed for this.  Roommates may burst into the scene at any time, but must enter when mentioned.  Once all opinions have been voiced, set a minute timer; you must decide who’s to blame by its end.  Said player (or players) takes a Blame Token.  The player with the LEAST blame tokens creates a new House Rule, and the next player sets a scene.

Game end: 
Once all players have set two scenes, the player with the MOST Blame Tokens narrates the fate of the house.  Each player narrates their character’s fate.

## On Cuddling Dragons: A Primer for Beginners

```
It is a well known fact that slaying a dragon is very difficult. Cuddling one presents a whole new set of challenges! They’re spiny and thorny and tough, and they occasionally breathe fire or spit acid. Here’s a brief guide to help you through your difficult (but rewarding!) pursuit.

Step 1: Find an appropriate dragon to cuddle. (Find someone to play this larp with you)

Step 2: Go over the various parts of the dragon. Ask your dragon companion what parts of them are sharp, which parts should be avoided, etc. (The person playing the dragon should take this opportunity to tape weird, uncuddleable objects to their body. You’ll need a lot of tape. Suggestions include: Spoons. Toothpicks. Sandpaper. A tinfoil helmet. Leather work gloves. A pot on your head. Double sided tape. Boots. Etc.)

Step 3: The dragon lies on the floor curled up in a ball. You attempt to wrap yourself around the dragon. Try not to hurt yourself on the sharp bits. (The person playing the dragon should not make any attempt to be more cuddleable.)

Step 4: Bask in the knowledge that you are cuddling a dragon. (You lucky bastard.)

## The Trust

```
Three players are Corporations. Describe their names and industries.
One player is The People. Describe their land, their culture.

Corporations commission a factory (a square of paper). Describe its product.
Roll a d20 for factory OUTPUT.
Roll a d20 for factory COST.
Output minus cost equals NET. Write these on your factory. (Net can be negative).

Players take turns. The People go last.

Each turn, Corporations can:

- Commission or close one factory
- Change a factory’s OUTPUT or COST by 1
	or
- Steal a factory by grabbing it and increasing its COST. The robbed Corporation can grab it back, increasing COST again. This continues until someone gives up. Each increase is final and immediate. 

Narrate your actions. Be proud. Be profitable.

The People can:

- Make a request of any or all Corporations (ask for change in a factory’s COST or OUTPUT, beg to close or not close a factory). Corporations address (or ignore) these requests immediately.
	or
- Take action against one Corporation (Destroy a factory, transfer a factory to another Corporation). These can’t be stopped. 

Narrate your actions. Be convincing. Be vengeful.

Add each Corporation’s NET across all factories for a score. 

Highest score after four turns becomes The People.

## Monster's baby walker

```
After a ruination. everything's gone. The only thing you know is the girl in the photo you clenched, Leah. you climb out from the rubble. In front of you are unfamiliar things and fears. Winds and beasts lowing around. There are many signs you can't read. Even on the roads or on the building.
 
Try to survive and find her. Accidentally, when you're foraging and Kicked an alphabet block. It's so comforting and familiar. You can't understand what is the sign on it. Though, you realise they are everywhere. Like a child, you try to puzzle out those signs meaning. As you learning. Eventually, you are aware where you are.
 
All the way, people seem to disgust you. And trying to attack you, drive you away. But you don't know why. Until you perceive there are something differences between you and them. Because you are not a human anymore.
 
At last, you meet some people like you. They know where is your sister and brought you there. She is living in a fantastic room. She told you she was frozen in the room. But you can also travel with the people like you. How will you decide?
